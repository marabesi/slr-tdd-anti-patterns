Joint analysis of families of SE experiments,"Context: Replication is of paramount importance for building solid theories in experimental disciplines and is a cornerstone of the evolution of science. Over the last few years, the role of replication in software engineering (SE), families of experiments and the need to aggregate the results of groups of experiments have attracted special attention. Frameworks, taxonomies, processes, recommendations and guidelines for reporting replications have been proposed to support the replication of SE experiments. There has been much less debate about the issue of the joint analysis of replications whose raw data are available to experimenters. Objectives: The aim of our research is to explore current trends in the joint analysis of SE experiments whose raw data are available to experimenters. Notice that the fact that experimenters have access to the raw data is what differentiates joint analysis from other methods for aggregating experimental results (e.g. systematic literature review (SLR), where the applicability of meta-analysis techniques is widely accepted). The objective of this three-year investigation is to shed light on the best joint analysis approach when the experimenters have access to raw data from several replications. Method: Narrative comparison, standard frequentist methods, meta-analysis and Bayesian methods have been used in SE literature. We will apply and evaluate each approach to the experiments on Test-Driven Development (TDD) carried out within the Experimental Software Engineering Industrial Laboratory (ESEIL) project. We will propose and rate a tentative framework for aggregating results within the ESEIL project. The proposed framework, as well as the different existing methods, will be evaluated on another set of replications of testing technique experiments. Current status: The thesis proposal was elicited on the 15 January 2015 and rounded out over the following six months. As a three-year thesis, its discussion and findings will be projected across the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. The first results are now being aggregated with the data from four different experiments on TDD (two in academia and two in industry), and preliminary results are expected to be available in October 2015. © 2015 for this paper by its authors.",Parrilla A.S.,2015,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954476854&partnerID=40&md5=5b898b07de1f9f66f83f3ddb8da1f951
Considering rigor and relevance when evaluating test driven development: A systematic review,"Context Test driven development (TDD) has been extensively researched and compared to traditional approaches (test last development, TLD). Existing literature reviews show varying results for TDD. Objective This study investigates how the conclusions of existing literature reviews change when taking two study quality dimension into account, namely rigor and relevance. Method In this study a systematic literature review has been conducted and the results of the identified primary studies have been analyzed with respect to rigor and relevance scores using the assessment rubric proposed by Ivarsson and Gorschek 2011. Rigor and relevance are rated on a scale, which is explained in this paper. Four categories of studies were defined based on high/low rigor and relevance. Results We found that studies in the four categories come to different conclusions. In particular, studies with a high rigor and relevance scores show clear results for improvement in external quality, which seem to come with a loss of productivity. At the same time high rigor and relevance studies only investigate a small set of variables. Other categories contain many studies showing no difference, hence biasing the results negatively for the overall set of primary studies. Given the classification differences to previous literature reviews could be highlighted. Conclusion Strong indications are obtained that external quality is positively influenced, which has to be further substantiated by industry experiments and longitudinal case studies. Future studies in the high rigor and relevance category would contribute largely by focusing on a wider set of outcome variables (e.g. internal code quality). We also conclude that considering rigor and relevance in TDD evaluation is important given the differences in results between categories and in comparison to previous reviews. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Overlap between Automated Unit and Acceptance Testing - A Systematic Literature Review,"Unit and automated acceptance testing have different objectives (e.g., testing units of code versus testing complete features). Testing practices (e.g., test-first, model-based) used for one ""level""of testing (for either unit or acceptance testing) may require knowledge and skills that are not applicable to the other. This makes it difficult for practitioners to gain the skills required to effectively test at all levels and form a cohesive testing strategy. The aim of this systematic literature review is to understand whether there are any automated unit testing practices that have similarities with automated acceptance testing practices (and vice versa). Understanding these similarities can enable skill transfer across testing activities at different levels. This systematic literature review focuses on empirical research with an industry focus. We found that test-driven development (TDD) and model-based test generation (MBTG) are two practices widely researched for both unit testing and acceptance testing. For TDD we found that a design- and test-first mindset is required and helpful at both the unit and acceptance levels, but practitioners struggle with that practice. For MBTG we found that, despite its ability to increase code coverage, the additional manual effort to enable automated test generation may outweigh its benefits. © 2022 ACM.",Van Heugten Breurkes J.; Gilson F.; Galster M.,2022,Scopus,10.1145/3530019.3530028,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132393444&doi=10.1145%2f3530019.3530028&partnerID=40&md5=c911472cd8c88779c1eefdf0d2f0ba12
Test driven development contribution in universities in producing quality software: A systematic review,"Test driven development (TDD) is one of the Agile techniques adopted in education. TDD is an ideal approach to be taught in university due to its capability in producing quality software and at the same time teaching novice programmers to test and develop a product simultaneously. It helps novice programmers to think before they develop rather than using 'trial-and-error' approach in their project. However, based on the existing research, TDD contribution in producing a better quality and the perception among novice programmers towards it needs to be analyzed. This systematic review will identify the quality of a product produced by the students in university and also their perception towards TDD. © 2014 IEEE.",Yahya N.; Awang Abu Bakar N.S.,2014,Scopus,10.1109/ICT4M.2014.7020666,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946689405&doi=10.1109%2fICT4M.2014.7020666&partnerID=40&md5=02e863549f3bc0a835ea0f2f3ff5de56

Contract-driven development,"In spite of cultural difference between the corresponding scientific communities, recognition is growing that test-based and specification-based approaches to software development actually complement each other. The revival of interest in testing tools and techniques follows in particular from the popularity of ""Test-Driven Development""; rigorous specification and proofs have, for their part, also made considerable progress. There remains, however, a fundamental superiority of specifications over test: you can derive tests from a specification, but not the other way around. Contract-Driven Development is a new approach to systematic software construction combining ideas from Design by Contract, from TestDriven Development, from work on formal methods, and from advances in automatic testing as illustrated for example in our AutoTest tool. Like TDD it gives tests a central role in the development process, but these tests are deduced from possibly partial specifications (contracts) and directly supported by the development environment. This talk will explain the concepts and demonstrate their application. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",Meyer B.; Leitner A.,2007,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-37149039638&partnerID=40&md5=9a3a41f6676228175f35c6df4164a7f7

Empirical Study on 5G NR Cochannel Coexistence,"The 5G non-public network deployments for industrial applications are becoming highly interesting for industries and enterprises owing to dependable wireless performance characteris-tics. With an increasing trend of network deployments in local licensed and/or shared spectrum, coexistence issues naturally arise. In this article, we present our detailed empirical results on the performance impact of a 5G NR indoor non-public network from a 5G NR outdoor network operating in the same mid-band spectrum. We present experimental results on the uplink and downlink performance impact of a non-public indoor network deployed on an industrial shopfloor. Our results quantify the impact on the uplink and downlink performance characteristics based on realistic traffic loads in a non-public indoor network when using synchronized and unsynchronized Time Division Duplex (TDD) patterns, different UE deployment locations and interference levels. We also present results on mitigating interference effects through robust link adaptation techniques. We believe that this is the first article, which reports quantified 5G NR cochannel coexistence results based on a detailed and systematic study, and provides signficant insights on the cochannel coexistence behavior in realistic deployment scenarios of an industrial shopfloor. © 2022 by the authors.

Factors limiting industrial adoption of test driven development: A systematic review,"Test driven development (TDD) is one of the basic practices of agile software development and both academia and practitioners claim that TDD, to a certain extent, improves the quality of the code produced by developers. However, recent results suggest that this practice is not followed to the extent preferred by industry. In order to pinpoint specific obstacles limiting its industrial adoption we have conducted a systematic literature review on empirical studies explicitly focusing on TDD as well as indirectly addressing TDD. Our review has identified seven limiting factors viz., increased development time, insufficient TDD experience/knowledge, lack of upfront design, domain and tool specific issues, lack of developer skill in writing test cases, insufficient adherence to TDD protocol, and legacy code. The results of this study is of special importance to the testing community, since it outlines the direction for further detailed scientific investigations as well as highlights the requirement of guidelines to overcome these limiting factors for successful industrial adoption of TDD. © 2011 IEEE.",Causevic A.; Sundmark D.; Punnekkat S.,2011,Scopus,10.1109/ICST.2011.19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79958704204&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2011.19&partnerID=40&md5=00af8c7789ab4d911323443e7aba9203
Outage performance analysis for fractional frequency reused TDD-OFDMA systems with asymmetric traffics,"In this paper, we present an analytical approach to design the inner region size for the fractional frequency reused (FFR) time division duplex (TDD) orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems when supporting asymmetrical traffic services. In TDD system, supporting asymmetrical traffic can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of downlink and uplink transmission period. Nevertheless, the intercell interference may be deteriorated by the cross-slot interference resulting from the different downlink and uplink ratios among neighboring cells. Although the FFR technique can overcome the inter-cell interference, the impact of the cross-slot interference of TDD systems due to various downlink to uplink traffic ratios in different cells on the inner region size of a FFR-based OFDMA system is an open issue to our best knowledge. Intuitively, the larger the inner region of a FFR system, the higher the system capacity. Thus, this paper can provide a systematic method to determine the size of the inner region of FFR-based OFDMA system for different ratios of the downlink to uplink traffic among two neighbor cells. © 2010 IEEE.",Wang L.-C.; Li W.-C.,2010,Scopus,10.1109/ISITA.2010.5649531,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78651293665&doi=10.1109%2fISITA.2010.5649531&partnerID=40&md5=b217ef8d1c20d0e30d2e99b8d4167cab
Exploring pilot assignment methods for pilot contamination mitigation in massive MIMO systems,"In massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antenna system, the performance is restricted by inter-cell interference called pilot contamination. However, acquisition of channel state information for channel estimation introduces overheads of pilots required to estimate the channel frequently, a disadvantage that causes inefficient use of bandwidth. A tradeoff thus exists between the number of pilots required to estimate the channel versus the spectral efficiency. Studies on pilot decontamination using pilot assignment lack consideration of the comparative analysis to determine superior approaches. Limited literature exists on the analysis of the existing pilot assignment techniques. Different techniques exhibit varied performances and influence on resource utilization. The purpose of this study is to analyze various methods of pilot assignment schemes for mitigation of pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems. A systematic review approach is adopted to examine different related works and the adopted methodologies, outcomes, and restrictions to determine the most suitable approaches. This study further demonstrates the impact of coherence interval distribution between the pilots for channel estimation and data transmission. An analysis of a tradeoff between FDD and TDD modes is presented to determine the most suitable for massive MIMO antennas. In addition, the study provides recommendations for future research. © 2020 The Author(s).

"Achieving ""massive MIMO"" spectral efficiency with a not-so-large number of antennas","Time-Division Duplexing (TDD) allows to estimate the downlink channels for an arbitrarily large number of base station antennas from a finite number of orthogonal uplink pilot signals, by exploiting channel reciprocity. Based on this observation, a recently proposed ""Massive MIMO"" scheme was shown to achieve unprecedented spectral efficiency in realistic conditions of distance-dependent pathloss and channel coherence time and bandwidth. The main focus and contribution of this paper is an improved Network-MIMO TDD architecture achieving spectral efficiencies comparable with ""Massive MIMO"", with one order of magnitude fewer antennas per active user per cell (roughly, from 500 to 50 antennas). The proposed architecture is based on a family of Network-MIMO schemes defined by small clusters of cooperating base stations, zero-forcing multiuser MIMO precoding with suitable inter-cluster interference mitigation constraints, uplink pilot signals allocation and frequency reuse across cells. The key idea consists of partitioning the users into equivalence classes, optimizing the Network-MIMO scheme for each equivalence class, and letting a scheduler allocate the channel time-frequency dimensions to the different classes in order to maximize a suitable network utility function that captures a desired notion of fairness. This results in a mixed-mode Network-MIMO architecture, where different schemes, each of which is optimized for the served user equivalence class, are multiplexed in time-frequency. In order to carry out the performance analysis and the optimization of the proposed architecture in a systematic and computationally efficient way, we consider the large-system regime where the number of users, the number of antennas, and the channel coherence block length go to infinity with fixed ratios. © 2012 IEEE.",Huh H.; Caire G.; Papadopoulos H.C.; Ramprashad S.A.,2012,Scopus,10.1109/TWC.2012.070912.111383,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866742088&doi=10.1109%2fTWC.2012.070912.111383&partnerID=40&md5=c2f2618c0c1018ff3229ed7851f72a26

Heterogeneous Networks in LTE-Advanced,"A comprehensive summary of theoretical and practical developments in LTE Heterogeneous Networks. The last decade has witnessed the proliferation of mobile broadband data and the trend is likely to increase in the coming years. Current cellular networks are ill equipped to deal with this surge in demand. To satisfy user demand and maximize profits, a new paradigm to operate networks is needed. Heterogeneous networks, that deploy an overlay of small cells with limited coverage and transmit power, over a macro coverage area is the solution by providing capacity and coverage where it is needed. This book presents a comprehensive overview of small cell based heterogeneous networks within the framework of 3GPP LTE-Advanced which is the major enabler of current and future heterogeneous networks. The book first establishes the basics of LTE standards 8 -10. Wherever relevant, the underlying theory of wireless communications is explained and the signaling and protocol aspects of LTE Releases 8-10 are presented. Next the book presents a systematic study of the inter cell interference (eICIC and FeICIC) mechanisms that have been standardized in LTE releases 10 and 11 to mitigate the interference arising in heterogeneous networks. From simple blank subframe design and implementation, the book discusses more advanced transceiver signal processing and carrier aggregation (CA) based mechanisms to improve performance. Besides data, control channel enhancements such as enhanced PDCCH (ePDCCH) are also discussed. Subsequently the book discusses the possibility of base stations being allowed to coordinate to manage interference. This technique, called CoMP, has the potential of vastly improving network performance. However several practical challenges first have to be overcome before this potential can be realized. The book presents the different CoMP categories introduced in LTE release 11, the required signal processing and the changes that were introduced in Release-11 for supporting CoMP. The book then presents the state of the art developments in heterogeneous networks that are currently taking place in 3GPP with the initiation of Release 12. A whole array of new technologies have been introduced such as dynamic switching of small cells, new carrier types with reduced control signaling, dynamic reconfiguration of TDD-LTE, joint configuration of TDD and FDD via carrier aggregation and lastly advanced MIMO signal processing with three dimensional beamforming. All these technologies will work in unison leading to efficient operations of small cells. The authors thus comprehensively summarize the advances in heterogeneous networks over the last couple of years as reflected in various LTE releases and then look ahead at what to expect in the future. Fully illustrated throughout and with an accompanying website including Matlab code for simulating heterogeneous networks, LTE channel models, and References to 3GPP specifications, contributions, and updates on recent standardization activities.

Asymptotic Performance Analysis and Degree Distribution Design for Systematic Luby Transform Codes over Binary Erasure Channel,"The asymptotic performance formula of systematic LT codes(SLT) in binary erasure channel (BEC) is firstly derived based on AND-OR tree analysis and its lower limit is given. Simulation results show that the actual bit error ratio(BER), the asymptotic performance and the lower limit match each other perfectly when the overhead is large enough. Then the optimization of degree distribution is proposed by the improved systematic linear programming(ISLP) model in accordance with the asymptotic performance. The optimized degree distribution is obviously superior to robust soliton distribution(RSD) and truncated degree distribution(TDD). Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior of the optimized degree distribution can be controlled by the given overhead and BER. In other words, the ideal BER can be obtained within the overhead we want, which also influences the overhead for complete decoding. Simulation results show that the overhead required for data recovery is close to that of we set. The comparison of BER, the overhead required for data recovery and the time of encoding and decoding for LT codes and SLT codes show that SLT codes have better performance than LT codes with more quick speed in data recovery. © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Data Acquisition and Processing.

Designing multi-agent unit tests using systematic test design patterns-(extended version),"Software agents are the basic building blocks in many software systems especially those based on artificial intelligence methods, e.g., reinforcement learning based multi-agent systems (MASs). However, testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy, distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows MAS developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the JUnit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Pex - An intelligent assistant for rigorous developer testing,"Pex takes test-driven development to the next level. Pex analyzes .NET applications. From a parameterized unit test, which serves as a specification, it automatically produces traditional unit tests cases with high code coverage. Moreover, when a generated test fails, Pex can often suggest a bug fix. To do so Pex performs a systematic program analysis (similar to path bounded model-checking). It records detailed execution traces of test cases. Pex learns the program behavior from the traces, and a constraint solver produces new test cases with different behavior. The result is a minimal test suite with maximal code coverage.

Since the amount of systematic error is unknown in the beginning of a call and after each handover, the outer loop power control should adapt to the current conditions as fast as possible.

The effects of test-driven development on external quality and productivity: A meta-analysis,"This paper provides a systematic meta-analysis of 27 studies that investigate the impact of Test-Driven Development (TDD) on external code quality and productivity. The results indicate that, in general, TDD has a small positive effect on quality but little to no discernible effect on productivity. However, subgroup analysis has found both the quality improvement and the productivity drop to be much larger in industrial studies in comparison with academic studies. A larger drop of productivity was found in studies where the difference in test effort between the TDD and the control group's process was significant. A larger improvement in quality was also found in the academic studies when the difference in test effort is substantial; however, no conclusion could be derived regarding the industrial studies due to the lack of data. Finally, the influence of developer experience and task size as moderator variables was investigated, and a statistically significant positive correlation was found between task size and the magnitude of the improvement in quality. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",Rafique Y.; Mǐsí V.B.,2013,Scopus,10.1109/TSE.2012.28,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878407475&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2012.28&partnerID=40&md5=aba3bb7ecff9e03988de97d26814c59f

Designing multi-agent unit tests using systematic test design patterns,"Following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows Multi-Agent System (MAS) developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the junit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide an analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations. © 2011 IADIS.",Nagi K.M.; Khamis M.A.,2011,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865088554&partnerID=40&md5=32d3ab6856d22c3a62b37298a05612f8
"On the rate adaptation and scheduling design of downlink multi-user, multiple-antenna base station with imperfect CSIT","In this paper, we investigate the downlink rate adaptation and scheduling design in multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We shall propose a systematic design framework to address the rate adaptation and multi-user scheduling combined design based on information theoretical framework. We assume time division duplex (TDD) systems with quasi-static fading channels where packet outage is an important concern with imperfect CSIT. A lower bound on the mutual information of a MISO link in the presence of CSI errors is derived. Based on this lower bound, we present a closed form expression for the average goodput of each user, with packet outage taken into account. Numerical results demonstrate that, by considering the statistic of CSIT errors into the design, the proposed schemes provide significant goodput enhancement. © 2005 IEEE.",Lau V.K.N.; Jiang M.,2005,Scopus,10.1109/VETECF.2005.1558205,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84931334145&doi=10.1109%2fVETECF.2005.1558205&partnerID=40&md5=9db79e7dec51d4bc409c77d955544b71
Handover and Uplink Power Control Performance in the 3.84 Mcps TDD mode of UTRA Network,"In this article we consider the performance of the 3.84 Mcps time-division duplex (TDD) mode of UTRA (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access) network. We emphasize two of the radio resource management algorithms, handover and uplink power control, whose role in the overall system performance is studied extensively. First, a handover algorithm used in WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) standard is considered in a TDD-mode operation. This gives rise to a careful setting of different handover parameters, and the evaluation of the effects to the system performance. Secondly, the specified uplink power control algorithm is considered. Since it is based on several user-made measurements which may involve both random and systematic errors a careful study about the suitability of the power control scheme is carried out.",Kurjenniemi J.; Hämäläinen S.; Ristaniemi T.,2003,Scopus,10.1023/B:WIRE.0000012271.26918.a6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1042265988&doi=10.1023%2fB%3aWIRE.0000012271.26918.a6&partnerID=40&md5=ada99df454a6085e18347a77a191516c
The TDDonto tool for test-driven development of DL knowledge bases,"Adding knowledge to an ontology lacks a verification step by the modeller in most cases, other than 'try and see what the reasoner says about it'. This is due to the lack of a systematic testbed for ontology authoring. Reusing the notion of Test-Driven Development (TDD) from software engineering for ontology development resulted in the specification of 42 test types for the SROIQ language features, as TBox tests using its axioms and as ABox-driven tests with explicitly introduced individuals. We developed TDDOnto, which implements that subset of the TDD tests that could be done by leveraging extant technologies. We examined what the most efficient implementation strategy is with 82 ontologies. The TBox SPARQL queries with OWL-BGP were faster than the ABox-based approach except for disjointness, that effect is more pronounced with larger ontologies, and the OWL API approach is faster than the SPARQL queries for OWL 1 ontologies. A significant difference in performance between OWL and OWL 2 DL ontologies was observed. On average, the TDD tests are faster than classification reasoning, indicating that TDD tests are a promising alternative to the 'try and see' approach in ontology authoring. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

A comprehensive survey of TDD-based mobile communication systems from TD-SCDMA 3G to TD-LTE(A) 4G and 5G directions,"TDD (Time Division Duplex) is one of the two duplex modes. TD-SCDMA (Time Division Synchronous CDMA) is the first TDD-based cellular mobile system which is commercialized in wide area and large scale and TD-SCDMA is also the first cellular mobile system which adopted smart antenna technology (also called as beamforming). As the long term evolution of TD-SCDMA, TD-LTE(A) (Time Division-Long Term Evolution, and TD-LTE Advanced) introduced OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and enhanced smart antenna technology together with MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output), which are adopted by LTE FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) either. It is indicated that TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE(A) have opened a sustainable utilization era of TDD and smart antenna technologies in the wireless mobile communication. This paper aims to present a systematic introduction to TDD-based mobile communications from TD-SCDMA to TD-LTE and beyond, with particular focuses on TDD key technologies, principles of TDD cellular mobile systems, TDD evolution path, and future TDD 5G directions. The comparisons between TDD and FDD are also included.

Test-driven development of ontologies,"Emerging ontology authoring methods to add knowledge to an ontology focus on ameliorating the validation bottleneck. The verification of the newly added axiom is still one of trying and seeing what the reasoner says, because a systematic testbed for ontology authoring is missing. We sought to address this by introducing the approach of testdriven development for ontology authoring. We specify 36 generic tests, as TBox queries and TBox axioms tested through individuals, and structure their inner workings in an ‘open box’-way, which cover the OWL 2 DL language features. This is implemented as a Protégé plugin so that one can perform a TDD test as a black box test. We evaluated the two test approaches on their performance.

The effect of Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development on Project Success Factors: A Systematic Literature Review Based Study,"Agile testing approaches test-driven development (TDD), behavior-driven development (BDD); have gained popularity since the introduction of agile practices. The concept of using these approaches in software projects is to help projects succeed. The effect of TDD and BDD on Project success factors namely, cost, time, and customer satisfaction/external quality, remains an area of investigation. Therefore, this study investigates the results of previously published articles on the effect of TDD and BDD on project success factors. A systematic literature review has been conducted considering articles published between 1999 up to 2020. Thirty-one studies were selected and analyzed. 74.1% of studies are experiments, 25.8% are case studies. 67.7% of these studies were performed in an industrial setting, 29.0% were performed in an academic setting and only one study with 3.22% was mixed academic and industrial settings. The result shows that the TDD and the BDD consume more time and cost compared to traditional testing (TLD). Moreover, the TDD as TLD may not necessarily satisfy the customer unlike the BDD appears that achieve customer satisfaction. Although, when TDD compared to BDD, TDD consumed more time and lower customer acceptance than the BDD. © 2021 IEEE.",Abushama H.M.; Alassam H.A.; Elhaj F.A.,2021,Scopus,10.1109/ICCCEEE49695.2021.9429593,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107133513&doi=10.1109%2fICCCEEE49695.2021.9429593&partnerID=40&md5=d319166df0c75cf75c65ae75f08bf3d1
The adaptation of test-driven software processes to industrial automation engineering,"Software components provide an increasing part of added value in automation systems and become more complex to construct and test. Test-driven development (TDD) of software systems has been successfully used for agile development of business software systems. Test cases guide the system implementation and can be executed automatically after software changes (continuous integration & build strategy). However, TDD processes need to be adapted to control automation systems engineering, where real-world systems are challenging to model and to test automatically. In this paper we introduce an adapted TDD process from the business software engineering domain to industrial automation engineering. We identify a set of UML models that enable the systematic derivation of test cases. Based on an initial empirical study we evaluate the adapted TDD process based on an industrial use case to identify strength and limitation of this approach. Major results of the study were that UML models enabled effective test case derivation in the study context. © 2010 IEEE.",Hametner R.; Winkler D.; Östreicher T.; Biffl S.; Zoitl A.,2010,Scopus,10.1109/INDIN.2010.5549620,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956566051&doi=10.1109%2fINDIN.2010.5549620&partnerID=40&md5=96b208508eb12d175a70ed72cc352909

The Perception of Test Driven Development in Computer Science - Outline for a Structured Literature Review,"Test driven development (TDD) is a practice that aims to improve product quality and maintainability by interweaving the design and implementation with its testing. It is most prominent in the software development domain. However, its usefulness is not undisputed, making it a somewhat controversial topic. Besides giving a short introduction regarding the principles of TDD, the publication at hand motivates and outlines a structured literature review to obtain new insights regarding the perception of TDD in computer science, hopefully contributing to the corresponding discourse. Furthermore, by already conducting the first steps of the review, it provides a first impression regarding the vastness of the potentially relevant literature base and gives a rough indication regarding the extend that is to be expected for the completed work.","Lautenschlager, Erik",2022,"BUSINESS INFORMATION SYSTEMS WORKSHOPS, BIS 2021",10.1007/978-3-031-04216-4_13,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-04216-4_13
Identifying Guidelines for Test-Driven Development in Software Engineering-A Literature Review,"With the significance, ubiquity, and complexity of information technology continuously rising, the corresponding quality assurance becomes increasingly important and challenging. Consequently, numerous tools, techniques, paradigms, and strategies that facilitate the quality assurance of the developed applications have emerged. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of those strategies. In contrast to the traditional approach, it places testing ahead of the actual implementation, which, in turn, also heavily influences the system's design. With the approach being rather complex, naturally, guidance on its correct application is one of the most relevant aspects for many practitioners. To provide assistance to them, but also to researchers concerned with the domain, the publication at hand identifies twenty guidelines for the practical application of TDD in software engineering, by conducting a structured literature review. In doing so, it provides a solid foundation for the implementation of corresponding endeavors as well as a starting point for further discussion.","Staegemann, Daniel; Volk, Matthias; Pohl, Matthias; Haertel, Christian; Hintsch, Johannes; Turowski, Klaus",2023,"PROCEEDINGS OF SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, VOL 4",10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30
Considering rigor and relevance when evaluating test driven development: A systematic review,"Context: Test driven development (TDD) has been extensively researched and compared to traditional approaches (test last development, TLD). Existing literature reviews show varying results for TDD. Objective: This study investigates how the conclusions of existing literature reviews change when taking two study quality dimension into account, namely rigor and relevance. Method: In this study a systematic literature review has been conducted and the results of the identified primary studies have been analyzed with respect to rigor and relevance scores using the assessment rubric proposed by Ivarsson and Gorschek 2011. Rigor and relevance are rated on a scale, which is explained in this paper. Four categories of studies were defined based on high/low rigor and relevance. Results: We found that studies in the four categories come to different conclusions. In particular, studies with a high rigor and relevance scores show clear results for improvement in external quality, which seem to come with a loss of productivity. At the same time high rigor and relevance studies only investigate a small set of variables. Other categories contain many studies showing no difference, hence biasing the results negatively for the overall set of primary studies. Given the classification differences to previous literature reviews could be highlighted. Conclusion: Strong indications are obtained that external quality is positively influenced, which has to be further substantiated by industry experiments and longitudinal case studies. Future studies in the high rigor and relevance category would contribute largely by focusing on a wider set of outcome variables (e.g. internal code quality). We also conclude that considering rigor and relevance in TDD evaluation is important given the differences in results between categories and in comparison to previous reviews. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Modeling and Performance Analysis of Scrumban with Test-Driven Development using Discrete Event and Fuzzy Logic,"Project management in the software industry has been constantly evolving its development practices. One practice that has been standing out in recent years is Test Driven Development (TDD). However, there is no consensus in the literature about the impact of TDD on the productivity of development teams. Furthermore, no studies were found that analyzed the productivity impact of TDD practitioners in relation to the variations of total project term and complexity of product. Based on three case studies, organized in 18 scenarios, this work used modeling and discrete-event simulation to investigate the impact of TDD on team productivity. The results showed that both factors, total project duration and product complexity, do influence the productivity of the software development team that adopts TDD practice and the most advantageous scenarios were identified. A Fuzzy Logical System was also implemented that recommends TDD based on these two variables.","Sambinelli, Fernando; Ursini, Edson L.; Borges, Marcos A.

Improving business agility through technical solutions: A case study on test-driven development in mobile software development,"This paper maintains that efficient business agility requires actions from all levels of the organization in order to strive for success in a turbulent business environment. Agility and agile software development solutions are suggested as yielding benefit in a volatile environment, which is characterized by continuously changing requirements and unstable development technologies. Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile practice where the tests are written before the actual program code. TDD is a technical enabler for increasing agility at the developer and product project levels. Existing empirical literature on TDD has demonstrated increased productivity and more robust code, among other important benefits. This paper reports results of a case study where a mobile application was developed for global markets, using the TDD approach. Our first results show that the adoption of TDD is difficult and the potential agility benefits may not be readily available.

Two Models for Noisy Feedback in MIMO Channels,"Two distinct models of feedback, suited for FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) and TDD (Frequency Division Duplex) systems respectively, have been widely studied in the literature. In this paper, we compare these two models of feedback in terms of the diversity multiplexing tradeoff for varying amount of channel state information at the terminals. We find that, when all imperfections are accounted for, the maximum achievable diversity order in FDD systems matches the diversity order in TDD systems. TDD systems achieve better diversity order at higher multiplexing gains. In FDD systems, the maximum diversity order can be achieved with just a single bit of feedback. Additional bits of feedback (perfect or imperfect) do not affect the diversity order if the receiver does not know the channel state information.","Aggarwal, Vaneet; Krishna, Gajanana; Bhashyam, Srikrishna; Sabharwal, Ashutosh",2008,"2008 42ND ASILOMAR CONFERENCE ON SIGNALS, SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS, VOLS 1-4",10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074502,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.2008.5074502

Assessing The Effectiveness Of Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development in an Industry Setting,"Agile software development deviates from the traditional and plan-based approaches to software engineering as its iterative cycles embrace changes in software requirements. Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) are techniques that have been recently adopted by the software industry and have evolved from agile practices. These techniques aim at improving both the quality of the delivered software and the developers' productivity. They are several studies that have been conducted on TDD in both academic and industry settings with however only a few on BDD. While TDD and BDD have both become popular, many organizations and developers still do not understand the differences between these concepts or where they overlap. The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of these two approaches in terms of external code quality, internal code quality and developers' productivity. To understand the weaknesses and strengths of each of these methods, a literature review was first performed. An experiment was then carried out in an industry setting to observe the effectiveness of TDD and BDD on a number of subjects. Our results showed that both techniques indeed increased the external quality of the delivered product. However, a decrease in productivity and internal quality were noted when BDD was used compared to TDD which might be due to the additional steps involved in BDD.","Dookhun, Avishek Sharma; Nagowah, Leckraj",2019,PROCEEDINGS OF 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY (ICCIKE' 2019),,https://doi.org/
Frame Structure Design for Massive MIMO Systems-PHY Perspective,"In wireless communications, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in which the base station (BS) is equipped with a large number of antennas can provide significant spectral and energy efficiency by means of simple signal processing. Therefore, massive MIMO is an attractive technology for next generation wireless conununication systems and for green communications. There are two operation modes: time-division duplex (TDD) and frequency-division duplex (FDD) for massive MIMO systems, and the debate on the two modes is still discussed in the literature. The originator of massive MIMO systems, Marzetta, has presented the basic frame structures for both the TDD and the FDD modes. However, the basic frame structures do not carefully take the hardware impairments such as phase noise (PN) into account. In this paper, by taking the PN as the key hardware impairment into account, we recommend new and efficient frame structures for both the TDD and the EDI) modes. The corresponding performance comparison between the two modes is also provided by using the data transmission efficiency (DTE) as the performance measurement. The comparison may help determine which mode should he used for massive MIMO systems.","Wang, Yi-Fan; Lee, Ju-Hong",2018,2018 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (WCNC),,https://doi.org/
An Analytical Framework for Effective Joint Scheduling Over TDD-Based Mobile Networks,"The growing demand for data along with the emergence of new communication standards have reshaped wireless networks through a denser base station deployment, an increasing traffic heterogeneity, and an additional complexity in quality of service (QoS) assurance. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is considered as one technique to be used in next generation wireless networks. Utilizing time division duplexing (TDD) aids the management of resources and providing effective QoS. In the literature, common approaches in assessing effectiveness attempt to capture performance using single indicators that reflect one aspect of the network's operation. consequently, multi-objective evaluations are not easy and require intuitively considering isolated descriptions, plots, visualizations, and holistically performing multiple comparisons. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework that aims to classify the effectiveness of joint scheduling algorithms over TDD-OFDMA networks per combined heterogeneous properties. In the suggested framework, a designer benefits from a bouquet of carefully customized indicators that can lead to quality evaluations, performance classifications beyond traditional approaches, and accurate improvements. Validation includes exhaustive simulations and the assessment of different scheduling and performance classification schemes. The obtained results confirm the validity of the framework and confirms its effectiveness in application.","Damaj, Issam W.; El Hajj, Ahmad M.; Mouftah, Hussein T.",2019,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945849,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945849
Joint Optimization of User Association and Dynamic TDD for Ultra-Dense Networks,"tlltra-dense small cell networks will require sophisticated user association algorithms that consider (i) channel characteristics, (ii) base station load, and (iii) uplinkldownlink (UL/DL) traffic profiles. They will also be characterized by high spatio-temporal variability in UL/DL traffic demand, due to the fewer users per BS. In this direction,l)ynamic TDD is a promising new technique to match BS resources to actual demand. While plenty of literature exists on the problem of user association, and some recent on dynamic TI)I), most works consider these separately. In this paper, we argue that user association policies are strongly coupled with the allocation of resources between UL and DL. We propose an algorithm that decomposes the problem into separate subproblems that can each be solved efficiently and in a distributed manner, and prove convergence to the global optimum. Simulation results suggest that our approach can improve UL and DL performance at the same time, with an aggregate improvement of more than 2x, compared to user association under static TDD allocation.","Sapountzis, Nikolaos; Spyropoulos, Thrasyvoulos; Nikaein, Navid; Salim, Umer",2018,IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS (IEEE INFOCOM 2018),,https://doi.org/
Investigating the Impact of Development Task on External Quality in Test-Driven Development: An Industry Experiment,"Reviews on test-driven development (TDD) studies suggest that the conflicting results reported in the literature are due to unobserved factors, such as the tasks used in the experiments, and highlight that there are very few industry experiments conducted with professionals. The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of a new factor, the chosen task, and the development approach on external quality in an industrial experimental setting with 17 professionals. The participants are junior to senior developers in programming with Java, beginner to novice in unit testing, JUnit, and they have no prior experience in TDD. The experimental design is a 2 x 2 cross-over, i.e., we use two tasks for each of the two approaches, namely TDD and incremental test-last development (ITLD). Our results reveal that both development approach and task are significant factors with regards to the external quality achieved by the participants. More specifically, the participants produce higher quality code during ITLD in which splitting user stories into subtasks, coding, and testing activities are followed, compared to TDD. The results also indicate that the participants produce higher quality code during the implementation of Bowling Score Keeper, compared to that of Mars Rover API, although they perceived both tasks as of similar complexity. An interaction between the development approach and task could not be observed in this experiment. We conclude that variables that have not been explored so often, such as the extent to which the task is specified in terms of smaller subtasks, and developers' unit testing experience might be critical factors in TDD experiments. The real-world appliance of TDD and its implications on external quality still remain to be challenging unless these uncontrolled and unconsidered factors are further investigated by researchers in both academic and industrial settings.","Tosun, Ayse; Dieste, Oscar; Vegas, Sira; Pfahl, Dietmar; Rungi, Kerli; Juristo, Natalia",2021,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1109/TSE.2019.2949811,https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2019.2949811
On Channel Estimation of Uplink TDD Massive MIMO Systems Through Different Pilot Structures,"This work is considered as a comparative study in which the quality of channel estimation (CE) in massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) systems is studied by operating atUplink (UL) phase according to a time division duplex (TDD) scheme using commonly known channel estimators existing in the literature. The least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimators are investigated with three categories of pilots, namely regular pilots (RPs), time-superimposed (or superimposed) pilots and staggered pilots (StP). Two patterns of frequency reuse (FR) per category are used. The simulation results showed that by increasing the number of BS antennas with a fixed number of symbols dedicated to the UL phase and vice versa, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the LS and MMSE estimators using the superimposed pilot (SuP) or StP is asymptotically approaches the NMSE of the LS and MMSE estimators using the RP, respectively. An asymptotic behavior is studied for two different FR scenarios.","Amadid, Jamal; Boulouird, Mohamed; Riadi, Abdelhamid; Hassani, Moha M'Rabet",2022,"NETWORKING, INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND SECURITY",10.1007/978-981-16-3637-0_12,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-3637-0_12
Research on Coverage and Networking Capability of 5G 40M FDD Bandwidth Enhancement Compared with 100M TDD,"3GPP Release 16 will freeze the 2.1GHz FDD NR enhanced 40M large bandwidth standard in July 2020. At present, a small number of terminals have experimental capability. In the 3.5GHz TDD NR network with 100M bandwidth, how to use 2.1GHz FDD NR has become a hot issue in the industry. This paper compares the coverage and capacity of 2.1GHz FDD NR and 3.5GHz TDD NR through link budget and theoretical calculation; compares the uplink and downlink coverage of the two systems through single station pull-out experiment; selects the existing network with 2.1GHz FDD NR and 3.5GHz TDD NR deployed at the same site as the experimental site, and analyzes the uplink and downlink networking capacity of the two systems through Driving Test (DT). Considering the influence of the number of transmitting antennas of existing terminals and the transmitting power of network equipment on the network planning, the network capacity of this experiment includes 2.1GHz 4T4R and 3.5G 64TR, the terminal capacity includes 2.1GHz 1T4R, 2.1GHz 2T4R and 3.5GHz 2T4R, and the power consumption of network equipment involves 2.1GHz: 4x4OW and 4x6OW; 3.5GHz: 160W and 200W. At present, there is no literature about the existing network experiment of multi-power consumption and multiterminal type, so this paper has important reference significance for operators to deploy 2.1GHz+3.5GHz network.","Zhou, Yuetian; Wei, Mingshuo; Hu, Chunlei; Xu, Xiaohang; Xie, Weiliang",2021,2021 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT COMPUTING AND WIRELESS OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS (ICWOC),10.1109/ICWOC52624.2021.9529964,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWOC52624.2021.9529964
Non-linear frequency synchronization algorithm for TDD-LCR system,"The frequency synchronization procedure is essential to a mobile set in order to calibrate its reference oscillator. In TDD Low Chip Rate (LCR) UMTS system after the frequency scan procedure; which aims to find the carrier frequency, an error as great as 20 kHz is expected [1]. The requested maximum frequency offset, between the local oscillator and the Node B oscillator is 200 Hz (0.1 ppm). The aim of this paper is to present a frequency recovery algorithm suited for the TDDLCR system and to verify if the requested precision of 0.1 ppm is reachable with the proposed frame format [2]. Many data aided frequency estimators are proposed in literature [3][4]. In this paper the best suitable estimator for TDDLCR, described in [5], is fitted to the TDDLCR system and an original non linear closed loop approach, which improves performance, is proposed. The performance results show that a combination of an open loop estimation with a closed loop configuration, exploiting two different training sequences, assure a final accuracy of 0.1 ppm, even in the worst environment conditions. The modified non linear recursive algorithm, introduced in the closed loop configuration, is a promising approach to increase accuracy and to reduce convergence time.","Cangemi, C; Ventura, A",2002,"13TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERSONAL, INDOOR AND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS, VOL 1-5, PROCEEDINGS: SAILING THE WAVES OF THE WIRELESS OCEANS",,https://doi.org/
Multicarrier Division Duplex Aided Millimeter Wave Communications,"The existing time-division duplex (TDD) and frequency-division duplex (FDD) techniques rely on a guard time and/or a guard band to avoid self-interference (SI) between the uplink and downlink channels, which results in the wastage of precious spectral resources. The full-duplex (FD) schemes of in-band FD (IBFD), as well as multicarrier division duplex (MDD), may overcome this drawback while retaining the key benefits of both TDD and FDD. Moreover, the MDD exhibits the exclusive benefits of the reduced peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) for signal transmission as well as the SI-free signal detection. Against this background, in this paper, we propose a novel FD scheme conceived for frequency-selective millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels, which have not been investigated in the open literature. Furthermore, we propose a novel projection-aided iterative eigenvalue decomposition (P-IEVD) algorithm, which performs null-space SI cancellation in the inherent beamforming structure of mmWave communication. Our simulation results confirm that the MDD is capable of outperforming its half-duplex (HD) counterparts of the TDD/FDD, even the IBFD can only achieve a better bandwidth efficiency than the MDD when a sufficiently high SNR is provided.","Rajashekar, Rakshith; Xu, Chao; Ishikawa, Naoki; Yang, Lie-Liang; Hanzo, Lajos",2019,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930333,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930333
Transmit diversity for TDD systems,"Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communications have been a hot research area in recent years. Most literature makes the assumption that the channel information is not known at the transmitter but known perfectly at the receiver. We focus on the situation where both the transmitter and the receiver know the channel information. We consider a transmit diversity scheme that maximizes the signal to noise ratio at the receiver. We analyze its performance in terms of capacity, duality and asymptotic behavior. By simulation, we compare this scheme with Alamouti's transmit diversity to show the advantage of utilizing the channel side information to improve the performance of the wireless systems.","Wang, JB; Yao, K",2002,"ADVANCED SIGNAL PROCESSING ALGORITHMS, ARCHITECTURES, AND IMPLEMENTATIONS XII",10.1117/12.453834,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.453834
A Comprehensive Survey of Pilot Contamination in Massive MIMO-5G System,"Massive MIMO has been recognized as a promising technology to meet the demand for higher data capacity for mobile networks in 2020 and beyond. Although promising, each base station needs accurate estimation of the channel state information (CSI), either through feedback or channel reciprocity schemes in order to achieve the benefits of massive MIMO in practice. Time division duplex (TDD) has been suggested as a better mode to acquire timely CSI in massive MIMO systems. The use of non-orthogonal pilot schemes, proposed for channel estimation in multi-cell TDD networks, is considered as a major source of pilot contamination in the literature due to the limitations of coherence time. Given the importance of pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems, we provide an extensive survey on pilot contamination, and identify other possible sources of pilot contamination, which include hardware impairment and non-reciprocal transceivers. We review established theories that have analyzed the effect of pilot contamination on the performance of massive MIMO systems, particularly on achievable rates. Next, we categorize the different proposed mitigation techniques for pilot contamination using the following taxonomy: pilot-based approach and subspace-based approach. Finally, we highlight the open issues, such as training overhead, deployment scenario, computational complexity, use of channel reciprocity, and conclude with broader perspective and a look at future trends in pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems.","Elijah, Olakunle; Leow, Chee Yen; Rahman, Tharek Abdul; Nunoo, Solomon; Iliya, Solomon Zakwoi",2016,IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS,10.1109/COMST.2015.2504379,https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2504379
X- and Y-Codes for MIMO Precoding,"We consider a time division duplex (TDD) n(t) x n(r) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with known channel state information (CSI) at both transmitter and receiver. Using singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding at the transmitter, the MIMO channels are transformed into parallel subchannels. To improve the low diversity order, we propose X-and Y-Codes, prior to SVD precoding, to pair subchannels having different diversity orders. Specifically, a pair of channels is jointly encoded using a 2 x 2 real matrix, which is fixed a priori and does not change with each channel realization. Moreover, we propose X-, Y-Precoders with the same encoding matrices as X-, Y-Codes, which adapt to each channel realization. The optimal encoding matrices for X-and Y-Codes/Precoders are derived analytically to minimize the average error probability. Finally, we see that X-, Y-Codes/Precoders indeed achieve higher diversity gains at very low encoding/decoding complexity for both well-and ill-conditioned channels, respectively, when compared to other precoding schemes in the literature. We also observe that for the Rayleigh fading channel model X-and Y-Codes/Precoders exhibit the best average error performance.","Mohammed, Saif Khan; Viterbo, Emanuele; Hong, Yi; Chockalingam, Ananthanarayanan",2010,2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY,10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513455,https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513455
I/Q Linear Phase Imbalance Estimation Technique of the Wideband Zero-IF Receiver,"The in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance encountered in the zero-IF receiver leads to incomplete image frequency suppression, which severely deteriorates image rejection ratio (IRR) of the receiver system and must be improved using additional analog or digital signal processing. The I/Q linear phase imbalance (LPI) is the key of the I/Q imbalance, which consists of the time delay deviation (TDD) and the local oscillator (LO) phase offset. TDD is negligible in most literature, but it degrades system performance largely for wideband communication systems. This paper proposes a method based on the cross-power spectrum between the I/Q signal to address the estimation problem of LPI. Compared with other conventional methods, the proposed approach calculates LPI parameters simultaneously without any additional hardware. The MATLAB simulation is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the presented method. Moreover, the experimental platform of detailed design demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed estimation method, and IRR of the system before and after compensation shows that LPI has been accurately estimated and eliminated with the help of an appropriate compensation structure. Both reveal that the proposed method offers an effective solution to the LPI problem.","Meng, Jie; Wang, Houjun; Ye, Peng; Zhao, Yu; Guo, Lianping; Zeng, Hao; Tian, Yu",2020,ELECTRONICS,10.3390/electronics9111787,https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics9111787
Fairness-based Scheduling Algorithm for TDD Mode IEEE 802.16 Broadband Wireless Access Systems,"IEEE 802.16 standards specify four types of services, while how to design an efficient scheduling algorithm remains an open issue. Manufacturers can implement their own scheduling algorithms depending on their specific requirements. There are a lot of scheduling algorithms proposed in the literature. Several scheduling algorithms propose hierarchical structures with strict priority or one-level scheduling mechanism. They are based conceptually on the round-robin approaches. However, they don't consider an important factor: fairness. In this paper we propose a fairness strategy algorithm for IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless access networks. The proposed algorithm applies a fairness strategy to utilize the system bandwidth, to achieve the QoS requirements of high priority service flows, and to reduce starvations of low priority service flows. The simulation studies show that the proposed scheduling algorithm provides a flexible way to utilize the system bandwidth.","Cheng, Sheng-Tzong; Chen, Bo-Fu; Chou, Chih-Lun",2008,"2008 IEEE ASIA-PACIFIC SERVICES COMPUTING CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3, PROCEEDINGS",10.1109/APSCC.2008.73,https://doi.org/10.1109/APSCC.2008.73
A FULLY-DISTRIBUTED CONTROL TIME SLOT ASSIGNMENT PROTOCOL FOR LARGE WIRELESS MESH NETWORKS,"A control time slot assignment protocol is developed for time division multiple access (TDMA) and time division duplex (TDD)-based large wireless mesh networks (WMNs). Through the protocol, each wireless mesh router acquires a broadcast time slot that supports a minimum average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to all of its neighbors. The protocol employs contention -based reservation mechanisms in a topology-dependent way and executes in a fully-distributed manner It explicitly takes into account vagaries of radio propagation and co-channel interference, often oversimplified in the literature. A computer simulator is created that implements realistic large-scale radio propagation and considers all co-channel interferers in the network. Through simulations, protocol performance is determined for different wireless system factors including shadowing. In addition, a power control scheme is proposed to better utilize time slots. Results show that the protocol indeed guarantees a minimum average SINR for all links between a pair of neighbors in all simulated scenarios.","Lee, Hyunok; Cox, Donald C.",2008,"2008 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE: MILCOM 2008, VOLS 1-7",,https://doi.org/
The impacts of agile and lean practices on project constraints: A tertiary study,"The growing interest in Agile and Lean software development is reflected in the increasing number of secondary studies on the benefits and limitations of Agile and Lean processes and practices. The aim of this tertiary study is to consolidate empirical evidence regarding Agile and Lean practices and their respective impacts on project constraints as defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK): scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources, communication, and risk. In this tertiary study, 13 secondary studies were included for detailed analysis. Given the heterogeneity of the data, we were unable to perform a rigorous synthesis. Instead, we mapped the identified Agile and Lean practices, and their impacts on the project constraints described in PMBOK. From 13 secondary studies, we identified 13 Agile and Lean practices. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is studied in ten secondary studies, meanwhile other practices are studied in only one or two secondary studies. This tertiary study provides a consolidated view of the impacts of Agile and Lean practices. The result of this tertiary study indicates that TDD has a positive impact on external quality. However, due to insufficient data or contradictory results, we were unable to make inferences on other Agile and Lean practices.

Thyroid disease diagnosis via hybrid architecture composing rough data sets theory and machine learning algorithms,"This work is a hybrid architecture design furnished successfully using artificial intelligence techniques, rough data sets theory and machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this work is to bring the spotless and smart approach in identifying the thyroid disease in a human. There are several mechanisms implemented on thyroid data sets which produced astonished outcomes, but the data considered for the thyroid disease diagnoses (TDD) is inconsistent, redundant and consists of missing attribute values as per my literature survey. The proposed work is to construct an expert advisory system of hybrid architecture, which is to determine the optimistic disease growth because of the thyroid gland. A string matching system (SMS) was at the outset developed, which can predict the actual TDD based on the knowledge available. If the SMS fails, an individual approaches using artificial bee colony optimization and particle swarm optimization are developed to achieve the accuracy of results appreciating the measure values as 65 and 93 %, but the results obtained using the above said approaches are calculated using some missed attribute values which are not included in the knowledge likewise left blank and hence the proposed work continues to first generate the missing attribute value in the knowledge by using rough data sets theory and the obtained data (missed attribute values) is given to predict optimistic disease along with its prevention and its curing methods. However, the data generated cannot predict the optimal disease and hence it is proposed to use a machine learning algorithm so that, obtained result is hygienic.

Practical methods for constructing suffix trees,"Sequence datasets are ubiquitous in modern life-science applications, and querying sequences is a common and critical operation in many of these applications. The suffix tree is a versatile data structure that can be used to evaluate a wide variety of queries on sequence datasets, including evaluating exact and approximate string matches, and finding repeat patterns. However, methods for constructing suffix trees are often very time-consuming, especially for suffix trees that are large and do not fit in the available main memory. Even when the suffix tree fits in memory, it turns out that the processor cache behavior of theoretically optimal suffix tree construction methods is poor, resulting in poor performance. Currently, there are a large number of algorithms for constructing suffix trees, but the practical tradeoffs in using these algorithms for different scenarios are not well characterized. In this paper, we explore suffix tree construction algorithms over a wide spectrum of data sources and sizes. First, we show that on modern processors, a cache-efficient algorithm with O(n(2)p) worst-case complexity outperforms popular linear time algorithms like Ukkonen and McCreight, even for in-memory construction. For larger datasets, the disk I/O requirement quickly becomes the bottleneck in each algorithm's performance. To address this problem, we describe two approaches. First, we present a buffer management strategy for the O(n(2)) algorithm. The resulting new algorithm, which we call Top Down Disk-based (TDD), scales to sizes much larger than have been previously described in literature. This approach far outperforms the best known disk-based construction methods. Second, we present a new disk-based suffix tree construction algorithm that is based on a sort-merge paradigm, and show that for constructing very large suffix trees with very little resources, this algorithm is more efficient than TDD.","Tian, YY; Tata, S; Hankins, RA; Patel, JM",2005,VLDB JOURNAL,10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8
SLINR-Based Downlink Optimization in MU-MIMO Networks,"Optimizing the downlink of multi-cell multiuser multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) networks has received substantial attention; however, the schemes in the literature consider centralized solutions requiring significant overhead in information exchange (e.g., global channel state information or CSI) and computation load (the need to solve a single large problem). This paper presents a decentralized weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization algorithm for the multiuser downlink, accounting for beamforming, scheduling, and power allocation. We show that the signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) used in previous work suffers from significant drawbacks that limit its potential use in WSR maximization. We address this by proposing a new performance measure, the signal-to-leakage-plus-interference-plus-noise ratio (SLINR), which incorporates intra-cell interference and inter-cell leakage. The SLINR exploits the benefits of the SLNR approach, but by explicitly including interference, avoids many of its flaws. We derive an iterative and decentralized resource allocation approach under imperfect CSI, and our simulation results show that, despite BSs using only local information, the proposed algorithm comes within 3.8% of the throughput achieved by centralized schemes.","Gamvrelis, Tyler; Li, Zehua; Khan, Ahmad Ali; Adve, Raviraj S.",2022,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3224197,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3224197
Achieving Phase Coherency and Gain Stability in Active Antenna Arrays for Sub-6 GHz FDD and TDD FD-MIMO: Challenges and Solutions,"Full-dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO) using planar active antenna systems (AAS) is considered a critical technology for fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems to improve network capacity. An AAS is typically subject to hardware impairments that negatively impact network capacity. Hence, this article focuses on impairments that cause phase and magnitude errors between radio frequency (RF) chains and shows why they are particularly difficult to avoid in practical AAS. Although previous investigations show these impairments to degrade performance, they are not useful in deriving measurable impairment margins for practical FD-MIMO deployments. Knowing impairment limits are critical for system designers to make hardware design tradeoffs such as AAS configuration, component selection, implementation complexity, and cost. Moreover, it also helps set conformance limits for critical lab verification. Therefore, the paper first investigates the impact of the impairments and derives their practical limits for FD-MIMO by explicitly considering the cumulative effects of the channel model, inter-cell interference, link adaptation, and channel aging due to feedback delays. It is shown that a lower number of digitized RF chains can be a better choice under lower impairments. Next, the sources of impairments are investigated by using measurements carried out in the lab and the field during live operation in a commercial LTE network. Phase drift from local oscillators (LO) and internal temperature variations are identified as two significant sources. The tradeoffs and shortcomings of some of the existing solutions in massive MIMO literature are discussed. Finally, in order to address the shortcomings, a novel and practical coherent LO distribution architecture and array calibration mechanism are proposed. This solution is shown to be applicable to both TDD and FDD FD-MIMO. Measurement results are provided to prove the high degree of coherency and stability achieved on a unique array architecture called high definition active antenna system (HDAAS).","Vaghefi, Reza Monir; Palat, Ramesh Chembil; Marzin, Giovanni; Basavaraju, Kiran; Feng, Yiping; Banu, Mihai",2020,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018393,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018393
Video Action Classification Using Symmelets and Deep Learning,"Classification of human actions is very challenging and important in many video-based applications. Two common features, i.e., the hand-crafted and the deep-learned ones are usually adopted for video representation and have been proven to be effective in many famous datasets in the literature. However, the hand-crafted feature lacks the ability to detect the discriminative and semantic features and the deep-learned one fails to outperform previous hand-crafted feature. This paper propose a novel symmelet-based classification approach to improve the accuracy of the state-of-the-art frameworks. Symmelet is a symmetrical pair including a SURF point and its corresponding symmetrical point in the same frame. Many symmetrical properties often exist in various video scenes. With symmelets, various redundant (or background) features can be filtered out so that action contents can be more accurately represented. The new approach takes advantages of symmelets, improved dense trajectories (IDT), and trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD) to learn useful deep features for represent video contents deeply. Performance evaluation on two challenging datasets, i.e., HMDB51 and UCF101 shows that the proposed solution is superior and can achieve quite higher recognition accuracy than other state-of-art frameworks.","Alghyaline, Salah; Hsieh, Jun-Wei; Chuang, Chi-Hung",2017,"2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)",,https://doi.org/
A WIMAX MIMO Network Architecture Exploiting Spatial Diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites,"This paper presents a framework to exploit the Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) technique in the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WIMAX) physical layer. MIMO is an established standard in the WIMAX family, however practical literature on the exploitation of MIMO in WIMAX networks focused on treating the paradoxical situation of demand for Line Of Sight (LOS) in microwave communications against the essential MIMO prerequisite, i.e., the Non LOS (NLOS) and multi fade paths. This framework proposes a novel approach to exploit potentials of MIMO in WIMAX networks. This is achieved by exploiting spatial diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites (MAS) to create artificial NLOS environment, whereby, MAS(s) are encapsulated as antennas in a large scale frame. This presents a significant enhancement of the existing schemes, which highlighted the exploitation of the combination of Time Division Duplexing (TDD), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and MIMO for Multiple Access Points (MAP(s)) in a Single Frequency Network (SFN). In this paper, the network is divided into layers and the above exploitation of MIMO is realised between these layers in a network-to-network communication scenario. The resulting network is characterized by high capacities at distribution access points and ease of design by virtue of combination of SFN and spatial techniques.","El Sanousi, Geili T.

Channel Estimation for TDD Uplink Massive MIMO Systems via Compressed Sensing,"Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (Massive MIMO) is expected to be one of the key feature technology for the next cellular communication networks due to its significant benefits in terms of energy efficiency and increased spectral. To fully exploit these advantages, an accurate estimation of the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) between each transmit-receive antenna pair is crucial. In literature, it has been demonstrated that wireless communication tends to have a sparse structured CIR in delay and/or spatial domains. Several channel estimation strategies have exploited the sparsity in the massive MIMO channel based on additional assumptions on shared common support between uplink channels. In this paper, we propose a general approach which highlights the individual sparsity in the different uplink channels without any other additional assumption. To achieve this purpose, a training sequence, also known as pilot sequence and compressed sensing based CIR estimation techniques have been proposed for the massive MIMO sparse uplink channels. In order to underline the performance of proposed techniques, a comparison in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) is performed with other CS algorithms. The simulation results have shown that proposed algorithm presents a performance gain between 5 dB and 10 dB in terms of NMSE, and a gain of 1dB to 9dB in terms of BER.","Lahbib, Noura Derria; Cherif, Maha; Hizem, Moez; Bouallegue, Ridha",2019,2019 15TH INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IWCMC),,https://doi.org/
Are there any Unit Tests? An Empirical Study on Unit Testing in Open Source Python Projects,"Unit testing is an essential practice in Extreme Programming (XP) and Test-driven Development (TDD) and used in many software lifecycle models. Additionally, a lot of literature deals with this topic. Therefore, it can be expected that it is widely used among developers. Despite its importance, there is no empirical study which investigates, whether unit tests are used by developers in real life projects at all. This paper presents such a study, where we collected and analyzed data from over 70K revisions of 10 different Python projects. Based on two different definitions of unit testing, we calculated the actual number of unit tests and compared it with the expected number (as inferred from the intentions of the developers), had a look at the mocking behavior of developers, and at the evolution of the number of unit tests. Our main findings show, (i) that developers believe that they are developing more unit tests than they actually do, (ii) most projects have a very small amount of unit tests, (iii) developers make use of mocks, but these do not have a significant influence on the number of unit tests, (iv) four different patterns for the evolution of the number of unit tests could be detected, and (v) the used unit test definition has an influence on the results.","Trautsch, Fabian; Grabowski, Jens",2017,"2017 10TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE TESTING, VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION (ICST)",10.1109/ICST.2017.26,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICST.2017.26
"Coordination of inventory and shipment consolidation decisions: A review of premises, models, and justification","This chapter takes into account the latest industrial trends in integrated logistical management and focuses on recent supply-chain initiatives that enable the integration of inventory and transportation decisions. The specific initiatives of interest include Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI), Third Party Warehousing/Distribution (3PW/D), and Time Definite Delivery (TDD) applications. Under these initiatives, substantial savings can be realized by carefully incorporating all outbound shipment strategy with inventory replenishment decisions. The impact is particularly tangible when the shipment strategy calls for a consolidation program where several smaller deliveries are dispatched as a single combined load, thereby realizing the scale economies inherent in transportation. Recognizing a need for analytical research in the field, this chapter concentrates on two central areas in shipment consolidation: i) analysis of pure consolidation policies where a shipment consolidation program is implemented on its own without coordination, and ii) analysis of integrated policies where outbound consolidation and inventory control decisions are coordinated under recent supply-chain initiatives. The chapter presents a research agenda, as well as a review of the related literature, in these two areas. Some of the recent findings of the methodological research are summarized, and current and future research endeavors are discussed. By offering a theoretical framework for modeling recent supply-chain initiatives, the chapter highlights some of the many challenging practical problems in this emerging field.","Cetinkaya, S",2005,APPLICATIONS OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT AND E-COMMERCE RESEARCH,10.1007/0-387-23392-X_1,https://doi.org/10.1007/0-387-23392-X_1
Channel Estimation Capacity Enhancement for Multigroup Multicasting Multimedia Networks With DnCNN,"In Time Domain Duplex (TDD) massive MIMO systems, multi-group multi-casting becomes a promising technology since it supports services of mass content distribution. Based on the nature of transmitting common message to groups of users simultaneously, there exists a rich literature discussing the resource allocation under various constraints. However, the practical acquisition of CSI has not been fully explored when the number of multi-groups is large and the band is narrow. The insufficient sounding reference signal resources lead to the limited Channel Estimation Capacity (CEC). Under this case, even with Multi-User (MU) channel estimation techniques, some users still cannot be estimated in-timely, which introduces degradation. Aiming at this problem, in this paper we provide a preliminary exploration on CEC enhancement. Based on Denoising Convolutional Neuron Network (DnCNN), which is recently proposed and has succeeded in image denoising, we propose MU-DnCNN Channel Estimation (M-DnCNN CE). M-DnCNN CE includes three parts. First, we modify the utilization of SRS sequences. Then we establish the feature maps and propose M-DnCNN to denoise the signals. Finally, a matched channel restoration method is provided. The practical 3-D MIMO channel model is utilized to evaluate the performance. Compared with DFT-based and conjugated separation methods, results show that the performance of M-DnCNN CE is robust and superior, and the CEC is remarkably improved on the premise of satisfying latency constraint.","Zeng, Tianyi; Wang, Yafeng; Li, Junyao; Hou, Shuai",2019,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958060,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958060
Pilot Sequence-based Channel Estimation in Massive MIMO wireless communication networks under strong Pilot Contamination,"This work provides a straightforward channel estimator to overcome an unrealistic property provided by Minimum Mean Square Error Estimator (MMSEE) for Multi-Cell (MC) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) systems operating under Time-Division Duplex (TDD) protocol. Besides, this work is in purpose to study and analyze the current ideal Least-Squares Estimator (LSE), the current ideal MMSEE, and the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) under various circumstances and considering under Pilot Contamination (PC) problems. This work compared and evaluate the performance of the studied estimators using the metric Mean Square Error (MSE). The traditional LSE provides the worst performance under a high interference level since it is considerably affected by PC. In spite of the greater accuracy achieved by MMSEE in many studies in the literature. However, the MMSEE is relying on an unrealistic assumption, which can be explained by the complete knowledge of among cell large-scale fading (LSF) coefficients as an unrealistic hypothesis in practical use. The suggested estimator (i.e., the MLE) is introduced to overcome the unusable property on which the MMSEE is based. Besides, the MLE is introduced to provides higher performance than LSE. Furthermore, we investigate a scenario of LSF coefficient (i.e., a LSF depends on the distance at which the user is located from its serving Base Station (BS)), wherewith we assert our analysis. An analytical, simulated, and approximated, results are provided for MLE to affirm our study, whereas analytical and simulated results are given for both LSE and MMSEE to assert the presented theoretical expressions.","Amadid, Jamal; El Ouadi, Zakaria; Wakrim, Layla; Khabba, Asma; Zeroual, Abdelouhab",2022,2022 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DECISION AID SCIENCES AND APPLICATIONS (DASA),10.1109/DASA54658.2022.9765195,https://doi.org/10.1109/DASA54658.2022.9765195
A successful application of a Test-Driven Development strategy in the industrial environment,"Unit Test-Driven Development (UTDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) are software development techniques to incrementally develop software where the test cases, unit or acceptance tests respectively, are specified before the functional code. There are little empirical evidences supporting or refuting the utility of these techniques in an industrial context. Just a few case studies can be found in literature within the industrial environment and they show conflicting results (positive, negative and neutral). In this report, we present a successful application of UTDD in combination with ATDD in a commercial project. By successful we mean that the project goals are reached without an extra economic cost. All the UTDD and ATDD implementations are based on the same basic concepts, but they may differ in specific adaptations to each project or team. In the implementation presented here, the business requirements are specified by means of executable acceptance tests, which then are the input of a development process where the functional code is written in response to specific unit tests. Our goal is to share our successful experience in a specific project from an empirical point of view. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of adopting UTDD and ATDD and identify some conditions that facilitate success. The main conclusions we draw from this project are that ATDD contributes to clearly capture and validate the business requirements, but it requires an extensive cooperation from the customer; and that UTDD has not a significant impact neither on productivity nor on software quality. These results cannot be generalized, but they point out that under some circumstances a test-driven development strategy can be a possible option to take into account by software professionals.","Latorre, Roberto",2014,EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1007/s10664-013-9281-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-013-9281-9
Total Energy Efficiency of TR-MRC and FD-MRC Receivers for Massive MIMO Uplink,"This paper proposes a detailed investigation on the uplink (UL) performance of massive multiple-input-multipleoutput (maMIMO) systems employing maximum-ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver. While most papers in maMIMO literature assume orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), current standards such as long-term evolution (LTE) employ single-carrier (SC) waveform in the UL because of several benefits. We, thus, perform a systemic comparison between two fundamental schemes: the time-reversal MRC (TR-MRC) operating under SC, and the frequency-domain MRC (FD-MRC) employed with OFDM. On the one hand, it was recently shown that the TR-MRC outperforms the FD-MRC in terms of achievable rates, since SC systems do not require the cyclic prefix of OFDM. On the other hand, the computational complexity of the TR-MRC algorithm is higher than that of the FD-MRC algorithm, even when efficient solutions are employed (e.g., fast convolution with the overlap-andadd method). Hence, the best scheme for the UL maMIMO systems still remains an open question. The main contribution of this paper is the comparison of the total energy efficiency of both the TR-MRC and FD-MRC algorithms when used in the UL of maMIMO systems. Our results show that, for current typical system parameters, the FD-MRC/OFDM scheme achieves higher total energy efficiency than that achieved by the TR-MRC/SC scheme. However, if the cell radius is less than 300 m and/or the computational efficiency increases by 30% regarding the current processors, the TR-MRC algorithm under SC waveform becomes a much more attractive alternative for the UL of maMIMO systems.","Marinello Filho, Jose Carlos; Panazio, Cristiano; Abrao, Taufik; Tomasin, Stefano",2019,IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL,10.1109/JSYST.2019.2896221,https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2019.2896221
Uplink-Downlink Channel Covariance Transformations and Precoding Design for FDD Massive MIMO,"A large majority of cellular networks deployed today make use of Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) where, in contrast with Time Division Duplexing (TDD), the channel reciprocity does not hold and explicit downlink (DL) probing and uplink (UL) feedback are required in order to achieve spatial multiplexing gain. In order to support massive MIMO, i.e., a very large number of antennas at the base station (BS) side, the overhead incurred by conventional DL probing and UL feedback schemes scales linearly with the number of BS antennas and, therefore, may be very large. In this paper, we present a new approach to achieve a very competitive trade-off between spatial multiplexing gain and probing-feedback overhead in such systems. Our approach is based on two novel methods: (i) an efficient regularization technique based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that learns the Angular Spread Function (ASF) of users channels and permits to estimate the DL covariance matrix from the noisy i.i.d. channel observations obtained freely via UL pilots (UL-DL covariance transformation), (ii) a novel sparsifying precoding technique that uses the estimated DL covariance matrix from (i) and imposes a controlled sparsity on the DL channel such that given any assigned DL pilot dimension, it is able to find an optimal sparsity level and a corresponding sparsifying precoder for which the effective channel vectors after sparsification can be estimated at the BS with a low mean-square error. We compare our proposed DNN-based method in (i) with other methods in the literature via numerical simulations and show that it yields a very competitive performance. We also compare our sparsifying precoder in (ii) with the state-of-the-art statistical beamforming methods under the assumption that those methods also have access to the covariance knowledge in the DL and show that our method yields higher spectral efficiency since it uses in addition the instantaneous channel information after sparsification.","Khalilsarai, Mandi Barzegar; Song, Yi; Yang, Tianyu; Haghighatshoar, Saeid; Caire, Giuseppe",2019,"CONFERENCE RECORD OF THE 2019 FIFTY-THIRD ASILOMAR CONFERENCE ON SIGNALS, SYSTEMS & COMPUTERS",,https://doi.org/
