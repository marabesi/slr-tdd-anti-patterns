This work explores the way in which Junit tests are written in real world Java systems. We analyse 112 Java repositories and measure the quality of unit tests by finding patterns which indicate good practices of coding. Our results show that the quality of real world unit tests is low, and that in many cases, unit tests don't follow the well-known recommendations for writing unit tests. These early results demonstrate the need for more tools and techniques for refactoring of tests.;;;;;;Ma'ayan, Dor/0000-0002-7290-2789;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-5737-1;;;;2018;;;;;;;33;36;;10.1145/3194095.3194102;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3194095.3194102;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000449622800006;

Additionally, a lot of literature deals with this topic. Therefore, it can be expected that it is widely used among developers. Despite its importance, there is no empirical study which investigates, whether unit tests are used by developers in real life projects at all. This paper presents such a study, where we collected and analyzed data from over 70K revisions of 10 different Python projects. Based on two different definitions of unit testing, we calculated the actual number of unit tests and compared it with the expected number (as inferred from the intentions of the developers), had a look at the mocking behavior of developers, and at the evolution of the number of unit tests. Our main findings show, (i) that developers believe that they are developing more unit tests than they actually do, (ii) most projects have a very small amount of unit tests, (iii) developers make use of mocks, but these do not have a significant influence on the number of unit tests, (iv) four different patterns for the evolution of the number of unit tests could be detected, and (v) the used unit test definition has an influence on the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2381-2834;;978-1-5090-6031-3;;;;2017;;;;;;;207;218;;10.1109/ICST.2017.26;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICST.2017.26;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000403393600019;

It is time consuming and tedious to write unit tests, and it is especially difficult to write unit tests that model the pattern of usage of the application they will be used in. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) addresses the problem of separation of concerns in programs which is well suited to unit test problems. What's more, unit tests should be made from different concerns in the application instead of just from functional assertions of correctness or error. In this paper, we firstly present a new concept, application-specific Aspects, which mean top-level aspects picked up from generic low-level aspects in AOP for specific use. It can be viewed as the separation of concerns on applications of generic low-level aspects. Second, this paper describes an Aspect-Oriented Test Description Language (AOTDL) and techniques to build top-level aspects for testing on generic aspects. Third, we generate JUnit unit testing framework and test oracles from AspectJ programs by integrating our tool with AspectJ and JUnit. We use runtime exceptions thrown by testing aspects to decide whether methods work well. Finally, we present a double-phase testing way to filter out meaningless test cases in our framework.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0-7695-2245-9;;;;2004;;;;;;;374;381;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000225885200042;

This task might seem simple for unit tests thanks to two fundamental unit testing guidelines: isolation (unit tests should exercise only a single unit) and separation (they should be placed next to this unit). However, practice shows that recovery may be challenging because the guidelines typically cannot be fully followed. Furthermore, previous works have already demonstrated that fully automatic test-to-code traceability recovery for unit tests is virtually impossible in a general case. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for this task, which is based on computing traceability links using static and dynamic approaches, comparing their results and presenting the discrepancies to the user, who will determine the final traceability links based on the differences and contextual information. We define a set of discrepancy patterns, which can help the user in this task. Additional outcomes of analyzing the discrepancies are structural unit testing issues and related refactoring suggestions. For the static test-to-code traceability, we rely on the physical code structure, while for the dynamic, we use code coverage information. In both cases, we compute combined test and code clusters which represent sets of mutually traceable elements. We also present an empirical study of the method involving 8 non-trivial open source Java systems.;;;;;"Balogh, Gergő/ABA-7560-2021; Gergely, Tamás/ABA-7259-2021; Vancsics, Béla/ABB-3957-2021";"Balogh, Gergő/0000-0002-6781-5453; Gergely, Tamás/0000-0001-7504-3580; Vancsics, Béla/0000-0003-4584-3733; Beszedes, Arpad/0000-0002-5421-9302";;;;;;;;;;;;;0963-9314;1573-1367;;;;JUN;2019;27;2;;;SI;;797;822;;10.1007/s11219-018-9430-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11219-018-9430-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000470767500012;

Many unit test generation tools that can help generate unit test cases with high structural coverage over a program have limn examined. However, the fact that existing test generation tools are mainly evaluated on general software programs calls into question about its practical effectiveness and usefulness for machine learning libraries, which are statistically-orientated and have fundamentally different nature and construction from general software projects. In this paper, we set out to investigate the effectiveness of existing unit test generation techniques on machine learning libraries. To investigate this issue. we conducted an empirical study on five widely-used machine learning libraries with two popular unit test case generation tools. i.e.. EVOSUITE and Randoop. We find that (1) most of themachine learning libraries do not maintain a high-qualify unit test suite regarding commonly applied quality metrics such as code coverage (on average is 34.1%) and mutation score ton average is 21.3%), (2) unit test ease generation tools, i.e., EVOSUITE mid Randoop, lead to clear improvements in code coverage and mutation score. however, the improvement is limited, and (3) there exist common patterns in the uncovered code across the live machine learning libraries that can he used to improve unit test case generation tasks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0270-5257;;978-0-7381-1319-7;;;;2021;;;;;;;1548;1560;;10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00138;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00138;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000684601800125;

System tests are effective at exercising complex usage patterns. Differential unit tests (DUTs) are a hybrid of unit and system tests that exploits their strengths. They are generated by carving the system components, while executing a system test case, that influence the behavior of the target unit and then reassembling those components so that the unit can be exercised as it was by the system test. In this paper, we show that DUTs retain some of the advantages of unit tests, can be automatically generated, and have the potential for revealing faults related to intricate system executions. We present a framework for carving and replaying DUTs that accounts for a wide variety of strategies and trade-offs, we implement an automated instance of the framework with several techniques to mitigate test cost and enhance flexibility and robustness, and we empirically assess the efficacy of carving and replaying DUTs on three software artifacts.;;;;;;Dwyer, Matthew/0000-0002-1937-1544;;;;;;;;;;;;;0098-5589;1939-3520;;;;JAN-FEB;2009;35;1;;;;;29;45;;10.1109/TSE.2008.103;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2008.103;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000265089400002;

Similar to design patterns, patterns for unit testing promote maintainability quality attributes such as ease of diagnoses, modifiability, and comprehension. In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale study on the usage of four xUnit testing patterns which can be used to satisfy these maintainability attributes. This is a first-of-its-kind study which developed automated techniques to investigate these issues across 82,447 open source projects, and the findings provide more insight into testing practices in open source projects. Our results indicate that only 17% of projects had test cases, and from the 251 testing frameworks we studied, 93 of them were being used. We found 24% of projects with test files implemented patterns that could help with maintainability, while the remaining did not use these patterns. Multiple qualitative analyses indicate that usage of patterns was an ad-hoc decision by individual developers, rather than motivated by the characteristics of the project, and that developers sometimes used alternative techniques to address maintainability concerns.;;;;;da Silva Santos, Joanna Cecilia/AAF-7544-2021;da Silva Santos, Joanna Cecilia/0000-0001-8743-2516;;;;;;;;;;;;;2160-1852;;978-1-5386-1544-7;;;;2017;;;;;;;391;401;;10.1109/MSR.2017.8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MSR.2017.8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000425917100040;

However, writing effective unit tests from scratch is difficult and tedious. One way to reduce this difficulty is to recommend existing tests of semantically similar functions. However, modifying the recommended tests manually might still be difficult and tedious. For example, developers have to understand various code elements in the recommended tests to accurately replace them with semantically similar code elements from the target application. One way to mitigate the issue is by developing a test migration or reuse technique that could automatically transform the code elements in the recommended tests and migrate them to the target application. However, to develop such a technique, we first need to identify what types of code transformations are required to successfully migrate the recommended tests. Therefore, in this paper, we first recruit two external participants to create JTESTMIGBENCH, a benchmark of 510 manually migrated JUnit tests for 186 methods from five popular libraries. We then analyze the code changes in the migrated tests to create JTEsTMIGTAx, a taxonomy of test code transformation patterns. Our contributions provide the necessary foundations to develop automated unit test migration or reuse techniques.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1534-5351;;978-1-6654-5278-6;;;;2023;;;;;;;713;717;;10.1109/SANER56733.2023.00077;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SANER56733.2023.00077;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001008282200067;

They can be thought of as certain patterns in software development that are undesirable in comparison to design patterns which are acceptable solutions formalized for a common problem. From the study on anti-pattern classes involved in object-oriented systems, we examined the impact of presence of anti-patterns on the system. There are certain issues with the testing strategies used for finding bugs in the software systems such as objectives of testing, procedure used to test new functions, maximum resources and time needed to execute the project and the environment in which testing needs to be carried out. There is an enormous requirement to carry out testing process in a more suitable way due to the enlarged complications in the development of software systems. Anti-pattern testing is concerned with the reduction of testing cost for different modules. In this paper, we propose a new GUI based testing technique for the identification of anti patterns in object-oriented systems through automation testing.;;;;;;kaur, puneet/0000-0002-5088-1016;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4799-4236-7;;;;2014;;;;;;;779;782;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000357875700139;

The quality assurance can be reached through the testing area, however this area still has challenges and gaps in the SPL development. Since not all testing techniques used in a single product development can be applied to SPL, because of artifacts variabilities, further adaptations and new proposals are required. Our proposal thus is to adapt some unit tests patterns to SPL needs. The Test Automation Framework and Data-Driven Test patterns can provide the reuse of test logic and the automation of implementation mechanisms, reducing the effort required to test the variations of each application. Thus, we propose the Data-Driven Test Automation Framework to be used during the application engineering to configure the tests through Parameterized Tests and verify the correctness of the generated applications.

J;"Wu, JW; Clause, J";;;;"Wu, Jianwei; Clause, James";;;A pattern-based approach to detect and improve non-descriptive test names;JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE;;;;;;;;;;;;Unit tests are an important artifact that supports the software development process in several ways. For example, when a test fails, its name can provide the first step towards understanding the purpose of the test. Unfortunately, unit tests often lack descriptive names. In this paper, we propose a new, pattern-based approach that can help developers improve the quality of test names of JUnit tests by making them more descriptive. It does this by detecting non-descriptive test names and in some cases, providing additional information about how the name can be improved. Our approach was assessed using an empirical evaluation on 34352 JUnit tests. The results of the evaluation show that the approach is feasible, accurate, and useful at discriminating descriptive and non-descriptive names with a 95% true-positive rate. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

These methods can be methods that are not covered by the existing test suite or methods that are poorly tested. We devise an approach called pankti which monitors applications as they execute in production and then automatically generates differential unit tests, as well as derived oracles, from the collected data. pankti's monitoring and generation focuses on one single programming language, Java. We evaluate it on three real-world, open-source projects: a videoconferencing system, a PDF manipulation library, and an e-commerce application. We show that pankti is able to generate differential unit tests by monitoring target methods in production and that the generated tests improve the quality of the test suite of the application under consideration.;;;;;Monperrus, Martin/I-3640-2012;"Monperrus, Martin/0000-0003-3505-3383; Zhang, Long/0000-0002-7211-3894; Tiwari, Deepika/0000-0003-0293-2592; Baudry, Benoit/0000-0002-4015-4640";;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9529;1558-1721;;;;SEP;2022;71;3;;;;;1381;1397;;10.1109/TR.2021.3101318;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TR.2021.3101318;;AUG 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000732651500001;
J;Hamill, P;;;;Hamill, Paul;;;Unit Testing Web Services;DR DOBBS JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;Web services (WS) are becoming a key architectural aspect of large-scale distributed applications. Technology leaders are both launching service-centric applications, such as Google Earth, eBay Web Services, and Amazon's E-Commerce Service, and creating tools that enable other organizations to publish web services. The standards-based, fault-tolerant, self-describing nature of web services enable the creation of loosely coupled applications that run on heterogeneous systems. Web services also enable interoperability between different online applications and enable innovative, synergistic combinations: mashups. While the prime directive for developers once was put it on the Internet, the main goal now is often to make it a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). For Agile developers, following best practices by doing Test-Driven Development (TDD) of WS code can require extra effort, but is definitely feasible. In this article, I present techniques and patterns for unit testing WS applications to enable TDD as well as general-purpose testing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1044-789X;;;;;NOV;2008;33;11;;;;;53;+;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000260058400011;

The primary motivation for this study is to discover the programming strategies used by students for coding exercises with different difficulty levels, and find out if any relation exists between these strategies and the success in solving the coding tasks. More insights into this process will enable educators to provide future students timely, appropriate and constructive feedback on their coding process. Thus, to predict success in the coding exercises, we used indicators from students' testing behaviour reflecting the time and effort differences between two successive unit test runs. The results show a clear difference in the strategies employed by students within different success levels.

We wish to extend the availability of such critique through automation, capturing the essence of interaction between student and instructor as closely as possible. Integrated Development Environments and Automated Grading Systems provide constant feedback through static analysis and unit testing. But we also wish to tailor automated feedback to acknowledge commonly recurring issues with novice programmers, in keeping with the practice of a human instructor. We argue that the kinds of mistakes that novice programmers make, and the way they are reported to the novices, deserve special care. In this paper we provide examples of early programming antipatterns that have arisen from our teaching experience, and describe different ways of identifying and dealing with them automatically through our tool WebTA. Novice students may produce code that is close to a correct solution but contains syntactic errors; WebTA attempts to salvage the promising portions of the student's submission and suggest repairs that are more meaningful than typical compiler error messages. Alternatively, a student misunderstanding may result in well-formed code that passes unit tests yet contains clear design flaws; through additional analysis, WebTA can identify and flag them. Finally, certain types of antipattern can be anticipated and flagged by the instructor, based on the context of the course and the programming exercise; WebTA allows for customizable critique triggers and messages.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-5890-3;;;;2019;;;;;;;738;744;;10.1145/3287324.3287463;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3287324.3287463;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000575321600125;
J;"Demetrescu, M; Hanck, C";;;;"Demetrescu, Matei; Hanck, Christoph";;;Multiple Testing for No Cointegration under Nonstationary Volatility;OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS;;;;;;;;;;;;With cointegration tests often being oversized under time-varying error variance, it is possible, if not likely, to confuse error variance non-stationarity with cointegration. This paper takes an instrumental variable (IV) approach to establish individual-unit test statistics for no cointegration that are robust to variance non-stationarity. The sign of a fitted departure from long-run equilibrium is used as an instrument when estimating an error-correction model. The resulting IV-based test is shown to follow a chi-square limiting null distribution irrespective of the variance pattern of the data-generating process. In spite of this, the test proposed here has, unlike previous work relying on instrumental variables, competitive local power against sequences of local alternatives in 1/T-neighbourhoods of the null. The standard limiting null distribution motivates, using the single-unit tests in a multiple testing approach for cointegration in multi-country data sets by combining P-values from individual units. Simulations suggest good performance of the single-unit and multiple testing procedures under various plausible designs of cross-sectional correlation and cross-unit cointegration in the data. An application to the equilibrium relationship between short- and long-term interest rates illustrates the dramatic differences between results of robust and non-robust tests.;;;;;Demetrescu, Matei/ABD-6488-2021;Demetrescu, Matei/0000-0003-0815-5384;;;;;;;;;;;;;0305-9049;1468-0084;;;;JUN;2018;80;3;;;;;485;513;;10.1111/obes.12214;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obes.12214;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000431669000002;

Furthermore, to help comprehend the test case and troubleshoot issues, developers have the option to provide a message that explains the reason for the assertion failure. In this exploratory empirical study, we examine the characteristics of assertion messages contained in the test methods in 20 open-source Java systems. Our findings show that while developers rarely utilize the option of supplying a message, those who do, either compose it of only string literals, identifiers, or a combination of both types. Using standard English readability measuring techniques, we observe that a beginner's knowledge of English is required to understand messages containing only identifiers, while a 4th-grade education level is required to understand messages composed of string literals. We also discuss shortcomings with using such readability measuring techniques and common anti-patterns in assert message construction.

Objective: The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-practice of quality assurance during the implementation phase in software houses. Method: For this purpose, we conducted a survey in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where 57 software houses participated. The questionnaire comprised questions regarding techniques, tools, and effort for software quality assurance during implementation as well as the perceived quality after implementation. The results were complemented by interviews and results from other surveys on software quality in general. Results: Results from the survey show that the most common software quality assurance techniques used during implementation are unit testing, code reviews and coding guidelines. Most tool support is used in the areas of bug tracking, version control and project management. Due to relationships between the used tool types, it seems that the introduction of one tool leads to the adoption of several others. Also quality assurance techniques and tools are correlated. Bug fixing takes a significant ratio of the overall project effort assigned to implementation. Furthermore, we found that the more developers a software company has, the more effort is spent on bug fixing. Finally, more than half of all companies rated the quality after implementation as rather good to good. Conclusion: For the most important quality assurance techniques and supporting tool types clear usage patterns can be seen and serve as a basis to provide guidelines on their application in practice.;;;;;Felderer, Michael/AAF-4909-2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1865-1348;;"978-3-319-49421-0; 978-3-319-49420-3";;;;2017;269;;;;;;87;102;;10.1007/978-3-319-49421-0_7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49421-0_7;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000399220600007;

Following this pattern in test cases may benefit comprehension, debugging, and maintenance. The AAA structure of real-life test cases may not be explicit due to its high complexity. Manually labeling AAA statements in test cases is tedious. Thus, an automated approach for labeling AAA statements in existing test cases could benefit new developers and projects that practice collective code ownership and test driven development. This study contributes an automatic approach based on machine learning models. The secret sauce of this approach is a set of three learning features that are based on the semantic, syntax, and context information in test cases, derived from the manual tagging process. Thus, our approach mimics how developers may manually tag the AAA pattern of a test case. We assess the precision, recall, and F-1 score of our approach based on 449 test cases, containing about 16,612 statements, across 4 Apache open source projects. For achieving the best performance in our approach, we explore the usage of six machine learning models; the contribution of the SMOTE data balancing technique; the comparison of the three learning features; and the comparison of five different methods for calculating the semantic feature. The results show our approach is able to identify Arrangement, Action, and Assertion statements with a precision upwards of 92%, and recall up to 74%.

J;"Khamis, MA; Nagi, K";;;;"Khamis, Mohamed A.; Nagi, Khaled";;;Designing multi-agent unit tests using systematic test design patterns-(extended version);ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;;;;;;;;;;;;Software agents are the basic building blocks in many software systems especially those based on artificial intelligence methods, e.g., reinforcement learning based multi-agent systems (MASs). However, testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy, distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows MAS developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the JUnit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations.

The development methodology proposed in this paper adapts agile principles and patterns to support the building of embedded control systems, focusing on the issues relating to a system's constraints and safety. Strong unit testing, to ensure correctness, including the satisfaction of timing constraints, is the foundation of the proposed methodology. A platform-based design approach is used to balance costs and time-to-market in relation to performance and functionality constraints. It is concluded that the proposed methodology significantly reduces design time and costs, as well as leading to better software modularity and reliability.;;;;;"Cordeiro, Lucas Carvalho/AAQ-9258-2021; da Silva Barreto, Raimundo/E-7905-2019; Cordeiro, Lucas/IVV-3044-2023; Lucena, Vicente/B-4784-2008";"Cordeiro, Lucas Carvalho/0000-0002-6235-4272; Lucena, Vicente/0000-0001-9864-2850; Barreto, Raimundo/0000-0001-8494-4225";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-0-7695-3141-0;;;;2008;;;;;;;408;417;;10.1109/ECBS.2008.19;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ECBS.2008.19;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000255505000041;

Educators now are assessing tests written by students. Methods have been proposed to assess the completeness of student-written tests. However, there is more to good test quality than completeness, and these additional quality are not assessed by the previous work. Test smells are patterns of poorly designed tests that may negatively affect the quality of test and production code. We propose to assess test smells in students' code to improve the quality of software tests they write. In the early stages of this research, we will examine whether practitioners actually spend time and energy to remove those test smells summarized by researchers backed by real-world software projects.

We report on an extensive study to understand such composite refactoring procedures for the purpose of improving testability. We collected and studied 346,841 java pull requests from 621 GitHub projects. First, we compared the atomic refactorings in two populations: pull requests with changed test-pairs (i.e. with co-changes in production and test code and thus potentially including testability refactoring) and pull requests without test-pairs. We found significantly more atomic refactorings in test-pairs pull requests, such as Change Variable Type Operation or Change Parameter Type. Second, we manually analyzed the code changes of 200 pull requests, where developers explicitly mention the terms testability or refactor + test. We identified ten composite refactoring procedures for the purpose of testability, which we call testability refactoring patterns. Third, we manually analyzed additional 524 test-pairs pull requests: both randomly selected and where we assumed to find testability refactorings, e.g. in pull requests about dependency or concurrency issues. About 25% of all analyzed pull requests actually included testability refactoring patterns. The most frequent were extract a method for override or for invocation, widen access to a method for invocation, and extract a class for invocation. We also report on frequent atomic refactorings which co-occur with the patterns and discuss the implications of our findings for research, practice, and education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0270-5257;;978-1-6654-5701-9;;;;2023;;;;;;;1508;1519;;10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00131;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE48619.2023.00131;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001032629800122;

It specifies a set of valid sequences of operations in a abstract way. When the regular expression is unfold, test sequences are obtained. Usually, the unfolding is done in an exhaustive way, which can result in a combinatorial explosion. In this article, we explore a pairwise coverage criterion to select a subset of test sequences satisfying the pattern, in order to decrease the number of test sequences. The originality of the approach lies in the fact that the pairwise criterion is applied to the instantiated method calls (and not on the parameters). We applied this strategy to generate unit tests for Java classes. The quality of the test suites is evaluated with a mutation analysis and compared to test suites randomly generated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2159-4848;;978-1-5090-3674-5;;;;2016;;;;;;;83;91;;10.1109/ICSTW.2016.23;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICSTW.2016.23;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000382490200014;

The larger vision is the loosely-coupled architecture whose components can be readily expanded or replaced.

Following this pattern in test cases may benefit comprehension, debugging, and maintenance. The AAA structure of real-life test cases, however, may not be clear due to their high complexity. Manually labeling AAA statements in test cases is tedious. Thus, we envision that an automated approach for labeling AAA statements in existing test cases could benefit new developers and projects that practice collective code ownership and test-driven development. This paper contributes an automatic approach based on machine learning models. The secret sauce of this approach is a set of three learning features that are based on the semantic, syntax, and context information in test cases, derived from the manual tagging process. Thus, our approach mimics how developers may manually tag the AAA pattern of a test case. We assess the precision, recall, and F-1 score of our approach based on 449 test cases, containing about 16,612 statements, across 4 Apache open source projects. To achieve the best performance in our approach, we explore the usage of six machine learning models; the contribution of the SMOTE data balancing technique; the comparison of the three learning features; and the comparison of five different methods for calculating the semantic feature. The results show our approach is able to identify Arrangement, Action, and Assertion statements with a precision upwards of 92%, and recall up to 74%. We also summarize some experience based on our experiments-regarding the choice of machine learning models, data balancing algorithm, and feature engineering methods-which could potentially provide some reference to related future research.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0098-5589;1939-3520;;;;MAY 1;2023;49;5;;;;;3305;3324;;10.1109/TSE.2023.3252442;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2023.3252442;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000991628700015;

Educational research has virtually ignored testing as a technique to improve classroom learning. We investigated the testing effect in a college course. Students took weekly quizzes followed by multiple choice criterial tests ( unit tests and a cumulative final). Weekly quizzes included multiple choice or short answer questions, after which feedback was provided. As an exposure control, in some weeks students were presented target material for additional reading. Quizzing, but not additional reading, improved performance on the criterial tests relative to material not targeted by quizzes. Further, short answer quizzes produced more robust benefits than multiple choice quizzes. This pattern converges with laboratory findings showing that recall tests are more beneficial than recognition tests for subsequent memory performance. We conclude that in the classroom testing can be used to promote learning, not just to evaluate learning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0954-1446;;;;;;2007;19;4-5;;;;;494;513;;10.1080/09541440701326154;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09541440701326154;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000249101300002;

Security is a multidisciplinary aspect of the software development lifecycle, operation, and user utilization. Being a complex and specialized area of software engineering, it is often sidestepped in software development methodologies and processes. We address software security at the design level by adopting design patterns that encapsulate reusable solutions for recurring security problems. Design patterns can help development teams implement the best-proven solutions for a specialized problem domain. However, from the analysis of three secure pattern implementations by 70 junior programmers, we detected several structural errors resulting from their interpretation. We propose reusable unit testing test cases based on annotations to avoid secure pattern interpretation errors and provide an example for one popular secure pattern. Providing these test cases to the same group of programmers, they implemented the pattern without errors. The reason is annotations build a framework that disciplines programmers to incorporate secure patterns in their applications and ensure automatic testing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2169-3536;;;;;;2023;11;;;;;;52938;52948;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3279823;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3279823;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001005615300001;

Immanuel;;;Enhanced cross-entropy method for dynamic economic dispatch with valve-point effects;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper proposes an enhanced cross-entropy (ECE) method to solve dynamic economic dispatch (DED) problem with valve-point effects. The cross-entropy (CE) method, originated from an adaptive variance minimization algorithm for estimating probabilities of rare events, is a generic approach to combinatorial and multi-extremal optimization. Exploration capability of CE algorithm is enhanced in this paper by using chaotic sequence and the resultant ECE is applied to DED with valve-point effects. The performance of the proposed ECE method is rigorously tested for optimality, convergence, robustness and computational efficiency on a 10-unit test system. Additional test cases with different load patterns and increased number of generators are also solved by ECE. Numerical results show that the proposed ECE approach finds high-quality solutions reliably with faster convergence. It outperforms CE and all the previous approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we present Corral, a Python framework for astronomical pipeline generation. Corral features a Model-View-Controller design pattern on top of an SQL Relational Database capable of handling: custom data models; processing stages; and communication alerts, and also provides automatic quality and structural metrics based on unit testing. The Model-View-Controller provides concept separation between the user logic and the data models, delivering at the same time multi-processing and distributed computing capabilities. Corral represents an improvement over commonly found data processing pipelines in astronomy since the design pattern eases the programmer from dealing with processing flow and parallelization issues, allowing them to focus on the specific algorithms needed for the successive data transformations and at the same time provides a broad measure of quality over the created pipeline.

In this paper, we propose a design-for-testability method at register transfer level to enable operational units as many as possible to be concurrently tested in scan testing. Using test point insertion and controller augmentation, the proposed design-for-testability method allocates input test registers and an output test register to inputs and an output of each operational unit in a data-path, respectively. Test compaction efficiency becomes high by enabling effective concurrent testing for operational units. Experimental results on high-level benchmark circuits show that our proposed method reduced the number of test patterns by 20% with 63 % area overhead on average.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1942-9398;;978-1-5386-0352-9;;;;2017;;;;;;;17;20;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000427164200006;

It is much simpler than SOAP and WSDL-based services, so many companies have started to use it. This makes the tests carried out on this architecture become more important. Even though there are many tools available, only a few of them can be incorporated to a process of continuous software development, where time is a key factor. In this paper, we present a design pattern for RESTful tests, based on the principles of this architecture and on the unit test basics. The approach has been implemented in three companies of software development as a framework. It has been proved that there has been a 90 % decrease in the time spent during automated regressions and refactoring in a continuous integration environment. Finally, the use of tools to execute automated tests has given rise to other kinds of improvements, such as the automatic generation of reports.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-958-5415-19-5;;;;2018;;;;;;;257;268;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000483360200017;

Despite its popularity, mobile developers are often required to write large and disorganized amounts of code, mixing UI with business logic and interact, in a ad-hoc fashion, with sensor devices and services. These habits hinder the code maintenance, refactoring and testing, while negatively influencing the consistency and performance of mobile applications. In this paper we present Magni as an abstract framework for the design and implementation of personalized and context-aware mobile applications. The corner stone of the framework is its architectural pattern based on the Model-View-Presenter pattern in the UI layer relying in REST services the majority of the app features. This paradigm fosters the modular design, implementing the separation of concerns concept and allowing an easier implementation of unit tests. In order to validate the framework, we present a prototype for an healthcare automotive app. The main goal of the app is to facilitate the access to health related points of interest such as hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.;;;;;"Machado, José/B-5887-2009; Portela, Filipe/G-5324-2012; Queirós, Ricardo F./N-4055-2015";"Machado, José/0000-0003-4121-6169; Portela, Filipe/0000-0003-2181-6837; Queirós, Ricardo F./0000-0003-1780-4753; Queiros, Ricardo/0000-0002-1985-6285";;;;;;;;;;;;;2194-5357;2194-5365;"978-3-319-56541-5; 978-3-319-56540-8";;;;2017;571;;;;;;417;426;;10.1007/978-3-319-56541-5_43;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56541-5_43;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000425539200043;

This has greatly impeded the application of dynamic analysis tools to firmware analysis. The state-of-the-art work automatically models unknown peripherals by observing their access patterns, and then leverages heuristics to calculate the appropriate responses when unknown peripheral registers are accessed. However, we empirically found that this approach and the corresponding heuristics are frequently insufficient to emulate firmware. In this work, we propose a new approach called mu Emu to emulate firmware with unknown peripherals. Unlike existing work that attempts to build a general model for each peripheral, our approach learns how to correctly emulate firmware execution at individual peripheral access points. It takes the image as input and symbolically executes it by representing unknown peripheral registers as symbols. During symbolic execution, it infers the rules to respond to unknown peripheral accesses. These rules are stored in a knowledge base, which is referred to during the dynamic firmware analysis. mu Emu achieved a passing rate of 95% in a set of unit tests for peripheral drivers without any manual assistance. We also evaluated mu Emu with real-world firmware samples and new bugs were discovered.;;;;;"Zhou, Wei/HJP-7784-2023; Liu, Peng/A-4255-2013";"Zhou, Wei/0000-0001-7834-0839;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-939133-24-3;;;;2021;;;;;;;2007;2024;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000722006802012;

The estimated probability that spinning and non-spinning reserves are called and generated is also considered in the formulation to simulate the reserve uncertainty. The artificial neural network (ANN) is applied for forecasting the reserve probability considering line limits, line and generator outages, market prices, bidding strategy, load and reserves patterns. Fuel and emission constraints are included in the model. A hybrid method between Lagrangian relaxation (LR) and evolutionary programming (EP) is applied to solve the proposed GPBUC problem.

The costs in terms of depot repair and user exchange dollars that are wasted annually for unresolved cases are graphically illustrated. A diagnostic data model is presented, which automatically captures, archives and statistically processes test parameters and failure results which are then used to determine if an NFF at the next testing level resulted from a test anomaly. The model includes statistical process methods, which produce historical trend patterns for each part and serial numbered unit tested. An Expert System is used to detect statistical pattern changes and stores that information in a knowledge base.

The experience of a Victorian public health laboratory;AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH;;;;;;;;;;;;From the start of clinical testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody in 1985 until the end of June 1994, the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit tested 134 346 serum samples from 109 391 individuals, identifying 672 as infected. A suitable database, using coded identities, was established from the beginning. Because the sera came from a variety of clinical settings, it was possible to extract information about patterns of requests for tests and about the yield of seropositive cases. The data were able to highlight factors associated with high rates of positive tests that can be lost in amalgamated statewide data. The discovery of HIV-positive females was sporadic and there was a much lower detection rate than from testing males. While males were most commonly diagnosed through specialist venereology services, 61 per cent of diagnoses in females were through nonspecialised practices, often those without previous experience in diagnosis and management of HIV infection. Despite some individual exceptions, the requesting of Hr tests appears generally to have been justifiable (particularly in view of the direction of official preventive campaigns) and not profligate. Overall, where practice was unsatisfactory, this lay less in thoughtless ordering of tests than in failing to include with the specimen the elementary, but vital, epidemiological information requested.;;;;;Thompson, Sandra/H-5955-2014;Thompson, Sandra/0000-0003-0327-7155;;;;;;;;;;;;;1326-0200;;;;;JUN;1996;20;3;;;;;247;253;;10.1111/j.1467-842X.1996.tb01024.x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-842X.1996.tb01024.x;;;;;;;;8768413;;;;;WOS:A1996UY09100007;

While these novel approaches provide new insights into neuroimaging data, they often have unexpected properties, generating a growing literature on possible pitfalls. We propose to meet this challenge by adopting a habit of systematic testing of experimental design, analysis procedures, and statistical inference. Specifically, we suggest to apply the analysis method used for experimental data also to aspects of the experimental design, simulated confounds, simulated null data, and control data. We stress the importance of keeping the analysis method the same in main and test analyses, because only this way possible confounds and unexpected properties can be reliably detected and avoided. We describe and discuss this Same Analysis Approach in detail, and demonstrate it in two worked examples using multivariate decoding. With these examples, we reveal two sources of error: A mismatch between counterbalancing (crossover designs) and cross-validation which leads to systematic below-chance accuracies, and linear decoding of a nonlinear effect, a difference in variance.;;;;;Haynes, John-Dylan/Q-1148-2016;"Haynes, John-Dylan/0000-0003-1786-6954; Hebart, Martin/0000-0001-7257-428X; Gorgen, Kai/0000-0002-4711-9629";;;;;;;;;;;;;1053-8119;1095-9572;;;;OCT 15;2018;180;;A;;;;19;30;;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.083;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.083;;;;;;;;29288130;;;;;WOS:000443268900003;

When developers are asked to reimplement conventional applications to smart contracts, it is thus ideal to automatically transform them, avoiding manual labor, as well as ensuring reliability and security. This paper contributes a set of rules to transform conventional applications in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern into smart contracts running on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain platform preferred by businesses. Major transformations are performed in the model, while in the controller, model calls are replaced by smart contract calls. The source application and the target smart contract are all written in Java. Our rules add read-your-writes consistency that Hyperledger Fabric does not natively support. Runtime pre- and post-condition checking in the original application is supported in the transformed smart contract. We evaluated our rules on CoCoME and other MVC applications, and all code ran correctly and passed unit tests.;;;;;;Ke, Wei/0000-0003-0952-0961;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;979-8-3503-9635-5;;;;2022;;;;;;;104;111;;10.1109/EUC57774.2022.00025;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EUC57774.2022.00025;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000982299100016;

The burning of fossil fuels to meet the industrial electricity demand is leading to deleterious environmental effects. Economic load dispatch (ELD) is an optimization problem that determines an optimum way in terms of cost-effectiveness and emission minimization, for generating power by utilizing the electricity generation resources. Global climatic concerns are driving the researchers to spread the scope of ELD and include unconventional and renewable sources. This research work proposes a combination of three major renewable energy sources with thermal power sources (solar, wind and hydro). The proposed objective function includes a large number of major constraints related to each of the included sources which have not been combined before. The pattern search algorithm has been implemented on IEEE 40 unit test system combining wind, solar and hydro power generating units to observe the results. The results are also compared with the 140 unit Korean power generation model and in addition to several similar systems. Simulation results show that the problem formulation and inclusion of respective constraints bring authenticity to the system and produce accurate results.;;;;;;"kasim, shahreen/0000-0002-4180-4377; Jamaluddin, Mir/0000-0002-7416-8346";;;;;;;;;;;;;1868-5137;1868-5145;;;;2022 FEB 8;2022;;;;;;;;;;10.1007/s12652-021-03691-y;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12652-021-03691-y;;FEB 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000752761000002;

Following the Test Spy design pattern, we can reify such interactions programmatically through additional mutable state. Alternatively, a mocking framework, such as Mockito, can automatically generate test spies that allow us to record the interactions and express our expectations in a declarative domain-specific language. According to our study of the test code for Scala's Iterator trait, the latter approach can lead to a significant reduction of test code complexity in terms of metrics such as code size (in some cases over 70% smaller), cyclomatic complexity, and amount of additional mutable state required. In this tools paper, we argue that the resulting test code is not only more maintainable, readable, and intentional, but also a better stylistic match for the Scala community than manually implemented, explicitly stateful test spies.;;;;;;Laufer, Konstantin/0000-0002-7548-0876;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-6824-7;;;;2019;;;;;;;17;21;;10.1145/3337932.3338814;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3337932.3338814;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000559753800003;

Although the FP units' complex structure consists of classic integer arithmetic components, the embedded components encounter serious testability problems due to their limited accessibility from the FP unit ports and testability loss due to FP unit inherent operations, such as rounding and normalization. In this paper, we analyze the testability problems and present scalable test generation for FP units using as a demonstration vehicle the popular, high-speed, two-path architecture of the most complex unit, the FP adder. The key feature of the presented methodology is the identification of testability conditions that guarantee effective test pattern application and fault propagation for each of the components of the FP adder. The identified test conditions can be utilized with respect to any fault model and are independent of the internal structure and the size of the components. Thus, they can be applied to FP adders of various exponent and significand sizes ( single, double, and custom precision), as well as to other types of FP units, which also consist of classic integer arithmetic components similarly interconnected.;;;;;"PSARAKIS, MIHALIS/AAR-3991-2021; Gizopoulos, Dimitris/ABD-7951-2021";"Gizopoulos, Dimitris/0000-0002-1613-9061; Paschalis, Antonios/0000-0002-6236-4227";;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9340;1557-9956;;;;NOV;2006;55;11;;;;;1449;U24;;10.1109/TC.2006.187;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.187;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000240634900014;

However, principles of unit verification are weakly explored, mostly due to the lack of data, since unit verification data are rarely systematically collected and only a few studies have been published with such data from industry. Therefore, we explore the theory of fault distributions, originating in the quantitative analysis by Fenton and Ohlsson, in the weakly explored context of unit verification in large-scale software development. We conduct a quantitative case study on a sequence of four development projects on consecutive releases of the same complex software product line system for telecommunication exchanges. We replicate the operationalization from earlier studies, analyzed hypotheses related to the Pareto principle of fault distribution, persistence of faults, effects of module size, and quality in terms of fault densities, however, now from the perspective of unit verification. The patterns in unit verification results resemble those of later verification phases, e.g., regarding the Pareto principle, and may thus be used for prediction and planning purposes. Using unit verification results as predictors may improve the quality and efficiency of software verification.;;;;;"Grbac, Tihana Galinac/AAU-8704-2021; Galinac Grbac, Tihana/D-7048-2016; Runeson, Per/H-5113-2019; Grbac, Tihana Galinac/K-2439-2019";"Galinac Grbac, Tihana/0000-0002-4351-4082; Runeson, Per/0000-0003-2795-4851;";;;;;;;;;;;;;0963-9314;1573-1367;;;;DEC;2016;24;4;;;;;967;995;;10.1007/s11219-015-9273-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11219-015-9273-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000388954000006;
J;"Çalikli, G; Bener, AB";;;;"Calikli, Gul; Bener, Ayse Basar";;;Influence of confirmation biases of developers on software quality: an empirical study;SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;The thought processes of people have a significant impact on software quality, as software is designed, developed and tested by people. Cognitive biases, which are defined as patterned deviations of human thought from the laws of logic and mathematics, are a likely cause of software defects. However, there is little empirical evidence to date to substantiate this assertion. In this research, we focus on a specific cognitive bias, confirmation bias, which is defined as the tendency of people to seek evidence that verifies a hypothesis rather than seeking evidence to falsify a hypothesis. Due to this confirmation bias, developers tend to perform unit tests to make their program work rather than to break their code. Therefore, confirmation bias is believed to be one of the factors that lead to an increased software defect density. In this research, we present a metric scheme that explores the impact of developers' confirmation bias on software defect density. In order to estimate the effectiveness of our metric scheme in the quantification of confirmation bias within the context of software development, we performed an empirical study that addressed the prediction of the defective parts of software. In our empirical study, we used confirmation bias metrics on five datasets obtained from two companies. Our results provide empirical evidence that human thought processes and cognitive aspects deserve further investigation to improve decision making in software development for effective process management and resource allocation.;;;;;Basar, Ayse/ABF-9265-2020;"Basar, Ayse/0000-0003-4934-8326; Calikli, Gul/0000-0003-4578-1747";;;;;;;;;;;;;0963-9314;1573-1367;;;;JUN;2013;21;2;;;;;377;416;;10.1007/s11219-012-9180-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11219-012-9180-0;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000316746700007;

The DSL supports interactive prototyping and unit testing, simplifying the process of designing efficient implementations of common patterns. Unscheduled C and scheduled assembly language output are supported. Using the patterns, even nonexpert users can write efficient function implementations, leveraging special hardware features. A production-quality library of elementary functions for the Cell BE SPU compute engines has been developed. Coconut-generated and -scheduled vector functions were more than four times faster than commercially distributed functions written in C with intrinsics (a nicer syntax for in-line assembly), wrapped in loops and scheduled by spuxIc. All Coconut functions were faster, but the difference was larger for hard-to-approximate functions for which register-level SIMD lookups made a bigger difference. Other helpful features in the language include facilities for translating interval and polynomial descriptions between GHCi, a Haskell interpreter used to prototype in the DSL, and Maple, used for exploration and minimax polynomial generation. This makes it easier to match mathematical properties of the functions with efficient calculational patterns in the SPU ISA. By using single, literate source files, the resulting functions are remarkably readable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9340;1557-9956;;;;AUG;2009;58;8;;;;;1126;1138;;10.1109/TC.2008.223;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.223;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000267941900009;

There are several ODP repositories where ODPs are shared as well as ontology design methodologies recommending their reuse. Performing rigorous testing is recommended as well for supporting ontology maintenance and validating the resulting resource against its motivating requirements. Nevertheless, it is less than straightforward to find guidelines on how to apply such methodologies for developing domain-specific knowledge graphs. ArCo is the knowledge graph of Italian Cultural Heritage and has been developed by using eXtreme Design (XD), an ODP- and test-driven methodology. During its development, XD has been adapted to the need of the CH domain e.g. gathering requirements from an open, diverse community of consumers, a new ODP has been defined and many have been specialised to address specific CH requirements. This paper presents ArCo and describes how to apply XD to the development and validation of a CH knowledge graph, also detailing the (intellectual) process implemented for matching the encountered modelling problems to ODPs.

Figuring out the convergence and persistence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions matters much for environmental policymakers in China. This study mainly utilizes the Fourier quantile unit root test to survey the convergence of the SO2 emissions per capita in 74 cities of China during the period of December 2014 to June 2019, by conducting five traditional unit root tests and a quantile root unit test as a comparative analysis. The empirical results indicate that the SO2 emissions per capita in 72 out of 74 cities in China are convergent in the sample period. The results also suggest that the unit root behavior of the SO2 emissions per capita in these cities is asymmetrically persistent at different quantiles. For the cities with the convergent SO2 emissions, the government should consider the asymmetric mean-reverting pattern of SO2 emissions when implementing environmental protection policies at different stages. For Hefei and Nanjing, the local governments need to enact stricter environmental protection policies to control the emission of sulfur dioxide.;;;;;"Zhang, Yuchen/GYI-8858-2022; zhang, yu/HNS-5948-2023";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2071-1050;;;;MAR 1;2020;12;5;;;;;;;1781;10.3390/su12051781;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12051781;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000522470900082;

Parameters of those models can be interdependent and also dependent on the momentum transfer vector Q. Here we present a modern data analysis interface dedicated for QENS data analysis implemented within the open source software Mantid. The interface has been implemented using the state-of-the-art design pattern ModelView-Presenter (MVP). The MVP, an architectural software design pattern, facilitates automated unit tests as well as decoupling of the business logic, presentation logic and the graphical interface. Several models are implemented for analysing both elastic and quasi-elastic parts of the dynamical scattering function S(Q,omega) and intermediate scattering function I(Q, t). To understand the nature of dynamics in a QENS experiments, several models are also implemented for elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF) and jump diffusions. The interface has been validated by analysing a sample of liquid water at room temperature. The nature of hydrogen bond dynamics of the hydrogen bonded organic ferroelectric 2, 4, 5 - Br-3 imidazole, for the first time has been analysed using this newly implemented software.

Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit tests, perform static code analysis, or inspect run-time memory use are crucial in the software development life cycle. More sophisticated methods allow for performing meta-analyses of large software repositories, e.g., to discover abstract topics they relate to or common design patterns applied by their developers. They may be useful in gaining a better understanding of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as detecting plagiarism in programming classes. A meaningful measure of similarity of computer programs often forms the basis of such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments for similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable for analysing R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather simple techniques and heuristics and fail to provide a user with the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for working with R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR package. It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but also for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked by applying some obfuscation techniques or imputing dead code.

Furthermore, the study described ordering patterns to investigate the benefit of repeated testing. METHODS: Test result, requisitioning unit, test date and the patient's social security number were collected from the Department of Clinical Immunology at Odense University Hospital in 2007-2016 and merged with patient diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry. RESULTS: Overall, 5% were diagnosed with RA. IgM RF remained the preferred test during the entire period. Test sensitivity was 61% for IgM RF and 54% for ACPA. The test specificity was 88% for IgM RF and 96% for ACPA. PPV was higher for ACPA than for IgM RF (30% versus 12%) and NPV was equal (99%) in primary care. Few individuals seroconverted from negative to positive (ACPA 2% and IgM RF 5%) and positive to negative (ACPA 3% and IgM RF 6%).

Performance engineering methods may be integrated into all phases of the software lifecycle, from the conception of a system to requirements specification, architecture, testing, and finally to production. Performance expectations can be managed by carefully specifying performance requirements. Reviewing the architecture of a system before design and implementation take place reduces the risk of designing a system that contains inherent performance vice. Performance modeling can be used to justify architectural and design decisions and to plan performance tests. The outputs of such performance tests enable us able to identify concurrent programming and other issues that would not be apparent in unit testing.

High performance computing (HPC) applications and libraries must exploit increasingly finer levels of parallelism within their codes to sustain scalability on these devices. A major obstacle to performance portability is the diverse and conflicting set of constraints on memory access patterns across devices. Contemporary portable programming models address manycore parallelism (e.g., OpenMP, OpenACC, OpenCL) but fail to address memory access patterns. The Kokkos C++ library enables applications and domain libraries to achieve performance portability on diverse manycore architectures by unifying abstractions for both fine-grain data parallelism and memory access patterns. In this paper we describe Kokkos' abstractions, summarize its application programmer interface (API), present performance results for unit-test kernels and mini-applications, and outline an incremental strategy for migrating legacy C++ codes to Kokkos. The Kokkos library is under active research and development to incorporate capabilities from new generations of manycore architectures, and to address a growing list of applications and domain libraries.

However, little research has been done on different learners' group behavior characteristics, such as which indicators can reflect learner groups' behavior, and what are the typical behavior characteristics of different learner groups. In this work, we established a Python Language Foundation self-built SPOC course, and 109 undergraduates' learning behavior data were collected and analyzed. From 74-dimensional behavior log data consisting of 72 video-viewing, course video score, and comprehensive score, Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce dimensionality. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to divide learners into different categories, and the results showed that 15 groups are clustered. According to the analysis of the four indicators for group characteristics, which are the completion and viewing-stability of task-point videos, unit test excellence, and comprehensive score, it is identified into five primary types, including positive type, regular type, negative type, semi-negative type, and a fluctuation type. Experiments conducted on a real data set across different academic years and courses show that the proposed approach has better clustering accuracy and practicability. It is expected that this work may be used to strengthen the personalized learning support services system in educational institutions and develop a tool that integrates exploration and analysis work onto the web platform.;;;;;"Wang, Zhibao/GLT-5260-2022; Lu, Yang/B-3068-2016";"Lu, Yang/0000-0001-9887-7078; Bai, Lu/0000-0003-1242-5412";;;;;;;;;;;;;1061-3773;1099-0542;;;;JUL;2023;31;4;;;;;1059;1077;;10.1002/cae.22624;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cae.22624;;MAR 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000950286500001;

Our findings, which largely generalized across the studied IDEs and programming languages Java and C#, question several commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about developer testing: half of the developers in our study do not test; developers rarely run their tests in the IDE; most programming sessions end without any test execution; only once they start testing, do they do it extensively; a quarter of test cases is responsible for three quarters of all test failures; 12 percent of tests show flaky behavior; Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not widely practiced; and software developers only spend a quarter of their time engineering tests, whereas they think they test half of their time.

J;"Choi, KY; Lee, JW";;;;"Choi, Ki-Yong; Lee, Jung-Won";;;CNN-Based Fault Localization Method Using Memory-Updated Patterns for Integration Test in an HiL Environment;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;;;;;;;;;;;;Automotive electronic components are tested via hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing at the unit and integration test stages, according to ISO 26262. It is difficult to obtain debugging information from the HiL test because the simulator runs a black-box test automatically, depending on the scenario in the test script. At this time, debugging information can be obtained in HiL tests, using memory-updated information, without the source code or the debugging tool. However, this method does not know when the fault occurred, and it is difficult to select the starting point of debugging if the execution flow of the software is not known. In this paper, we propose a fault-localization method using a pattern in which each memory address is updated in the HiL test. Via a sequential pattern-mining algorithm in the memory-updated information of the transferred unit tests, memory-updated patterns are extracted, and the system learns using a convolutional neural network. Applying the learned pattern in the memory-updated information of the integration test can determine the fault point from the normal pattern. The point of departure from the normal pattern is highlighted as a fault-occurrence time, and updated addresses are presented as fault candidates. We applied the proposed method to an HiL test of an OSEK/VDX-based electronic control unit. Through fault-injection testing, we could find the cause of faults by checking the average memory address of 3.28%, and we could present the point of fault occurrence with an average accuracy of 80%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2076-3417;;;;JUL 2;2019;9;14;;;;;;;2799;10.3390/app9142799;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9142799;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000479026900027;

In the course unit, student teams were asked to make changes to a large open source software system, and to maintain clean release builds as they did so. Release build health (in terms of compiling code and passing unit tests) was explicitly included in the marking scheme for the coursework. We set up a continuous integration server to keep track of student build health. Initially, this was used only by TAs in marking student work, but for later cohorts we provided access to continuous integration results to all students from the early stages of each exercise. This has provided us with data on the changing patterns of student build health, with differing access to the CI server, giving an insight into how students learn to manage build health and the effects of allowing them access to CI results. We found evidence of a clear improvement in ability to manage build health when CI facilities are made available, but that some student teams were not making use of the facilities to much effect. The improvement effect was strongest on the build health of release builds, corresponding to the area of greatest marks in the marking scheme. The CI results also proved to be very valuable for academic staff, in making the problems with student builds visible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-06019-0; 978-3-030-06018-3";;;;2019;11350;;;;;;169;183;;10.1007/978-3-030-06019-0_13;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-06019-0_13;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000612998000013;

An empirical study on refactoring trends and topics in Stack Overflow;EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING;;;;;;;;;;;;An essential part of software maintenance and evolution, refactoring is performed by developers, regardless of technology or domain, to improve the internal quality of the system, and reduce its technical debt. However, choosing the appropriate refactoring strategy is not always straightforward, resulting in developers seeking assistance. Although research in refactoring is well-established, with several studies altering between the detection of refactoring opportunities and the recommendation of appropriate code changes, little is known about their adoption in practice. Analyzing the perception of developers is critical to understand better what developers consider to be problematic in their code and how they handle it. Additionally, there is a need for bridging the gap between refactoring, as research, and its adoption in practice, by extracting common refactoring intents that are more suitable for what developers face in reality. In this study, we analyze refactoring discussions on Stack Overflow through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our results show that Stack Overflow is utilized by a diverse set of developers for refactoring assistance for a variety of technologies. Our observations show five areas that developers typically require help with refactoring- Code Optimization, Tools and IDEs, Architecture and Design Patterns, Unit Testing, and Database. We envision our findings better bridge the support between traditional (or academic) aspects of refactoring and their real-world applicability, including better tool support.;;;;;"Mkaouer, Mohamed Wiem/N-7476-2017; AlOmar, Eman/ABW-2622-2022";"Mkaouer, Mohamed Wiem/0000-0001-6010-7561; AlOmar, Eman/0000-0003-1800-9268; Ouni, Ali/0000-0003-4708-0362; Simmons, Steven/0000-0003-3081-8500; Peruma, Anthony/0000-0003-2585-657X; Newman, Christian/0000-0002-8838-4074";;;;;;;;;;;;;1382-3256;1573-7616;;;;JAN;2022;27;1;;;;;;;11;10.1007/s10664-021-10045-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10664-021-10045-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000710216100003;

Previous research has found that concurrency faults are hard to avoid, hard to find, often leading to undesired and unpredictable behavior. Further, with the growing availability of multi-core devices and adaptation of concurrency features in high-level languages, concurrency faults occur reportedly often, which is why countermeasures must be investigated to limit harm. Reactive programming provides an abstraction to simplify complex concurrent and asynchronous tasks through reactive language extensions such as the RxJava and Project Reactor libraries for Java. Still, blocking violations are possibly resulting in concurrency faults with no Java compiler warnings. BlockHound is a tool that detects incorrect blocking by wrapping the original code and intercepting blocking calls to provide appropriate runtime errors. In this study, we seek an understanding of how common blocking violations are and whether a tool such as BlockHound can give us insight into the root-causes to highlight them as pitfalls to developers. The investigated Softwares are Java-based open-source projects using reactive frameworks selected based on high star ratings and large fork quantities that indicate high adoption. We activated BlockHound in the project's test-suites and analyzed log files for common patterns to reveal blocking violations in 7/29 investigated open-source projects with 5024 stars and 1437 forks. A small number of system calls could be identified as root-causes. We here present countermeasures that successfully removed the uncertainty of blocking violations.

One relevant avenue of research is the transformation of software designs in order to increase efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Design Patterns are of interest here as the indirection they introduce is likely to have a detrimental effect on energy consumption. In this paper we report on our investigations into the impact on energy consumption of the Decorator pattern, which is a structural design pattern used to enable additional behaviour to be attached to an individual component dynamically. Application of this pattern improves the maintainability of software at the cost of increased indirection and redundancy, which may reduce energy efficiency. In this paper we explore features of the Decorator pattern that impact on its systematic removal, with a future goal of removing this pattern using automated refactoring. We subsequently examine experimentally the Decorator pattern's impact on energy consumption in Java and find its implementation results in an increased number of instantiated objects and method invocations at run-time. The removal of the pattern can result in up to a 96% reduction in energy consumption in a best-case scenario with a textbook example, and up to a 5% reduction in energy consumption in an open-source project with a case study examining JUnit, a popular unit testing framework for Java. These results demonstrate the energy savings achievable with the removal of Decorator pattern instances and open the way for similar investigations of other design patterns.;;;;;;Connolly Bree, Deaglan/0000-0001-9038-2134;;;;;;;;;;;;;1944-2793;;978-1-6654-3786-8;;;;2022;;;;;;;902;912;;10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00108;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00108;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000855050800096;

Objective: Leveraging this pattern, we implemented a prototype tool, Test Suite Evolver (TSE), to support the generation of test cases for structurally similar methods. Our prototype tool is applicable to both, incomplete test suites with the purpose of test case augmentation, as well as evolving test suites when a newer version of a software becomes available. Method: Making use of the aforementioned code-test co-evolution pattern, TSE leverages source code structural similarity and a set of existing test cases to synthesise and recommend new unit tests. For this, TSE initially identifies groups of structurally similar methods in the code, determines changes at the token-level, and integrates the retrieved information to synthesise updated test cases. Results: Our evaluations indicated that 38% of the source code of five large open-source applications consist of methods which are structurally similar to each other and therefore for which, the co-evolution pattern holds. Applying TSE to these methods, TSE generated 72% of the minimum required test cases with only 11% token-based edit distance between the generated test cases and those written by developers. To evaluate the test cases' validity, we used code2vec, a neural network to measure the structural and semantic similarity between the generated and developed test cases. The results indicated that TSE successfully generated test cases with a similarity measure of more than 80% in more than 95.6% of test cases and similarity measure of 100% for 88.35% of the test cases. Conclusion: The evaluations revealed that TSE is able to generate the majority of the necessary test cases with an insignificant amount of modifications required from the developers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-9286-0;;;;2022;;;;;;;65;76;;10.1145/3524481.3527222;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3524481.3527222;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000850254300008;

However, related work has shown that generated tests with high code coverage could be ineffective, i.e., they may not detect all faults or kill all injected mutants. In this paper, we propose Cling, an integration-level test case generation approach that exploits how a pair of classes, the caller and the callee, interact with each other through method calls. In particular, Cling generates integration-level test cases that maximize the Coupled Branches Criterion (CBC). Coupled branches are pairs of branches containing a branch of the caller and a branch of the callee such that an integration test that exercises the former also exercises the latter. CBC is a novel integration-level coverage criterion, measuring the degree to which a test suite exercises the interactions between a caller and its callee classes. We implemented Cling and evaluated the approach on 140 pairs of classes from five different open-source Java projects. Our results show that (1) Cling generates test suites with high CBC coverage, thanks to the definition of the test suite generation as a many-objectives problem where each couple of branches is an independent objective; (2) such generated suites trigger different class interactions and can kill on average 7.7% (with a maximum of 50%) of mutants that are not detected by tests generated randomly or at the unit level; (3) Cling can detect integration faults coming from wrong assumptions about the usage of the callee class (25 for our subject systems) that remain undetected when using automatically generated random and unit-level test suites.";;;;;"Zaidman, Andy/O-6542-2014; van Deursen, Arie/G-3084-2011";"Zaidman, Andy/0000-0003-2413-3935; van Deursen, Arie/0000-0003-4850-3312; Derakhshanfar, Pouria/0000-0003-3549-9019";;;;;;;;;;;;;0098-5589;1939-3520;;;;APR 1;2023;49;4;;;;;2069;2087;;10.1109/TSE.2022.3209625;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2022.3209625;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000978723600037;
J;"Mattiello, GR; Endo, AT";;;;"Mattiello, Guilherme Ricken; Endo, Andre Takeshi";;;Model-based testing leveraged for automated web tests;SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL;;;;;;;;;;;;Agile methods and their practices have fostered the widespread presence of automated test cases. Such test cases have been successfully and extensively adopted to test different software levels, from unit tests (e.g., JUnit) to end-to-end Web Graphical User Interface (GUI) tests (e.g., Selenium Webdriver). While test execution is mostly automated by existing tools, test design remains a manual task. In the pursuit of a more automated test case generation approach, the use of models has been advocated by the model-based testing (MBT) technique. Current MBT approaches assume a top-down workflow in which testers design models, test cases are generated from models, and then scripts are written to automate test execution. Nevertheless, writing automated tests is nowadays a developer's responsibility and testers face a scenario in which automated tests might be reused to produce new model-based tests. This paper aimed to improve the synergy between existing automated tests and MBT. To do so, we present an approach that infers a model from existing tests, a tester leverages this model to include new tests, and then test code is generated. We analyzed the proposed approach in the context of Web applications with system-level GUI tests that employ the Page Object pattern. For MBT, we adopted event-driven models augmented with parameters and test input data. We evaluated the approach's applicability with a prototype tool called MoLeWe and an experimental study with nine open-source Web applications. The results provide some evidence that using MoLeWe may help to include new tests faster than manually coding them, while increasing the overall code coverage of the test suite.;;;;;Endo, Andre Takeshi/I-1861-2012;Endo, Andre Takeshi/0000-0002-8737-1749;;;;;;;;;;;;;0963-9314;1573-1367;;;;SEP;2022;30;3;;;;;621;649;;10.1007/s11219-021-09575-w;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11219-021-09575-w;;NOV 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000722964800001;

In recent years, attention has been focused on identifying student subgroups with different patterns of online SRL behaviors and comparing their learning performance. However, there is limited research leveraging traces of SRL behaviors to detect student subgroups and examine the subgroup differences in cognitive load and student engagement. The current study tracked the engagement of 101 graduate students with SRL-enabling tools integrated into an asynchronous online course. According to the recorded SRL behaviors, this study identified two distinct student subgroups, using sequence analysis and cluster analysis: high SRL (H-SRL) and low SRL (L-SRL) groups. The H-SRL group showed lower extraneous cognitive load and higher learning performance, germane cognitive load, and cognitive engagement than the L-SRL group did. Additionally, this study articulated and compared temporal patterns of online SRL behaviors between the student subgroups combining lag sequential analysis and epistemic network analysis. The results revealed that both groups followed three phases of self-regulation but performed off-task behaviors. Additionally, the H-SRL group preferred activating mastery learning goals to improve ethical knowledge, whereas the L-SRL group preferred choosing performance-avoidance learning goals to pass the unit tests. The H-SRL group invested more in time management and notetaking, whereas the L-SRL group engaged more in surface learning approaches. This study offers researchers both theoretical and methodological insights.

The internal quality is typically enforced through testing, which in turn also affects the development and maintenance costs. This is the reason why testing methodologies have become a major concern for any company that builds - or is involved in building - software. Although there is no testing approach that suits all contexts, we infer some general guidelines learned during the Development of the Italian Single-dish COntrol System (DISCOS), which is a project aimed at producing the control software for the three INAF radio telescopes (the Medicina and Noto dishes, and the newly-built SRT). These guidelines concern both the development and the maintenance phases, and their ultimate goal is to maximize the DISCOS software quality through a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) workflow beside a continuous delivery pipeline. We consider different topics and patterns; they involve the proper apportion of the tests (from end-to-end to low-level tests), the choice between hardware simulators and mockers, why and how to apply TDD and the dependency injection to increase the test coverage, the emerging technologies available for test isolation, bug fixing, how to protect the system from the external resources changes (firmware updating, hardware substitution, etc.) and, eventually, how to accomplish BDD starting from functional tests and going through integration and unit tests.

One way of issuing such alerts is to create an application-agnostic cyber-attack detection system that responds to prevalent software vulnerabilities. The creation of such an autonomic alert system, however, is impeded by the disparity between implementation language, function, Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements, and architectural patterns present in applications, all of which contribute to the rapidly changing threat landscape presented by modern heterogeneous software systems. This paper evaluates the feasibility of creating an autonomic cyber-attack detection system and applying it to several exemplar web-based applications using program transformation and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we examine whether it is possible to detect cyber-attacks (1) online, i.e., as they occur using lightweight structures derived from a call graph and (2) offline, i.e., using machine learning techniques trained with features extracted from a trace of application execution. In both cases, we first characterize normal application behavior using supervised training with the test suites created for an application as part of the software development process. We then intentionally perturb our test applications so they are vulnerable to common attack vectors and then evaluate the effectiveness of various feature extraction and learning strategies on the perturbed applications. Our results show that both lightweight on-line models based on control flow of execution path and application specific off-line models can successfully and efficiently detect in-process cyber-attacks against web applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2475-6113;;978-1-5386-2201-8;;;;2017;;;;;;;407;414;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000414302500067;

Designs are required to pass sign-off design rule check (DRC) before tape-out. Foundries rely on DRC to ensure designs they accept are manufacturable. DRC runsets must be accurate, complete, and reliable. DRC runset qualification is critical in technology node deployment and maturation. The number, complexity and variation of design rules grow dramatically with advancing technology nodes. This increases the QA challenge to ensure quality and accuracy of runsets and their interdependent rule operations. Traditional methods of migrating previous node QA patterns, manually crafting new testcases, and targeted-pattern generation leave gaps in advanced process node qualification coverage. We deploy a novel synthetic layout generation approach to produce large varieties of complex layouts with high design space coverage to thoroughly qualify runsets, make runset improvements and release quality PDKs. We employ guided random Monte Carlo layout generation with user-defined layout construction rules. User-defined rules inform DRC requirements and assign weighted priorities to guide layout design styles. We generate stress DR layouts and high pattern coverage, with DRC-clean patterns and with deliberate DRC violations, to validate expected DRC results and exercise entire rule decks. In this paper, we show how Synthetic Layout Generation is integrated into runset QA flows, automatically generating stress DR conditions that manual efforts often miss, expand layout pattern space coverage, and improve runset execution coverage leading to higher quality on-time PDK development, qualification, and release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;1996-756X;"978-1-5106-4980-4; 978-1-5106-4979-8";;;;2022;12052;;;;;;;;120520L;10.1117/12.2614085;http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2614085;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000844431900015;

The controller gains are optimized by an Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO) method. The improvement inGWOmethod is done by an approach which does not consider less important delta wolves for updating the position vector in the hunting stages of the algorithm thus making the algorithm simpler with less implementation time. Proposed IGWO is initially evaluated using some standard test functions. The outcomes are equated with GWO, modified GWO (MGWO), Differential Evolution (DE), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques to illustrate its supremacy. The IGWO algorithm is then employed to optimize PID, hybridized structure of Fuzzy PD and cascade PI-PD(FPD/PI-PD) and fuzzy based PID parameters for frequency regulation of two-area power system. The superiority of fuzzy PID is established over recently proposed Automatic Generation Control (AGC) approaches. In the second stage, the methodology is applied to a two-area six-unit test system with diverse sources and supremacy of the proposed approach is established over optimal feedback controller, DE tuned PID and TLBO tuned 2DOF PID for the same test system. Finally, the suggested technique is used in a three area nonlinear test system and the supremacy of suggested approach over IGWO tuned FPD/PI-PD and hybrid Firefly Algorithm-Pattern Search (hFA-PS) tuned fuzzy PID is shown. Sensitivity study is conducted to show the ability of the suggested approach to perform satisfactorily with varied conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;;;;;Sahoo, Biswa P.

Whilst it is effective in promoting and rewarding deep approaches to learning in some settings, we hypothesised that implementation of the curriculum (design and assessment) may impact on students' preparation for the PT and their learning. Aim To compare students' perceptions of and preparations for the PT at two medical schools. Method Focus groups were used to generate items for a questionnaire. This was piloted, refined, and then delivered at both schools. Exploratory factor analysis identified the main factors underpinning response patterns. ANOVA was used to compare differences in response by school, year group and gender. Results Response rates were 640 (57%) and 414 (47%) at Schools A and B, respectively. Three major factors were identified: the PT's ability to (1) assess academic learning (2) support clinical learning; (3) the PT's impact on exam preparation. Significant differences were found between settings. In the school with early clinical contact, more frequent PTs and no end of unit tests, students were more likely to appreciate the PT as a support for learning, perceive it as fair and valid, and use a deeper approach to learning-but they also spent longer preparing for the test. Conclusion Different approaches to the delivery of the PT can impact significantly on student study patterns. The learning environment has an important impact on student perceptions of assessment and approach to learning. Careful decisions about PT deployment must be taken to ensure its optimal impact.";;;;;;Mattick, Karen/0000-0003-1800-773X;;;;;;;;;;;;;1382-4996;;;;;OCT;2012;17;4;;;;;573;583;;10.1007/s10459-011-9334-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10459-011-9334-z;;;;;;;;22041871;;;;;WOS:000308356700010;

The Markovian view of the testing process relates unit quality and test quality to the expected unit/system quality, and to the expected number of tests. The model is based on replicating testing where the test is replicated only after a fail test outcome. A set of equations are generalized for many component systems. The study enables the costs and associated benefits for particular groups of components to be considered for module testing at different levels of system hierarchy. Simulation results show that the selection of an appropriate testing architecture and modular architecture can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of system testing. The model is applied to several testing architectures and test patterns to illustrate the tradeoff comparisons that can be made between different system architectures in terms of the overall test cost and the resulting system quality. Several heuristics are derived to assist in planning tests of complex systems for optimizing quality and cost before systems are built. This Markovian model of testability in systems shows promise for use from the modular unit build-level in engineering manufacture development through to strategizing portfolio-level integration and information assurance testing of new capability projects with legacy systems in a family-of-systems. The early abstract testability work reinforces the benefits of iterating testing as early and often as possible. Following trials to validate the model in different contexts and to refine the interface with systems engineers, this testability model could be added to other design for six-sigma tools and techniques to better enable systems engineering practitioners to tradeoff on testability options well before testing starts.;;;;;;"Joiner, Keith/0000-0001-6081-3239; Efatmaneshnik, Mahmoud/0000-0002-0253-938X; Shoval, Shraga/0000-0002-0582-4821";;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-8184;1937-9234;;;;DEC;2019;13;4;;;;;3651;3662;;10.1109/JSYST.2019.2899697;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2019.2899697;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000503182300006;

The technique takes a program or software component, plus a set of correct executions-say, from observations of the software running properly, or from an existing test suite that a user wishes to enhance. The technique first infers an operational model of the software's operation. Then, inputs whose operational pattern of execution differs from the model in specific ways are suggestive of faults. These inputs are further reduced by selecting only one input per operational pattern. The result is a small portion of the original inputs, deemed by the technique as most likely to reveal faults. Thus, the technique can also be seen as an error-detection technique. The paper describes two additional techniques that complement test input selection. One is a technique for automatically producing an oracle (a set of assertions) for a test input from the operational model, thus transforming the test input into a test case. The other is a classification-guided test input generation technique that also makes use of operational models and patterns. When generating inputs, it filters out code sequences that are unlikely to contribute to legal inputs, improving the efficiency of its search for fault-revealing inputs. We have implemented these techniques in the Eclat tool, which generates unit tests for Java classes. Eclat's input is a set of classes to test and an example program execution-say, a passing test suite. Eclat's output is a set of JUnit test cases, each containing a potentially fault-revealing input and a set of assertions at least one of which fails. In our experiments, Eclat successfully generated inputs that exposed fault-revealing behavior; we have used Eclat to reveal real errors in programs. The inputs it selects as fault-revealing are an order of magnitude as likely to reveal a fault as all generated inputs.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0302-9743;1611-3349;3-540-27992-X;;;;2005;3586;;;;;;504;527;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000231116400022;

The spike rates to the masker and signal + masker were compared to quantify masking at different interaural time delays of the noise. The signal was a 50-ms tone burst at best frequency or a 50-ms segment of a synthetic vowel, presented at the best interaural delay of the unit tested. At each noise masker delay, the noise level was adjusted to obtain a criterion spike difference. In most cases, the level required was lowest at the best delay for the noise. The mean difference between maximum and minimum masked thresholds across the cell population was very similar to the human psychophysical masking level difference under the same signal and masker conditions. In another series of tests, we measured the effect of the noise masker on the temporal pattern of the discharge to the signal. The signal used was a 500-ms segment of the synthetic vowel. In virtually all cases the addition of a continuous noise masker reduced the discharge rate synchronized to the fundamental frequency of the vowel. The degree of this reduction was dependent on the interaural time delay of the noise masker. For most units, maximum reduction was seen when the vowel and noise had the same interaural time delay. The similarity between the masking which we have shown physiologically and that reported in a variety of human psychophysical experiments suggests that the processing at levels up to and including the inferior colliculus contributes to the psychophysical BMLD.;;;;;Rees, Adrian/H-2200-2012;"Rees, Adrian/0000-0003-3313-8375; Palmer, Alan/0000-0001-5893-4525";;;;;;;;;;;;;0378-5955;1878-5891;;;;DEC;1991;57;1;;;;;91;106;;10.1016/0378-5955(91)90078-N;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-5955(91)90078-N;;;;;;;;1774216;;;;;WOS:A1991GV06500011;

We describe an algorithm for taking time-synchronized samples of single-phase voltage and current power signals and calculating their dynamic parameters, in particular the signal magnitude, phase, frequency, and rate of change of frequency that a PMU reports. PMUs must time stamp their values at periodic Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) markers called the update times. Thus, to provide a reference for PMU testing the sampled data can be fit to a model to define the value of a dynamic parameter at a specific time. The analysis model proposed in this paper assumes that the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters of the signals are constant over the sampling interval analyzed. This analysis interval is usually the same as the update period or an integer multiple of that period. In the proposed analysis model the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters are considered a polynomial in time about the update times. The order of the polynomial can be adjusted in a way that meets the needs of the signal being analyzed, yet minimizes the computational effort and sensitivity to noise. We show that when the dynamic variations are analyzed in this way, a single matrix can be used to iteratively converge on a good estimate of the dynamic frequency and magnitude parameters. The polynomial model can be used to generate and analyze test signals. Several test patterns are proposed, which include linearly changing magnitudes or frequencies. As expected, during low voltage tests of the system, the analysis does very well when the generation model matches the analysis model. Several other generation models are also proposed, such as sine waves or damped sine waves. The proposed analysis model is shown to be very accurate in these cases as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-5517;;978-1-4244-1296-9;;;;2007;;;;;;;4058;+;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000251345404014;

Deprecation is commonly used as a tool to manage multiple versions of methods or services. However, deprecation carries a cost in that tests might be duplicated and might rely on services that have become deprecated over time. Objective Using the terms of the Technical Debt metaphor, we explore the consequences of deprecation, and how it has affected the test base during seven years. Method We take an exploratory approach, reporting on experiences found before and after servicing parts of the incurred Technical Debt. We mine code repositories and validate our findings with experienced developers. Results We found that the growth of deprecation debt varied a lot. Some services experienced substantial growth, but most did not. Unit tests, where deprecation is visible in the developers' tools, were much less affected than integration tests, which lack such visualization mechanisms. While servicing debt of 121 out of 285 deprecated services, we discovered that up to 29% of the spent effort could be attributed to accrued interest. However, this is an upper bound; there could be less impact, depending on whether scripting could be used to service the debt or not. Conclusion This paper illustrates that integration tests can be viewed as a debt from the perspective of deprecated services. While the pattern was that deprecated services (debt principal) experienced no or little accrued interest, some, highly used, services experienced a lot, particularly during stressful times. Java-based tests, where deprecation is visible in the IDE, did not experience a similar pattern of increasing debt. We postulate that deprecation debt should be kept visible, either using developer tools or statistical reports.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4503-7960-1;;;;2020;;;;;;;67;76;;10.1145/3387906.3388629;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3387906.3388629;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001048482100008;

To assess how muscle ischaemia and isometric fatiguing contraction influence oxygen content in striated muscle. Methods. We simultaneously measured changes in hemoglobin near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and in surface EMG before, during, and after muscle ischaemia and ischaemia plus muscle isometric fatiguing contraction, Seventeen healthy male subjects (age range: 19-40 yrs) were examined in our Clinical Neurophysiology Unit. Test I (9 subjects): hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy and stimulated surface EMG were measured for 2 minutes at rest, for 4 minutes during complete ischaemia of tibialis anterior muscle, and for twelve minutes during recovery. Test II (all subjects): hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy and surface EMG were measured for 2 minutes with the subjects performing brief non-fatiguing contractions, for 4 minutes with the subject performing maximal isometric contraction in complete ischaemia, and for twelve minutes during recovery. EMG parameters measured: median density frequency (MDF); muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV). NIR spectroscopy parameters measured: percentage of amplitude decrement (%AD) and nadir time (NT) during ischaemia and ischaemic effort; half-recovery time (1/2 RT) from ischaemia effort. Results. At EMG, we observed a significant shift towards lower values of both MFCV and MDF during fatiguing isometric contraction, MDF recovery was faster then MFCV recovery. At NIR spectroscopy, the 1/2 RT slowed a fast pattern in twelve subjects and a slow pattern in five. 4 significant relationship was found between AD% and 1/2 RT values of test I and AD% and 1/2 values of test II, We found a positive relationship between NT and 1/2 RT in test II, Conclusions, Surface EMG and hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy can be applied simultaneously to evaluate both fatigue intensity and blood flow changes in striated muscle.";;;;;;ZAMBARBIERI, DANIELA TERESA/0000-0001-9779-5345;;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-4707;;;;;JUN;1999;39;2;;;;;83;92;;;;;;;;;;;10399414;;;;;WOS:000080979800001;

However, research is lacking in what kind of programmatic interventions virtual schools might be particularly well-suited to provide to improve math performance. Engaging students in self-reflection is a potentially promising pedagogical approach for supporting math learning. Nonetheless, it is unclear how models for math learning in brick and mortar classrooms translate in an online learning environment. The purpose of this study was to (a) analyze assessment data from virtual schools to explore the association between self-reflection and math performance, (b) compare the patterns found in student self-reflection across elementary, middle, and high school levels, and (c) examine whether providing opportunities for self-reflection had positive impact on math performance in an online learning environment. In this study, the self-reflection assessments were developed and administered multiple times within several math courses during the 2014-15 school year. These assessments included 47 questions that asked students to reflect on their understanding of the knowledge and skills they learned in the preceding lessons and units. Using these assessments, multiple constructs and indicators were measured, which included confidence about the topic knowledge/understanding, general feelings towards math, accuracy of self-judgment against actual test performance, and frequency of self-reflection. Through a series of three retrospective studies, data were collected from full-time virtual school students who took three math courses (one elementary, one middle, and one high school math course) in eight virtual schools in the United States during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years. The results showed that (a) participation in self-reflection varied by grade, unit test performance level, and course/topic difficulty; (b) more frequent participation in self-reflection and higher self-confidence level were associated with higher final course performance; and (c) self-reflection, as was implemented here, showed limited impact for more difficult topics, higher grade courses, and higher performing students.

Each instrument has its own control unit. The Instrument Command and Data Processing Unit (VI-CDPU) is the control unit of the VIS instrument. The VI-CDPU is connected directly to the spacecraft by means of a MIL-STD-1553B bus and to the satellite Mass Memory Unit via a Space Wire link. All the internal interfaces are implemented via Space Wire links and include 12 high speed lines for the data provided by the 36 focal plane CCDs readout electronics (ROEs) and one link to the Power and Mechanisms Control Unit (VI-PMCU). VI-CDPU is in charge of distributing commands to the instrument sub-systems, collecting their housekeeping parameters and monitoring their health status. Moreover, the unit has the task of acquiring, reordering, compressing and transferring the science data to the satellite Mass Memory. This last feature is probably the most challenging one for the VI-CDPU, since stringent constraints about the minimum lossless compression ratio, the maximum time for the compression execution and the maximum power consumption have to be satisfied. Therefore, an accurate performance analysis at hardware layer is necessary, which could delay too much the design and development of software. In order to mitigate this risk, in the multilayered design of software we decided to design a middleware layer that provides a set of APIs with the aim of hiding the implementation of the HW connected layer to the application one. The middleware is built on top of the Operating System layer (which includes the Real-Time OS that will be adopted) and the onboard Computer Hardware. The middleware itself has a multi-layer architecture composed of 4 layers: the Abstract RTOS Adapter Layer (AOSAL), the Specific RTOS Adapter Layer (SOSAL), the Common Patterns Layer (CPL), the Service Layer composed of two subgroups which are the Common Service (CSL) and the Specific Service layer (SSL). The middleware design is made using the UML 2.0 standard. The AOSAL includes the abstraction of services provided by a generic RTOS (e.g Thread/Task, Time Management, Mutex and Semaphores) as well as an abstraction of Space Wire and 1553-B bus Interface. The SOSAL is the implementation of AOSAL for the adopted RTOS. The CPL provides a set of patterns that are a general solution for common problems related to embedded hard Real Time systems. This set includes patterns for memory management, homogenous redundancy channels, pipes and filters for data exchange, proxies for slow memories, watchdog and reactive objects. The CPL is designed using a soft-metamodeling approach, so as to be as general as possible. Finally, the SL provides a set of services that are common to space applications. The testing of this middleware can be done both during the design using appropriate tools of analysis and in the implementation phase by means of unit testing tools.;;;;;"Cropper, Mark S/C-1574-2008; Liu, Scige J/N-4680-2015; Di Giorgio, Anna Maria/HLX-2021-2023";"Liu, Scige J/0000-0001-7680-2139; Di Giorgio, Anna Maria/0000-0002-4767-2360; Giusi, Giovanni/0000-0003-3549-7195; Li Causi, Gianluca/0000-0001-9539-2112; Pezzuto, Stefano/0000-0001-7852-1971; Farina, Maria/0000-0002-3089-7846; Galli, Emanuele/0000-0003-0645-4989; Cropper, Mark/0000-0003-4571-9468";;;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;1996-756X;978-0-8194-9620-1;;;;2014;9152;;;;;;;;91520Y;10.1117/12.2056173;http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2056173;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000347467300031;

However, TDD is one of the most challenging agile practices to adopt because it requires changes to work practices and skill sets. It is therefore important to gain an understanding of TDD through the experiences of those who have successfully adopted this practice. We collaborated with an agile team to provide this experience report on their adoption of TDD, using observations and interviews within the product development environment. This article highlights a number of practices that underlie successful development with TDD. To provide a theoretical perspective that can help to explain how TDD supports a positive philosophy of software development, we have revised Northover et al.'s conceptual framework, which is based on a four stage model of agile development, to reinterpret Popper's theory of conjecture and falsification in the context of agile testing strategies. As a result of our findings, we propose an analytical model for TDD in agile software development which provides a theoretical basis for further investigations into the role of TDD and related practices.;;;;;"Parsons, David/HLX-9156-2023; Parsons, David/AAI-6071-2021";Parsons, David/0000-0002-9815-036X;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1999-5903;;;;DEC;2011;3;4;;;;;281;297;;10.3390/fi3040281;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi3040281;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000215323000004;

Contrasting with the current embedded engineering practices, Test-Driven Development (TDD) promotes testing software during its development, even before the target hardware becomes available. Principally, TDD promotes a fast feedback cycle in which a test is written before the implementation. Moreover, each test is added to a test suite, which runs at every step in the TDD cycle. As a consequence, test-driven code is well tested and maintainable. Still, embedded software has some typical properties which impose challenges to apply the TDD cycle. Essentially, uploading software to target is generally too time-consuming to frequently run tests on target. Secondary issues are hardware dependencies and limited resources, such as memory footprint or processing power. In order to deal with these limitations, four methods have been identified and evaluated. Furthermore, a number of relevant design patterns are discussed to apply TDD in an embedded environment.;;;;;Boydens, Jeroen/A-1280-2014;"Boydens, Jeroen/0000-0002-7902-8537; Cordemans, Piet/0000-0002-0017-2908";;;;;;;;;;;;;1860-949X;;978-3-642-40887-8;;;;2014;520;;;;;;91;130;;10.1007/978-3-642-40888-5_4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40888-5_4;10.1007/9-78-3-642-40888-5;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000408070600004;

Consequently, numerous tools, techniques, paradigms, and strategies that facilitate the quality assurance of the developed applications have emerged. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of those strategies. In contrast to the traditional approach, it places testing ahead of the actual implementation, which, in turn, also heavily influences the system's design. With the approach being rather complex, naturally, guidance on its correct application is one of the most relevant aspects for many practitioners. To provide assistance to them, but also to researchers concerned with the domain, the publication at hand identifies twenty guidelines for the practical application of TDD in software engineering, by conducting a structured literature review. In doing so, it provides a solid foundation for the implementation of corresponding endeavors as well as a starting point for further discussion.;;;;;;"Volk, Matthias/0000-0002-4835-919X; Staegemann, Daniel/0000-0001-9957-1003; Pohl, Matthias/0000-0002-6241-7675";;;;;;;;;;;;;2367-3370;2367-3389;"978-981-19-2397-5; 978-981-19-2396-8";;;;2023;465;;;;;;327;336;;10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000894285700030;

They involve web technologies organized in the cloud platform which supports translation of services to a wider community. Such cloud applications are more vulnerable to misuse. Consequently, system development needs to focus on system security features in a comprehensive manner. Therefore, techniques that are based on test-driven development will be a good choice to use for the quality maintenance of such systems. We need checklists and mechanisms that provide identification and knowledge of best practices to maintain consistency in performing testing activities. We propose a test patterns-based technique which supports identification of test cases on the bases of specification and domain analysis of system under test. We provide a set of test patterns that support Test Driven Development (TDD) as well. We link misuse cases and security requirement to testing and provide test patterns for testing cloud applications.

This is the essence of test driven development, an agile practice built upon sound software engineering principles. When applied effectively, this practice can have many benefits. The question becomes how to effectively adopt test driven development. This paper describes the experiences and lessons learned by two teams who adopted test driven development methodology for software systems developed at TransCanada. The overall success of test driven methodology is contingent upon the following key factors: experienced team champion, well-defined test scope, supportive database environment, repeatable software design pattern, and complementary manual testing. All of these factors and the appropriate test regime will lead to a better chance of success in a test driven development project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;972-8865-69-4;;;;2006;;;;;;;159;164;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000242043900027;

The methods are mapped to the four quadrants of technical debt introduced by Martin Fowler in order to show how they can help to avoid the accumulation of technical debt. The resulting data show that a very low defect density can be achieved with these practices, which helps to avoid technical debt introduced for example by quick fixes during a late project phase.

Different levels of experience, types of application and needs enforce differences in performing testing activity for same features of applications. Testing as an activity within a development house usually includes testing of recurrent situation e.g., testing of security features etc. Development of a homogeneous test ground requires considering information regarding the structure of real world scenarios. We propose a test pattern based technique which supports identification of test cases on the basis of specification and domain analysis. The proposed technique provides support for Test Driven Development (TDD) and Test Last Development (TLD). We provide test patterns for testing cloud applications where we study what features an application would bear and we propose what test cases must exist in the test suite for that application.

To realize secure designs, we propose extended security patterns, which include requirement-and design-level patterns as well as a new model testing process. Our approach is implemented in a tool called TESEM (Test Driven Secure Modeling Tool), which supports pattern applications by creating a script to execute model testing automatically. During an early development stage, the developer specifies threats and vulnerabilities in the target system, and then TESEM verifies whether the security patterns are properly applied and assesses whether these vulnerabilities are resolved.;;;;;鷲崎, 弘宜/AAG-1448-2019;鷲崎, 弘宜/0000-0002-1417-9879;;;;;;;;;;;;;2159-4848;;978-1-4799-7125-1;;;;2015;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000380913300055;

These distinctions are increasingly important as software becomes prevalent in the design tools and products of other engineering disciplines. By considering what is similar and what is different we help reveal how the lessons of software design may help other disciplines, and vice versa. This in turn illuminates a core meta-question of how educators in academia and industry can help evolve our understanding of what we do so that we can be more effective at software design.

However, in the TDD/CDMA cellular system, uplink signals may suffer strong interference from the downlink transmission of neighboring base stations. This kind of opposite direction interference has adverse impact on the TDD/CDMA system performance. In this paper, we propose to apply the MVDR beamforming technique to suppress the opposite direction interference. We evaluate the uplink performance of the proposed technique by simulation. Moreover, by jointly employing transmit beamforming in all asynchronous cells, the TDD/CDMA cellular system can allow different rates of asymmetry in different cells. Thus, each cell can design its own pattern of slot allocation.;;;;;"Wang, Li-Chun/AAD-7164-2022; Wang, LI-Chun/C-1910-2009";"Wang, Li-Chun/0000-0002-7883-6217; Wang, LI-Chun/0000-0002-7883-6217";;;;;;;;;;;;;1550-2252;;0-7803-7467-3;;;;2002;;;;;;;141;145;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000179406100029;

In this paper, we provide a performance assessment for the co-existence of a macro (eMBB) and a local factory (URLLC) network and evaluate the network conditions under which the latency and reliability requirements of factory automation applications are met. In particular, we evaluate the coexistence of the eMBB and URLLC networks under two scenarios: (i) synchronized TDD, in which both networks follow the same TDD pattern, and (ii) unsynchronized TDD, in which the eMBB and URLLC networks follow different TDD patterns. Simulation results show that the high downlink interference from the macro base stations towards the factory results in a reduction of the downlink URLLC capacity and service availability in case of synchronized TDD and a reduction of the uplink URLLC capacity and service availability in case of unsynchronized TDD. Finally, it is shown that a promising case for co-existence is the adjacent channel allocation, for both synchronized and unsynchronized TDD deployments. Here, the required isolation to protect the URLLC network in the worst-case scenario where the factory is located next to a macro site can be handled via the factory wall penetration loss (e.g., considering high concrete or metal-coated building walls) along with other solutions such as filters, larger separation distance, and band pairing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2577-2465;;978-1-7281-1220-6;;;;2019;;;;;;;;;;10.1109/vtcfall.2019.8890977;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/vtcfall.2019.8890977;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000610542200004;

Massive MIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance the average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time-division duplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) subframe configurations, is a promising enhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic TDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic patterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference among cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique characteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a marriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the limitation of dynamic TDD in macrocell (MC) networks. Specifically, we advocate that the benefits of dynamic TDD can be fully extracted in MC networks equipped with massive MIMO, i.e., the BS-to-BS interference can be effectively removed by increasing the number of BS antennas. We provide detailed analysis using random matrix theory to show that the effect of the BS-to-BS interference on UL transmissions vanishes as the number of BS antennas per user grows infinitely large. Last but not least, we validate our analysis by numerical simulations.;;;;;samani, Hooman/AAF-3524-2021;"samani, Hooman/0000-0003-1494-2798; Huang, Yan/0000-0003-0544-6602";;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-8184;1937-9234;;;;MAR;2019;13;1;;;;;117;124;;10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829350;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829350;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000459697700012;

Individual responses to CSII are diverse. The aim was to identify unique three-variate patterns of HbA1c, BMI standard deviation score (SDS), and TDD after switching to CSII. Methods Five thousand one hundred and thirty-three youths (<= 20 years; 48% boys; median age at pump start 12.5 years) with T1D duration >= 3 years at CSII initiation were selected from the multicenter DPV registry. We applied group-based multitrajectory modeling to identify groups of individuals following similar trajectories. Measurements were aggregated quarterly during a 3-year follow-up period. Trajectory variables were changes of HbA1c, BMI-SDS, and TDD from baseline (delta = quarterly aggregated values at each time point [i] minus the respective baseline value). Results Four groups of diverging Delta-HbA1c, Delta-BMI-SDS, and Delta-TDD patterns were identified. All showed improvements in HbA1c during the first 3 months. Group 1 (12%) was characterized by modest HbA1c increase thereafter, TDD reduction, and stable BMI-SDS. In Group 2 (39%), increasing HbA1c, decreasing BMI-SDS, and stable TDD were found. By contrast, sustainably improved HbA1c, increasing BMI-SDS, and stable TDD were observed in Group 3 (32%). Group 4 (17%) was characterized by increasing levels for HbA1c, BMI-SDS, and TDD. Between-group differences in baseline HbA1c, BMI-SDS, TDD as well as in sex ratio, age at diabetes onset and at pump start were observed.

To avoid cross-slot interference between downlink and uplink, traditional algorithms typically require a global control on the transmission direction in each time slot among all cells. Obviously, this requirement significantly limits one of the key advantages in the TDD system -- enabling different rate asymmetry. We observe that the tri-sector cellular architecture possesses additional orthogonality inherently due to the directivity of directional antenna, which can provide an additional degree of freedom in allocating radio resource (i.e., time slots). Thus we propose a new distributed slot allocation algorithm based on the tri-sector cellular architecture. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is to enable a TDD-CDMA system to provide asymmetric services with different rates of asymmetry in all cells, thereby having more flexibility in handling uniform traffic patterns.;;;;;"Wang, Li-Chun/AAD-7164-2022; Wang, LI-Chun/C-1910-2009";"Wang, Li-Chun/0000-0002-7883-6217; Wang, LI-Chun/0000-0002-7883-6217";;;;;;;;;;;;;1550-2252;;0-7803-7484-3;;;;2002;;;;;;;327;330;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000177471200067;

However, in addition to conventional interference, the cross-link interference (CI) resulted by asymmetric uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission in D-TDD operation may further degrade system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic interference mitigation (OIM) framework to enhance D-TDD in UDNs by exploiting multi-user diversity in conjunction with interference-aware transmission. In particular, we first decompose the interference patterns experienced by D-TDD in a typical three-cell network, and propose novel interference alignment (IA) inspired opportunistic user scheduling and transmission schemes for each interference pattern. Our scheme mainly relies on the reference signal space (RSS) that guides the transmit beamforming and user scheduling to align the generated interference at a predefined subspace in each AP receiver with best effort. Numerical results show that our schemes can effectively mitigate the CI in D-TDD, and in conjunction with modified opportunistic IA for pure UL/DL transmission, our OIM framework achieves substantial performance again over the conventional schemes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2164-7038;;978-1-5386-4328-0;;;;2018;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000445022200041;

In the TDD-CDMA system, the transmission for asymmetric traffic from neighboring cells may cause the cross-slot interference, which can seriously degrade system capacity. To avoid the cross-slot interference for TDD-CDMA systems, many current resource allocation algorithms typically require a global control on the transmission direction (either downlink or uplink) in each time slot. Apparently, this requirement substantially constrains the flexibility of TDD-CDMA systems to deliver asymmetric traffic services in a more practical situation where every cell may have different uplink and downlink bandwidth requirements. We analyze the interference of the TDD-CDMA system with a trisector cellular architecture, where three directional antennas are employed at each base station. We find that the directivity of directional antennas can provide an additional degree of freedom for allocating radio resource. Taking advantage of this property, we introduce the concept of virtual cell, defined as the same converge area of a cell but is composed of three sectors from the three adjacent base stations. Furthermore, we propose a new virtual cell-based distributed code/time slot allocation algorithm to enable a TDD-CDMA system to provide asymmetric services with different rates of asymmetry in every cell coverage area. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm does not only offer more flexibility in handling nonuniform traffic patterns, but maintain good radio link performance and call blocking performance.;;;;;"Wang, LI-Chun/C-1910-2009; Wang, Li-Chun/AAD-7164-2022";"Wang, LI-Chun/0000-0002-7883-6217; Wang, Li-Chun/0000-0002-7883-6217; Wang, LI-Chun/0000-0002-9242-2352";;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9545;1939-9359;;;;MAY;2005;54;3;;;;;1056;1069;;10.1109/TVT.2005.844660;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2005.844660;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000229254800030;

Using heterogeneous computation system (e.g.: CPU+GPU) is a promising way to increase the performance of the calculation. Therefore, we created a solution based on the OpenCL framework which is one of the most popular heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, the new pattern matching framework and the main steps of its creation are presented. The applied conception consists of two main steps. Firstly, a simpler case study is solved and experiences are collected from the occurring challenges. Secondly, the achieved solution was extended for general pattern matching. In both steps, the core algorithms are implemented according to the test-driven development methodology.

It notably improves the network resource utilization with sporadic directional packet arrivals. Although, the feasibility of the ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) within such deployments is critically challenged, mainly due to the crosslink interference (CLI). In this work, we propose a semistatic and computationally-efficient TDD radio frame adaptation algorithm for 5G macro deployments. Particularly, we first identify the quasi-static variance of the cross-cell traffic buffering performance, with various CLI co-existence conditions. Accordingly, a common radio frame pattern is dynamically estimated based on the filtered multi-cell traffic statistics. Our system-level simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves a highly improved URLLC outage performance, i.e., offering similar to 40% reduction gain of the achievable URLLC outage latency compared to perfect static-TDD, and approaching the optimal interference-free flexible-TDD case; though, with a significantly lower control overhead size.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1525-3511;;978-1-7281-3106-1;;;;2020;;;;;;;;;;10.1109/wcnc45663.2020.9120508;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/wcnc45663.2020.9120508;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000569342900056;

To reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) at low thickness, Ge deposition with cyclic annealing followed by HCl etching is performed. In the case of blanket Ge deposition, a TDD of 1.3x10(6) cm(-2) is obtained, when the Ge layer is etched back from 4.5 mu m thickness to 1.8 mu m. The TDD is not increased relative to the situation before etching. The root mean square of roughness of the 1.8 mu m thick Ge is about 0.46 nm, which is of the same level as before HCl etching. Further etching shows increased surface roughness caused by non-uniform strain distribution near the interface due to misfit dislocations and threading dislocations. The TDD also becomes higher because the etchfront of Ge reaches areas with high dislocation density near the interface. In the case of selective Ge growth, a slightly lower TDD is observed in smaller windows caused by a weak pattern size dependence on Ge thickness. A significant decrease of TDD of selectively grown Ge is also observed by increasing the Ge thickness. An about 10 times lower TDD at the same Ge thickness is demonstrated by applying a combination of deposition and etching processes during selective Ge growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A set of clinical rules was established to adjust the TDD based on these three concentrations, as might be done in the clinical setting. Another set of concentrations using these TDM-derived TDDs for each subject (600-1600 mg) was simulated. A standard population pharmacokinetic analysis of the post-TDM data was conducted using NONMEM. This process was replicated 100 times to estimate the type II error rate. When CL was modeled without TDD, plots of WRES versus PRED demonstrated a clear pattern, as did the delta plots of CL (CL minus TVCL) versus TDD, suggesting the covariate TDD should be incorporated into the model. After TDD was included in the model for CL, the objective function value decreased by an average of 75.7 (p < 0.001). In addition, the inter-individual variability in CL expressed as a coefficient of variation decreased by an average of 9.9% and the diagnostic plots improved. Although CL was simulated to be independent of TDD, it was identified as an important covariate using standard approaches in a simulated TDM setting in 100% of the replicated simulation studies. The TDM process introduces a correlation between CL and TDD that can be misinterpreted as nonlinearity in the system;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1567-567X;1573-8744;;;;DEC;2005;32;5-6;;;;;703;718;;10.1007/s10928-005-0083-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10928-005-0083-6;;;;;;;;16328100;;;;;WOS:000233867400005;

However, the insulin requirement profiles of patients with type 2 diabetes when treated via CSII with rapid-acting insulin analogs have not been well investigated. Methods: We examined insulin requirement profiles of type 2 diabetes patients (n = 300; age, 57.9 +/- 11.4 years; hemoglobin A1c [HbA(1c)], 9.1 +/- 2.2%) for 3 days after achieving normoglycemia via 1-2 weeks of CSII therapy. We also analyzed the total daily dose (TDD) of insulin-associated clinical and laboratory parameters at baseline. Results: The mean TDD was 45.1 +/- 24.7 IU/day (range, 4.8-145.8 IU/day). The total daily bolus (TBo) (range 2.8-111.3 IU/day) was 64.1 +/- 12.1% of the TDD. The rates of infusion for day and night in total daily basal dose (TBa) were 0.74 +/- 0.35 and 0.41 +/- 0.32 IU/h, respectively. The dose ratio (in IU/day) was 2.7 : 1.9 : 1.6 : 1.8 : 1 (breakfast, lunch, and dinner bolus and day and night basal, respectively). After adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index, TDD was associated with HbA(1c), fasting and 2-h postprandial plasma glucose, fasting C-peptide, and carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Initial TDD in type 2 diabetes patients on CSII showed a wide range of distribution with a TBo-to-TBa ratio >2.0 and was associated with parameters indicating glycemic control but not with body weight, suggesting that the currently used protocol in dose determination of insulin, including allocation of half of the TDD to TBa or weight-based determination of initial TDD, may need to be reexamined when treating type 2 diabetes with CSII therapy.";;;;;Lee, Jong Hwan/D-8530-2011;"Lee, Junho/0000-0003-0913-8578; Lee, Won Jin/0000-0002-0254-7267";;;;;;;;;;;;;1520-9156;1557-8593;;;;APR;2010;12;4;;;;;271;281;;10.1089/dia.2009.0131;http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dia.2009.0131;;;;;;;;20210565;;;;;WOS:000275301700004;

To fulfill this requirement, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) proposed dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) technology in Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release 11. Afterward, the 3GPP RAN#86 meeting clarified that 5G NR needs to support dynamic adjustment of the duplex pattern (transmission direction) in the time domain. Although 5G NR provides a more flexible duplex pattern, how to configure an effective duplex pattern according to services traffic is still an open research area. In this research, we propose a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based decentralized D-TDD configuration method. First, we model a D-TDD configuration problem as a dynamic programming problem. Given the buffer length of all UE, we model the D-TDD configuration policy as a conditional probability distribution. Our goal is to find a D-TDD configuration policy that maximizes the expected discount return of all UE's sum rates. Second, in order to reduce signaling overhead, we design a fully decentralized solution with distributed MARL technology. Each agent in MARL makes decisions only based on local observations. We regard each base station (BS) as an agent, and each agent configures uplink and downlink time slot ratio according to length of intra-BS user (UE) queue buffer. Third, in order to solve the problem of overall system revenue caused by the lack of global information in MARL, we apply leniency control and binary LSTM (BLSTM) based auto-encoder. Leniency controller effectively controls Q-value estimation process in MARL according to Q-value and current network conditions, and auto-encoder makes up for the defect that leniency control cannot handle complex environments and high-dimensional data. Through the parallel distributed training, the global D-TDD policy is obtained. This method deploys the MARL algorithm on the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server of each BS and uses the storage and computing capabilities of the server for distributed training. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed MARL converges stably in various environments, and performs better than distributed deep reinforcement algorithm.;;;;;Gao, Wei/GXH-0380-2022;"Gao, WeiDong/0000-0002-2946-2781; chen, xiangyu/0000-0001-7870-2270";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1424-8220;;;;MAR;2022;22;5;;;;;;;1746;10.3390/s22051746;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22051746;;;;;;;;35270890;;;;;WOS:000768901000001;

The uplink load is impacted by many elements, such as MUD factor, antenna beam pattern and the number of main beams, and so on. The antenna beam partner and the number of main beam make more important influences than the MUD factor in the uplink performances.

Recently, D-TDD has gained much attention as an efficient duplex scheme for high-speed data communications, because adaptive switching ability enables a system to obtain statistical multiplexing gain by exploiting dynamic and asymmetric data traffic. However, it has been noted that strong co-channel interference can be present due to adaptive switching in a cellular network that uses frequency reuse. To suppress the effect of strong co-channel interference and obtain the benefit of D-TDD, we employ time slot allocation (TSA) strategy along with sector antenna layouts. In addition to bandwidths adaptation to the dynamic and asymmetric traffic pattern, we also change the transmission mode based on the channel state of each link. For each time slot, the modulation level can be adaptively selected from multilevel transmission modes, satisfying the required packet error rate (PER) performance. Hence, the algorithm not only suppresses co-channel interference by co-operative time slot allocation, but also adopts multi-level transmission modes, with different modulation formats and coding for each time slot, so that maximum spectral efficiency can be achieved. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of these systems.;;;;;Kavehrad, Mohsen/AAJ-1958-2021;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2155-7578;;0-7803-8847-X;;;;2004;;;;;;;1047;1053;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000230724200164;

Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consisting of low-power small cells underlying the existing macro cells represent the preferred solution to increase the capacity of cellular systems by means of spatial spectrum reuse. Static uplink/downlink time-division duplexing (TDD) configurations of existing networks cannot satisfy the varying traffic patterns of large number of small cells, which vary among cells and over time. In this paper we propose and evaluate a centralized algorithm for dynamic TDD frame configuration to which operates on a cluster-based cellular network, maximize the network throughput and preserving fairness. Our algorithm is characterized by only O (nlogn) time complexity (with n cells in the network), which allows for instantaneous network-wise reconfigurations minimizing overhead. The algorithm is proven to be optimal and time efficient. Extensive simulation results using realistic application traffic have shown the superiority the proposed solution against static TDD configurations of LTE systems. Throughput improvements up to 43 % as well as reductions in queued traffic at cells up to 52 % are obtained using separate utility functions designed for throughput maximization and fairness respectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2164-7038;;978-1-4673-6305-1;;;;2015;;;;;;;113;118;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000380459900019;

The messages on the discussion board were stratified into problem reports, help requests, development information, and feature requests. The messages in the problem report and help request strata were then sampled and analyzed using thematic analysis, searching for common patterns. Our analysis indicate that a large part of the impediments discussed on the board are related to issues related to the centralized IT environment, and to erroneous behavior connected to the use of the framework and related components. We also observed a large amount of impediments related to the use of software development tools. Turning to the help requests, we found that the majority of the help requests were about designing test scripts and not about the areas that appear to be most problematic. From our results and previous publications, we see a clear need to simplify the use, installation, and configuration of test systems of this type. The problems attributable to software development tools suggest that testers implementing test automation need more skills in handling those tools, than historically has been assumed.

However, there is little data investigating the insulin dose setting during CSII therapy in type 2 diabetes to achieve optimal glycemic control and avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, this study is aimed to assess the dose characteristics of insulin requirement and explore the related clinical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with CSII. A total of 327 patients (195 males) aged 52.9 +/- 12.5 years old were included in this study. Patients were treated with CSII to achieve the target fasting capillary blood glucose (4.4-7.0 mmol L-1) and 2-h postprandial capillary blood glucose (4.4-10.0 mmol L-1) by adjusting insulin infusion according to the seven-point capillary blood glucose profiles. Total daily insulin dose (TDD), total daily insulin dose per kilogram (TDD kg(-1)) and the ratio of total basal insulin dose (TBD) to TDD (%TBa) were calculated after patients achieved the glucose targets for at least 3 days via 1-2 weeks of CSII treatment. And insulin dose, insulin dosing patterns and the relevant clinical factors were analyzed. The mean ratio of basal/bolus insulin distribution of all patients was 40%:60%. Patients with central obesity needed more TDD (51.3 +/- 17.1 U versus 43.5 +/- 14.0 U, P<0.05) and TDD kg(-1) (0.8 +/- 0.3 U kg(-1) versus 0.7 +/- 0.2 U kg(-1), P<0.05) than those without central obesity. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that TDD was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting C-peptide level, 2 h-postprandial C-peptide level and time to achieve glycemic target (all P<0.05); TDD kg(-1) was positively correlated with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), baseline FPG, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting C-peptide level and time to achieve glycemic target, and negatively correlated with BMI (all P<0.05). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that BMI (beta=1.796, P<0.01), WC (beta=0.709, P<0.01), baseline FPG (beta=1.459, P<0.01) and HbA1c (beta=0.930, P=0.021) were independently related to TDD.

Gender (beta=-0.015, P=0.048) and disease duration (beta=0.134, P=0.029) were independently associated with %TBa. %TBa is around 40% in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with CSII when glycemic control is achieved. In addition to body weight or BMI, WC and glucose levels before CSII should be considered to set TDD. Patients with central obesity or poor glycemic control might need more TDD.

In this paper, we propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) scheduling policies for centrally controlled TDD wireless systems. The proposed policies reduce the power consumption of mobile devices by putting them into low power mode intelligently, using probabilistic estimates of inactivity based on the previous traffic arrival pattern.

However, since the radiation pattern of the adaptive array is generally formed on a baseband, the amplitude and phase errors must be calibrated between the branches of the array due to individual differences in the radio frequency (RF) devices of the receivers and transmitters. Moreover, since these errors change over time due to temperature variations, real-time calibration is required.

However, it is still a challenging mission to develop a model with high predictability that captures the horizontal-vertical features of ionospheric electrodynamics. In this study, multiple observations during 2005-2019 from space-borne global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) systems (COSMIC and FY-3C) and the Digisonde Global Ionosphere Radio Observatory are utilized to develop a completely global ionospheric three-dimensional electron density model based on an artificial neural network, namely ANN-TDD. The correlation coefficients of the predicted profiles all exceed 0.96 for the training, validation and test datasets, and the minimum root-mean-square error of the predicted residuals is 7.8 x 10(4) el/cm(3). Under quiet space weather, the predicted accuracy of the ANN-TDD is 30%-60% higher than the IRI-2016 at the Millstone Hill and Jicamarca incoherent scatter radars. However, the ANN-TDD is less capable of predicting ionospheric dynamic evolution under severe geomagnetic storms compared to the IRI-2016 with the STORM option activated. Additionally, the ANN-TDD successfully reproduces the large-scale horizontal-vertical ionospheric electrodynamic features, including seasonal variation and hemispheric asymmetries. These features agree well with the structure revealed by the RO profiles derived from the FORMOSAT/COSMIC-2 mission. Furthermore, the ANN-TDD successfully captures the prominent regional ionospheric patterns, including the equatorial ionization anomaly, Weddell Sea anomaly and mid-latitude summer nighttime anomaly.

This leaves the testing process error prone and time consuming. For satisfied end users with bug-free software delivered on time, there is a need to automate the test oracle process for natural language or informal requirements. The automation of the test oracle is relatively easier with formal requirements, but this task is difficult to achieve with natural language requirements. This study proposes an approach calledRestricted Natural Language Agile Requirements Testing(ReNaLART) to automate the test oracle from restricted natural language agile requirements. For this purpose, it uses an existing user story template with some modifications for writing user stories. This helps in identifying test input and expected output for a user story. For comparison of expected and observed outputs it makes use of a regex pattern and string distance functions. It is capable of assigning different types of verdicts automatically depending upon the similarity/dissimilarity between observed and expected outputs of user stories. ReNaLART is validated using several case studies of different domains, namely, OLX Pakistan, Mental Health Tests, McDelivery Pakistan, BlueStacks, Power Searching with Google, TensorFlow Playground, w3Schools 2018 offline and Touch'D. It revealed several faults in five of the above listed eight applications.

Test-first strategy and code refactoring are the important practices of Extreme Programing for rapid development and quality support. The test-first strategy emphasizes that test cases are designed before system implementation to keep the correctness of artifacts during software development; whereas refactoring is the removal of bad smell code for improving quality without changing its semantics. However, the test-first strategy may conflict with code refactoring in the sense that the original test cases may be broken or inefficient for testing programs, which are revised by code refactoring. In general, the developers revise the test cases manually since it is not complicated. However, when the developers perform a pattern-based refactoring to improve the quality, the effort of revising the test cases is much more than that in simple code refactoring. In our observation, a pattern-based refactoring is composed of many simple and atomic code refactorings. If we have the composition relationship and the mapping rules between code refactoring and test case refactoring, we may infer a test case revision guideline in pattern-based refactoring. Based on this idea, in this research, we propose a four-phase approach to guide the construction of the test case refactoring for design patterns. We also introduce our approach by using some well-known design patterns and evaluate its feasibility by means of test coverage.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0963-9314;1573-1367;;;;MAR;2012;20;1;;;;;43;75;;10.1007/s11219-011-9143-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11219-011-9143-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000298864600002;

However, the outage performance of D-TDD system is severely limited by the strong interference from co-channel cells in a downlink cycle, while the reference cell is in its uplink duty cycle. To suppress the co-channel interference during uplink reception, we consider two kinds of time slot allocation strategies, combined with sector antennas: MaxMin {SIR} and Max {SIR}. MaxMin {SIR} is an optimum time slot allocation strategy, in the sense that it maximizes the minimum signal to interference ratio expectation value over extra uplink time slot region. It is used as a performance benchmark in our analysis. Meanwhile, Max {SIR} is a simple and efficient algorithm to improve outage performance. It is established that the performance difference between the two algorithms is not noticeable, especially when the dynamic range of traffic pattern between the uplink and downlink is small. Also, outage performance comparison between Max {SIR} algorithm and adaptive array antennas is provided. The proposed system shows promise and offers a compromise between system complexity and the desired availability.;;;;;Kavehrad, Mohsen/AAJ-1958-2021;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1550-2252;;0-7803-7005-8;;;;2001;;;;;;;37;41;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000173938400008;

The ice road season start, end and duration principally depend upon ice thickness, which is controlled by surface air temperature (SAT) in terms of freezing and thawing degree-days (FDD and TDD, respectively). Both FDD and TDD are indicators of climate variability and change, and are naturally influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs). This study examined the role of ACPs in interannual variations in the operating season of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road in the Bay of Bothnia, northern Baltic Sea, during 1974-2009. Significant (p < .05) shortening in duration of the ice road season, mainly attributable to later start and earlier end days, was observed. In the Oulu-Hailuoto area, maximum ice thickness showed significant declines over time. This sea ice thinning was associated with SAT warming in cold months, manifested by statistically significant decreases in cumulative FDD during October-January within the water year (September-August). Significant increases in cumulative TDD during February-April, reflecting warmer SAT in mild months, resulted in earlier end day for the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) was the most influential ACP for variations in cumulative FDD (October-January), and accordingly for sea ice thickness and start day of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. However, cumulative TDD (February-April) showed significant positive correlations with the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, which also controlled the end day of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season.;;;;;"Ronkanen, Anna-Kaisa/AAZ-1000-2020; Moradkhani, Hamid/B-1571-2012";"Ronkanen, Anna-Kaisa/0000-0003-3137-6388; Moradkhani, Hamid/0000-0002-2889-999X; Irannezhad, Masoud/0000-0002-9634-5622; Klove, Bjorn/0000-0002-2353-1440; Kiani, Sepideh/0000-0003-0581-2385";;;;;;;;;;;;;0165-232X;1872-7441;;;;JUL;2018;151;;;;;;1;8;;10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.02.010;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.02.010;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000432682200001;

An array of submicron SOI strips is prepared as a patterned substrate, on which Ge is epitaxially grown by chemical vapor deposition. A continuous Ge film is formed by a coalescence of the adjacent Ge crystals on the arrayed SOI strip, while leaving semicylindrical voids on the exposed surface of the buried SiO2 (BOX) layer between the strips. The TDD of the coalesced Ge film is reduced to 1.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(8 )cm(-2), which is approximately a half of 2.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(8 )cm(-2) for a Ge film on an unpatterned SOI. A transmission electron microscope observation reveals that the TDD reduction is derived from a downward bending of the dislocation toward the void. An accumulation of the dislocations at the strip sidewalls also contributes to the TDD reduction.;;;;;Ishikawa, Yasuhiko/L-8874-2014;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0021-4922;1347-4065;;;;SEP 1;2022;61;9;;;;;;;95506;10.35848/1347-4065/ac8630;http://dx.doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/ac8630;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000842239100001;

Code development has been driven by two initial applications: cardiac electrophysiology and cancer development. A large number of cardiac electrophysiology studies have been enabled and performed, including high-performance computational investigations of defibrillation on realistic human cardiac geometries. New models for the initiation and growth of tumours have been developed. In particular, cell-based simulations have provided novel insight into the role of stem cells in the colorectal crypt. Chaste is constantly evolving and is now being applied to a far wider range of problems. The code provides modules for handling common scientific computing components, such as meshes and solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Re-use of these components avoids the need for researchers to 're-invent the wheel' with each new project, accelerating the rate of progress in new applications. Chaste is developed using industrially-derived techniques, in particular test-driven development, to ensure code quality, re-use and reliability. In this article we provide examples that illustrate the types of problems Chaste can be used to solve, which can be run on a desktop computer. We highlight some scientific studies that have used or are using Chaste, and the insights they have provided.

The number of channels on the Base Station varied from 4 to 60, with a throughput of 600 kbps, where the considered efficiency parameter was the minimum number of channels required for each channel pattern. The simulations were performed in three different scenarios for different traffic profiles for downlink and uplink, and the analyzes of the performance, taken as a measure of the efficiency arrival rate and waiting time before the user's typical applications used in-band technology licensed WiMAX, which follows this pattern.

Methods: Hospital records of non-critically ill patients treated with basal insulin prior to admission were identified. After exclusion of records in which a confounding factor influencing insulin dosing was present, 258 patient-admissions over a 3-year time period were included. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between adjustments to home insulin total daily dose (TDD) and inpatient glycemic control within the first 48 h, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results: On hospital days 1 (HD1) and 2 (HD2), the home insulin TDD was reduced by 43.5% and 23.9%, respectively. Reductions in the home TDD ranging from 10% to 50% were not associated with normoglycemia or hyperglycemia, whereas increases ranging from 10% to 50% were associated with 2-5-fold increased odds of hyperglycemia. For patients with home insulin TDD >= 0.4 units/kg/day, a weight-based dose of 0.4-0.6 units/kg/day was associated with significantly higher odds of normoglycemia on HD2 (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.42-11.21) compared to lower doses. Conclusions: Compared to less aggressive increases, home insulin dose increases ranging from 10% to 50% were associated with greater odds of hyperglycemia without increased odds of hypoglycemia during early hospitalization. Weight-based insulin dosing may be a preferred strategy for glycemic control among patients whose home TDD is >= 0.4 units/kg/day. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For dynamic time division duplex (TDD) systems, the real-time optimization of the radio pattern selection becomes of a vital significance in achieving decent URLLC outage latency. In this study, a dual reinforcement machine learning (RML) approach is developed for online pattern optimization in 5G new radio TDD deployments. The proposed solution seeks to minimizing the maximum URLLC tail latency, i.e., min-max problem, by introducing nested RML instances. The directional and real-time traffic statistics are monitored and given to the primary RML layer to estimate the sufficient number of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) symbols across the upcoming radio pattern. The secondary RML sub-networks determine the DL and UL symbol structure which best minimizes the URLLC outage latency. The proposed solution is evaluated by extensive and highly-detailed system level simulations, where our results demonstrate a considerable URLLC outage latency improvement with the proposed scheme, compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic-TDD proposals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2169-3536;;;;;;2020;8;;;;;;132922;132936;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011026;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011026;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000554375700001;

To realize an even more cost-effective network, we have studied the accommodation of MFH and secondary services in a single TDM-PON. We focus on the fact that a time division duplex (TDD) scheme will be applied to future radio access (FRA). Since a PON link is a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme, whereas a radio propagation link is a TDD scheme, unallocated intervals occur periodically in the PON link. For the above reason, we have already proposed a technique for estimating unallocated intervals in a TDD-based MFH link that involves pre-learning based on a test signal transmission, and the signal of the secondary service is accommodated in the unallocated intervals. However, a scheme for recovering from an error when the estimation is wrong and the test signal is not transmitted has yet to be studied. This paper proposes an estimation technique without a test signal transmission and an estimation-error recovery scheme. The proposed estimator calculates the correlation coefficient between captured uplink traffic and the seven types of uplink and downlink ratio patterns standardized by the third generation partnership project (3GPP: http://www.3gpp.org/).We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation technique by using a numerical simulation. The recovery scheme detects the estimation error and re-allocates the bandwidth. We implement the estimator and the recovery scheme in a 10 Gigabit Ethernet PON (10G-EPON) prototype. We report the feasibility of the proposed scheme along with experimental results.;;;;;Nakayama, Yu/J-4484-2019;Nakayama, Yu/0000-0002-6945-7055;;;;;;;;;;;;;1943-0620;1943-0639;;;;FEB;2018;10;2;;;;;104;113;;10.1364/JOCN.10.000104;http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.10.000104;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000425611500019;

METHODS Retrospective multicenter chart review was made of TDD patients admitted with cardiac crises, defined as development of ventricular tachycardia (VT), cardiomyopathy, or cardiac arrest during metabolic crises. RESULTS Twenty-seven children were admitted for 43 cardiac crises (median age 6.4 years; interquartile range [IQR] 2.4-9.8 years) at 14 centers. During crisis, QTc prolongation occurred in all (median 547 ms; IQR 504-600 ms) and a type I Brugada pattern in 8 (26%). Arrhythmias included VT in 21 (78%), supraventricular tachycardia in 3 (11%), and heart block in 1 (4%). Nineteen patients (70%) developed cardiomyopathy, and 20 (74%) experienced a cardiac arrest. There were 10 deaths (37%), 6 related to arrhythmias. In 5 patients, recalcitrant VT occurred despite use of antiarrhythmic drugs. In 6 patients, arrhythmias were controlled after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support; 5 of these patients survived. Among 10 patients who survived VT without ECMO, successful treatment included intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, and atrial pacing in multiple cases and verapamil in 1 patient. Initiation of feeds seemed to decrease VT events. CONCLUSION TDD-related cardiac crises are associated with a high risk of arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and death. Although further studies are needed, early recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Acutely, intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, atrial pacing, and ECMO as a last resort seem to be the best current treatment options, and early initiation of feeds may prevent VT events.";;;;;Liberman, Leonardo/JGD-5670-2023;"Liberman, Leonardo/0000-0002-5492-6584; Beach, Cheyenne/0000-0001-7121-3001; Azamian, Mahshid/0000-0002-8543-8284";;;;;;;;;;;;;1547-5271;1556-3871;;;;OCT;2022;19;10;;;;;1673;1681;;10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.05.009;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.05.009;;SEP 2022;;;;;;35568137;;;;;WOS:000890298300014;

It is expected that TD-LTE will be more rapidly deployed in near future and most of WiMax operators will upgrade their networks to TD-LTE gradually. Before completely upgrading to TD-LTE, WiMax may coexist with TD-LTE in an adjacent frequency band. In addition, multiple TD-LTE operators may deploy their networks in adjacent bands. When more than one TDD network operates in adjacent frequency bands, severe interference may happen due to adjacent channel interference (ACI) and unsynchronized operations. In this paper, coexistence issues between TD-LTE and other systems are analyzed and coexistence requirements are provided. This paper has three research objectives. First, frame synchronization between TD-LTE and WiMax is discussed by investigating possible combinations of TD-LTE and WiMax configurations. Second, an uplink scheduling algorithm is proposed to utilize a leakage pattern of ACI in synchronized operations. Third, minimum requirements for coexistence in unsynchronized operations are analyzed by introducing a concept of adjacent-channel coupling loss. From the analysis and simulation results, we can see that coexistence of TD-LTE with other TDD systems is feasible if the two networks are synchronized. For the unsynchronized case, some special cell-site engineering techniques may be required to reduce the ACI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1537-744X;;;;;;2014;;;;;;;;;685102;10.1155/2014/685102;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/685102;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000332310900001;

TDD dynamic UL/DL reconfiguration, under discussion in LTE Release 12, enables cells to quickly adapt the ratio of allocated UL and DL subframes to changing traffic patterns which can be different for neighboring cells. Having different UL/DL directions for the same subframe in adjacent cells can result in new destructive interference components, i.e., eNB-to-eNB and UE-to-UE, with levels that can significantly differ from one subframe to another. In this paper, UL power control mechanisms are considered to manage such interference, where different sets of UL subframes use different UL power control parameters. In particular, two schemes are studied where, in one, fixed subframe sets are chosen based on expected interference and, in the other, the eNB monitors interference levels in the subframes and dynamically reconfigures the subframe sets accordingly. The performance of each scheme is evaluated through system level simulations and it is shown that the UL power control with dynamic UL subframe set configuration outperforms the one with static UL subframe sets, with significant improvement achieved at cell edge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2379-1268;;978-1-4799-5249-6;;;;2014;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000357018500041;

The CDMA/TDD system can alleviate this problem, however previous work in this area can not manage efficiently the traffic asymmetry among cells. In this paper we propose a new time slot allocation scheme that considers the traffic pattern of each cell. To solve the inter-cell interference problem, we divide a cell's area into two regions and we allocate the resource of crossed slots to mobile stations which are existing in the inner-region. This proposed scheme increases the resource utilization and decreases the blocking probability of the system as a whole.

The authors' two previously proposed ideas, namely, Load-Based Power Saving (LBPS) and Virtual Time, are adopted in the design, and two strategies, namely, top-down and bottom-up each with three LBPS schemes are proposed. In the top-down strategy, the load as well as the channel quality on the backhaul link is first considered to determine the sleep pattern for all relay nodes, and then the sleep schedule for UEs under each relay node is determined accordingly. On the contrary, the load and the channel quality on the access links are first considered and then integrated into the sleep schedule on the backhaul link. Two associated mechanisms for the proposed LBPS schemes to operate in the virtual time domain are also proposed in the paper, i.e., calculation of the virtual subframe capacity and the mapping mechanisms from the virtual time to the actual time. The benefit of the proposed schemes in power saving over the standard-based scheme is demonstrated by the simulation study, and the bottom-up scheme of BU-Split outperforms the other schemes under equally distributed input load as well as the hotspot scenario.

Five Antillean manatees, Trichechus manatus manatus, were captured in Chetumal Bay and tagged with GPS tracking devices. The radios were equipped with a micropower saltwater sensor (SWS), which records the times when the tag assembly was submerged. The information was analyzed to establish individual fine-scale behaviors. For each fix, we established the following variables: distance (D), sampling interval (T), movement rate (D/T), number of dives (N), and total diving duration (TDD). We used logic criteria and simple scatterplots to distinguish between behavioral categories: 'Travelling' (D/T >= 3 km/h), 'Surface' (down arrow TDD, down arrow N), 'Bottom feeding' (up arrow TDD, up arrow N) and 'Bottom resting' (up arrow TDD,down arrow N). Habitat categories were qualitatively assigned: Lagoon, Channels, Caye shore, City shore, Channel edge, and Open areas. The instrumented individuals displayed a daily rhythm of bottom activities, with surfacing activities more frequent during the night and early in the morning. More investigation into those cycles and other individual fine-scale behaviors related to their proximity to concentrations of human activity would be informative.

OBJECTIVE: To understand patient characteristics, dosing, adherence, and persistence related to high-dose insulin therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that used administrative claims from a large national health plan. Patients were identified who had been diagnosed with T2DM and who were aged 18-89 years, enrolled in a commercial or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan, newly initiated on a total daily dose (TDD) >200 units of insulin between January 2011 and August 2015. Patients were required to be enrolled 6 months before and 12 months after the index date. Patients were categorized to Regimen-100 if treated with U-100 insulin only or Regimen-500 if treated with U-500R with or without U-100. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. An adjustment factor for the days supply was calculated as the ratio of median time between insulin claims, and median pharmacy reported days supply for each insulin prescription. Adjusted days supply, quantity, and concentration were used to calculate TDD for each quarter after the index date. Adherence was measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC) for each regimen. Persistence was measured in 2 ways: the percentage of patients remaining on index medications in each quarter and the proportion of patients who maintained TDD >200 units during all 4 quarters of the 12-month post-index period. RESULTS: We identified 2,339 patients newly titrated up to TDD >200 units on either Regimen-100 (2,062, 88.2%) or Regimen-500 (277, 11.8%). Patients on Regimen-500 were slightly younger with higher prevalence of comorbidities. The mean TDD (SD) for Regimen-100 decreased from 228.6 (36.0) units during the first quarter to 194.2 (181.4) units during the last quarter. The mean TDD (SD) for Regimen-500 increased from 294.2 (102.2) units in the first quarter to 304.8 (281.6) units in last quarter. The average adherence to the high-dose insulin regimen was 68.2% (30.7; median 72.6%) for the Regimen-100 cohort and 75.5% (27.0; median 85.2%) for the Regimen-500 cohort. In the Regimen-100 and Regimen-500 cohorts, 45.3% and 55.2% had a PDC >= 80%, respectively. Only 23.0% and 51.6% of patients maintained TDD >200 units for the Regimen-100 and Regimen-500 cohorts, respectively, throughout the 4 quarters after the index date. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that many patients did not maintain high-dose insulin use over time, especially those on standard U-100 insulin only. This dosing pattern appears to reflect the differences in patient characteristics, insulin needs, and adherence/persistence behavior between those on Regimen-100 and those on Regimen-500.

The proposed TSTD system employs the ARQ scheme in which the receiver sends the acknowledgement signal (ACK or NACK) to the transmitter in order to predict the condition of the channel. For the ARQ-aided TSTD system, the proposed antenna switching pattern triggers the transmit antenna switches. Simulation results demonstrate that the performances of the TSTD systems can be improved by applying the ARQ scheme. Furthermore, the performances of ARQ-aided TSTD systems may be significantly improved by applying the proposed antenna switching scheme, especially when the mobile speed is low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4244-5123-4;;;;2009;;;;;;;2395;2398;;10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449879;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449879;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000305824602082;

Cell specific reference signals are however always allocated for the transmission of common control signalling, mobility measurements and downlink channel quality measurements. In order to save the resources occupied by UE specific reference signals, and to simplify UE implementation, a precoder-estimation scheme and a codebook-assisted scheme are designed.

Cell clustering is one of these methods, where cells are organized in clusters. Inside each cluster, cells shall have the same frame configuration.

In particular, the trip distance distribution (TDD) is a direct input to the bathtub model in the new space dimension, and is a very important variable to consider in many applications, such as the development of distance-based congestion pricing strategies or mileage tax. For a good understanding of the demand pattern, both the distribution of trip initiation and trip distance should be calibrated from real data. In this paper, it is assumed that the demand pattern can be described by the joint distribution of trip distance and departure time. In other words, TDD is assumed to be time-dependent, and a calibration and validation methodology of the joint probability is proposed, based on log-likelihood maximization and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The calibration method is applied to empirical for-hire vehicle trips in Chicago, and it is concluded that TDD varies more within a day than across weekdays. The hypothesis that TDD follows a negative exponential, log-normal, or Gamma distribution is rejected. However, the best fit is systematically observed for the time-dependent log-normal probability density function. In the future, other trip distributions should be considered and also non-parametric probability density estimation should be explored for a better understanding of the demand pattern.;;;;;Jin, Wen-Long/F-3241-2012;"Jin, Wen-Long/0000-0002-5413-8377; Martinez, Irene/0000-0002-3052-4791";;;;;;;;;;;;;0361-1981;2169-4052;;;;NOV;2021;2675;11;;;;;915;934;3611981211021550;10.1177/03611981211021552;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03611981211021552;;JUL 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000683444200001;

This article presents a new method to evaluate the TDD's optical performance by the output luminous flux. The method is using position (alpha, d) and angular distribution of luminous flux (phi, theta, Phi) information to describe the optical properties of the TDD's light collecting cover. With the optical information, the ray tracing simulates the output luminous flux basing on the structural and reflectivity of the light pipe.

We discussed the thin film formation mechanism and improvement of feature edge acuity through controlling the reactivity by changing functional groups of starting material and the surface functional groups of SAMs. The deposition of TiO2 from TC or TDD solution was promoted in the silanol group, and the deposition was suppressed on OTS (octadecyltrichloro-silane) SAM. On the other hand, TE was deposited regardless of the type of surface functional group in the whole area of patterned SAMs. The silanol group, which has high hydrophilicity, accelerated the growth of TiO2, and the OTS SAM, which has hydrophobicity, suppressed the growth of TiO2.

In this paper, we present a new feature extraction framework that aims to give an enhanced representation of muscular activities through increasing the amount of information that can be extracted from individual and combined electromyogram (EMG) channels. We propose to use time-domain descriptors (TDDs) in estimating the EMG signal power spectrum characteristics; a step that preserves the computational power required for the construction of spectral features. Subsequently, TDD is used in a process that involves: 1) representing the temporal evolution of the EMG signals by progressively tracking the correlation between the TDD extracted from each analysis time window and a nonlinearly mapped version of it across the same EMG channel and 2) representing the spatial coherence between the different EMG channels, which is achieved by calculating the correlation between the TDD extracted from the differences of all possible combinations of pairs of channels and their nonlinearly mapped versions. The proposed temporal-spatial descriptors (TSDs) are validated on multiple sparse and high-density (HD) EMG data sets collected from a number of intact-limbed and amputees performing a large number of hand and finger movements. Classification results showed significant reductions in the achieved error rates in comparison to other methods, with the improvement of at least 8% on average across all subjects. Additionally, the proposed TSDs achieved significantly well in problems with HD-EMG with average classification errors of <5% across all subjects using windows lengths of 50 ms only.";;;;;"Al-Jumaily, Adel/A-5301-2014; Al-Timemy, Ali H/A-6974-2011; Khushaba, Rami/O-1038-2015; AL-JUMAILY, Adel/GWV-7638-2022";"Al-Jumaily, Adel/0000-0003-0297-2463; Khushaba, Rami/0000-0001-8528-8979; AL-JUMAILY, Adel/0000-0003-0297-2463; H.

We analyze the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) outage performance of a D-TDD fixed cellular system, and propose a scheme to improve the outage probability performance. First, outage probability is evaluated using an analytical model, when omnidirectional antennas are deployed at a base-station site and a subscriber site. Our model is verified, using Monte Carlo simulations. According to our investigation, the outage performance of the D-TDD system is severely limited by a strong interference from the cochannel cell on the downlink, while the reference cell is in the uplink cycle. To improve the outage performance during uplink receptions, we introduce two time-slot allocation methods, combined with sector antennas: the Max Min{SIR} and Max{SIR}. The Max Min{SIR} is an exhaustive search algorithm for assigning subscribers to a few extra uplink time slots, so as to maximize the minimum SIR expectation value over the extra uplink time-slots region. It is used as a performance benchmark in our analysis. Meanwhile, the Max{SIR} is a simpler and efficient algorithm for improving the outage performance. It is established that the performance difference between the two algorithms is not noticeable. Especially, the difference is negligible, when the dynamic range of the traffic pattern between uplink and downlink is small. Also, the outage performance of a system that employs the Max{SIR} algorithm combined with sectored antennas is compared to that of a system employing adaptive-array antennas. The proposed system shows promise, and offers a compromise between system complexity and network guaranteed availability.;;;;;Kavehrad, Mohsen/AAJ-1958-2021;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0090-6778;;;;;OCT;2002;50;10;;;;;1627;1636;;10.1109/TCOMM.2002.803991;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.803991;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000179170400013;

This architecture is motivated from the network system requirements, especially single-hop distance and jamming-resilience requirements. It is shown that the power consumption of current-day Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) limits the channel bandwidth that can be used, both for a baseband processing system and the scanning system. We therefore propose to use a form of Frequency Hopping Time Division Multiplexing (FH/TDD) system, similar to Bluetooth. However, we propose to use OFDM as modulation scheme instead of GFSK and show that the OFDM symbol length for the frequency range at hand (400 - 1000 MHz) is consistent with a Bluetooth-alike FH/TDD scheme. We propose to modify the FH/TDD scheme to incorporate a radio-spectrum measurement phase. Based on these measurements carriers in the OFDM-based scheme are selected in such a fashion that legacy users are avoided. In case of too much legacy-user spectral usage hopping patterns may be altered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1-4244-0013-9;;;;2005;;;;;;;577;584;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000234539500061;

The full width at half maximum values of (0002) and (10 (1) over bar2) X-ray diffraction rocking curves of the ELOG AlN layer on the nano-net-patterned AlN template are 76 and 306 arcsec, and the values of that on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template are 114 and 357 arcsec, respectively. Nevertheless, the threshold power density (P-th) of the 272-nm lasing from the multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template is 11% lower than that on the nanonet-patterned AlN template. The reason is that the continuous low threading dislocation density (TDD) MQWs zones above the ELOG coalescent areas upon trenched patterns are in parallel with the stimulated light emission direction. When light resonates through the continuous low TDD MQWs zones, it has higher optical gain and less non-radiative recombination than the case on the nano-net-patterned AlN template where the low TDD MQWs zones are discontinuous on the light path. The results indicate that not only the crystal quality but also the TDD distribution originated from the ELOG on the patterned templates have crucial influence on the P-th, and trench-patterned template can improve the performance of waveguide LDs with Fabry-Perot cavities.

The higher the Ga content in these layers is, the stronger is the influence of the surface morphology on their properties. For x = 0.5 not only periodic inhomogeneities in the Al content due to growth of Ga-rich facets are observed by cathodoluminescence, but these facets give rise to additional dislocation formation as discovered by annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. For AlxGa1-xN layers with x = 0.8 the difference in Al content between facets and surrounding material is much smaller. Therefore, the threading dislocation density (TDD) is only defined by the TDD in the underlying epitaxially laterally overgrown (ELO) AlN layer.

In Release 18, 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) will take another step on extending IAB capabilities. With mobile IAB (mIAB), IAB nodes can be deployed within vehicles, e.g., buses. As in every new technology, performance assessment and evaluation of the impact of interference is of interest for industry and academia. In this paper, we present contributions on those topics. First, we evaluate the performance of mIAB compared to fiber-connected deployments. Moreover, we study the impact of interference on the performance of mIAB networks and propose a solution based on inserting silent slots on the time division duplex (TDD) frame pattern. According to our simulation results, mIAB is capable of improving performance of onboard user equipments (UEs) without harming too much the quality of service (QoS) of surrounding UEs. Furthermore, we show that the TDD frame pattern should be carefully designed to account for scenarios with different levels of interference.;;;;;"Monteiro, Victor Farias/T-3022-2019; Ferreira Maciel, Tarcisio/M-7667-2013";"Monteiro, Victor Farias/0000-0002-6462-4686; Ferreira Maciel, Tarcisio/0000-0002-8861-1708";;;;;;;;;;;;;2334-0983;2576-6813;978-1-6654-3540-6;;;;2022;;;;;;;5153;5158;;10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001454;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001454;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000922633505033;

In the current SRS pattern scheme, because SRSs of up to eight users are multiplexed on the same time-frequency resources, there exist mutual interferences among these SRSs over fading channels. Thus, the current scheme impacts the estimation accuracy of CSI and degrades the beamforming performance. Based on the characteristics of TDD systems, the authors propose a SRS pattern scheme, in which each user sends SRSs only on the allocated bandwidth instead of on full bandwidth as in the current LTE TDD systems, to eliminate the interferences among SRSs. Simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the current scheme in the estimation accuracy for various frequency-selective and time-selective fading channels. In addition, compared with the current SRS pattern scheme, the proposed SRS pattern scheme is robust to frequency-selective channels, and does not be impacted by the timing offset, and provides the flexibility for the choice of channel estimator at the BS side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1751-8628;1751-8636;;;;MAY;2012;6;7;;;;;774;782;;10.1049/iet-com.2011.0435;http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-com.2011.0435;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000305296500012;

This method combines the effects of sub-100 nm nucleation and multistep lateral growth by using a low-cost but unique carbon nanotube mask, which consists of nanoscale growth windows with a quasi-periodic 2D fill factor. It is found that GM-NHE can facilely reduce threading dislocation density (TDD) and modulate residual stress on foreign substrate without any regrowth.

Study endpoints were HbA1c value, rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis events, and growth patterns. Mean HbA1c for the total duration of diabetes (HbA1c-TDD) was 7.9 +/- A 0.8%. Comparison of the study variables between patients with HbA1c-TDD < 7.5% (n = 53) or a parts per thousand yen7.5% yielded a significantly shorter duration of diabetes (P = 0.01) and lower rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (P = 0.02) in those with HbA1C-TDD < 7.5%, without differences between these groups in age at diabetes onset, insulin regimens, daily glucose measurements, and rate of severe hypoglycemia. Factors significantly predicting achievement of the mean target HbA1c-TDD < 7.5% were lower HbA1c at 0.5 years and 1 year after diabetes diagnosis (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). Patients followed for at least 5 years (n = 48) showed a significant decrease in height-SDS (P < 0.001) and a significant increase in weight-SDS (P = 0.004) from diabetes diagnosis to the last follow-up visit, without a significant change in weight-SDS from 0.5 years after diagnosis to the last follow-up visit. Our results suggest that in patients with T1D diagnosed during the preschool-age, mean HbA1c level in the first year is a strong predictor of achieving target HbA1c level in the subsequent years, regardless the type of insulin regimen. This metabolic tracking emphasizes the importance of achieving early optimal control even in younger children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0940-5429;1432-5233;;;;OCT;2012;49;5;;;;;355;362;;10.1007/s00592-011-0321-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00592-011-0321-x;;;;;;;;21866397;;;;;WOS:000309545800005;

Besides, these services are shifting from dominant Downlink (DL) Traffic to a more equilibrate DL/UpLink (UL) and dominant UL traffic for specific emerging services. One option to accommodate this new behavior is to use Time Duplex Division (TDD), where the radio frame is shared between UL and DL time slots, namely UL/DL pattern. While 4G TDD has a fixed number of configurations that cannot be updated on runtime, SGNR allows complete flexibility to define the UL/DL pattern. Therefore, 5G base stations can dynamically change the pattern to adapt to the type of traffic (i.e., UL or DL). However, the 5G standard does not specify algorithms or solutions to derive the UL/DL pattern. To fill this gap, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that adds intelligence to the base station to self-adapt to the traffic pattern of the cell type. The proposed DRL algorithm monitors UL and DL buffers at the 5G base station to derive the optimal UL/DL pattern in respect to the current traffic configuration. The proposed solution delivers the optimal configuration in a timely and efficient manner. Simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to avoid buffer overflow and ensure the generality by reacting to traffic pattern changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2334-0983;2576-6813;978-1-7281-8104-2;;;;2021;;;;;;;;;;10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685820;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685820;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000790747204058;

Soil is a huge C reservoir and its storage potential varies greatly with forest types. Therefore, in the present study, the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage pattern was assessed from 70 plots laid at three selected forest types comprising seven study sites at Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India: tropical dry deciduous (TDD I and TDD II), tropical semi-evergreen (TSE I and TSE II) and tropical evergreen forest (TEF I, TEF II and TEF III) at three depths (0-10, 10.1-20 and 20.1-30 cm). Statistical analyses were performed to understand the relationships between SOC stocks with other predictor variables. The SOC stock varied markedly with forest type and site-wise. The SOC ranged from 58 (TEF III) to 123.6 (TDD I) Mg C/ha with a mean of 84.9 +/- 4.4 Mg C/ha at 0-30 cm depth. SOC stock decreased, while soil bulk density increased with increase in soil depth. The TDD forest type (115.6 Mg C/ha) stocked the highest SOC compared to TEF (75.1 Mg C/ha) and TSE (68.9 Mg C/ha) forest types. Of the total SOC stock (0-30 cm), 44.2, 32.0 and 23.8% were stored in 0-10, 10.1-20 and 20.1-30 cm respectively in all the forest types. In contrast, litter C stock were high in TEF and TSE forest types and low in TDD forest type. SOC showed significant (P < 0.01) negative relationships with bulk density, litter C, and vegetation attributes. The SOC stock stored in the study sites amount to 212.9 (TEF III) to 453.6 (TDD I) Mg of CO2 equivalents. The present study reveals that forest type and site characteristics have a profound impact on SOC stock, which would, in turn, exert a great bearing on the ecosystem C cycling. These results would also enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forest types in soil C sequestration and for developing and validating SOC models for tropical forest ecosystems.;;;;;"Kothandaraman, Subashree/ADW-9318-2022; Dar, Javid Ahmad/J-4985-2012; Dar, Javid Ahmad/FBU-2730-2022";"Kothandaraman, Subashree/0000-0002-7940-7705; Dar, Javid Ahmad/0000-0002-2018-8376; Dar, Javid Ahmad/0000-0002-2018-8376; somaiah, sundarapandian/0000-0001-7860-091X";;;;;;;;;;;;;0167-6369;1573-2959;;;;NOV;2019;191;11;;;;;;;690;10.1007/s10661-019-7881-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7881-6;;;;;;;;31664599;;;;;WOS:000499199400009;

Using photolithography and dry etching, an array of submicron-wide strips with a rectangular cross-section is patterned in the [110] direction of a Si (001) wafer. A Ge film as thick as 1 mu m is grown on the patterned Si by chemical vapor deposition with an ordinary two-step growth method, where a buffer layer of pure Ge as thin as 50 nm is grown at a low temperature of 370 degrees C, followed by growth at an elevated temperature of 700 degrees C. A Ge film is formed with a reasonably flat surface despite the non-flat starting Si surface as well as the large lattice mismatch of 4.2% between Ge and Si. The etch-pit density measurements for the Ge film exhibits TDD of about 6 x 10(7) cm(-2), which is significantly lower than that of about 2 x 10(8) cm(-2) for the film on the unpatterned region prepared on the same Si substrate. The TDD reduction is attributed to a trapping of the dislocations in the trench regions between the Si strips, as observed in cross-sectional transmission electron microscope images.;;;;;Ishikawa, Yasuhiko/L-8874-2014;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0361-5235;1543-186X;;;;AUG;2023;52;8;;;SI;;5059;5065;;10.1007/s11664-023-10302-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11664-023-10302-3;;MAR 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000945292400002;

The ordered structure is metastable in the bulk, so any glissile dislocation that disrupts the ordered pattern will release stored energy, and experience an increased glide force. Here we show how this connection between atomic ordering and dislocation glide force can be exploited to control the threading dislocation density (TDD) in GaxIn1-xP CGBs. When ordered GaxIn1-xP is graded from the GaAs lattice constant to InP, the order parameter eta decreases as x decreases, and dislocation glide switches from one set of glide planes to the other. This glide plane switch (GPS) is accompanied by the nucleation of dislocations on the new glide plane, which typically leads to increased TDD. We develop control of the GPS position within a GaxIn1-xP CGB through manipulation of deposition temperature, surfactant concentration, and strain-grading rate. We demonstrate a two-stage GaxIn1-xP CGB from GaAs to InP with sufficiently low TDD for high performance devices, such as the 4-junction inverted metamorphic multi-junction solar cell, achieved through careful control the GPS position. Experimental results are analyzed within the context of a model that considers the force balance on dislocations on the two competing glide planes as a function of the degree of ordering.;;;;;Norman, Andrew G/F-1859-2010;"Norman, Andrew G/0000-0001-6368-521X; Schulte, Kevin/0000-0003-4273-6254; France, Ryan/0000-0002-2040-4809; Geisz, John/0000-0003-4818-653X; Guthrey, Harvey/0000-0003-1574-3379";;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-0248;1873-5002;;;;APR 15;2017;464;;;;;;20;27;;10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.11.050;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.11.050;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000398873500005;

This is, however, a very challenging problem. Although on the large scale, the wind speed is related to atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other meteorological variables, no improvement in forecasting accuracy was found by incorporating air pressure and temperature directly into an advanced space-time statistical forecasting model, the trigonometric direction diurnal (TDD) model. This paper proposes to incorporate the geostrophic wind as a new predictor in the TDD model. The geostrophic wind captures the physical relationship between wind and pressure through the observed approximate balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis acceleration due to the Earth's rotation. Based on our numerical experiments with data from West Texas, our new method produces more accurate forecasts than does the TDD model using air pressure and temperature for 1-to 6-hour-ahead forecasts based on three different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, forecasting errors can be further reduced by using moving average hourly wind speeds to fit the diurnal pattern. For example, our new method obtains between 13.9% and 22.4% overall mean absolute error reduction relative to persistence in 2-hour-ahead forecasts, and between 5.3% and 8.2% reduction relative to the best previous space-time methods in this setting.;;;;;Bowman, Kenneth P/A-1345-2012;"Bowman, Kenneth P/0000-0002-2667-8632; Genton, Marc Georges/0000-0001-6467-2998";;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-6157;;;;;SEP;2014;8;3;;;;;1782;1799;;10.1214/14-AOAS756;http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/14-AOAS756;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000347529300021;

Our approach enables to interpret the advanced antenna systems (AAS) coverage and massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) spatial resolution, by the inspection of the array resultant multiple beams. Particularly, the impact on the mMIMO spatial resolution is conducted as a function of the channel correlation, by means of an exclusively radiofrequency (RF) approach, with the advantage of not considering the system-level features, and using a new figure of merit ( $\Lambda $ factor). The new figure of merit enables to evaluate the antenna array diversity from two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) beamforming, by computing the number of lobes with gain higher than a unique element. In the 3D case, the figure of merit is based on a differential calculation, which enables performing an infinitesimal counting of lobes per antenna element beamwidth. Such parameter is initially applied to a theoretical dipole-based array, with the purpose of quantifying the created multiple beams by the overlapped radiation patterns from mMIMO systems. Furthermore, the $\Lambda $ factor is exploited for analyzing the performance of a 64-element and dual-polarized SICL-based slot antenna array and a 64-element dipole-based antenna prototypes, both previously developed by our research group. Finally, it is demonstrated that the $\Lambda $ factor increases as diversity increases and dipole-based antenna array could be used as an upper limit, attaining 11.46 lobes/rad;;;;;Cerqueira Sodre Junior, Arismar/O-5426-2018;"Cerqueira Sodre Junior, Arismar/0000-0002-5659-4165; Filgueiras, Hugo Rodrigues Dias/0000-0003-0121-0571; Melo Pereira, Luiz Augusto/0000-0001-5731-5351";;;;;;;;;;;;;;2637-6431;;;;;2023;4;;;;;;294;302;;10.1109/OJAP.2023.3252047;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OJAP.2023.3252047;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000952904000002;

It is increasingly dear that tumor growth depends on both internal tumor factors, and factors that are external to the tumor, such as microenvironment. We recently showed that parameter values alone are less important than the patterns of all patient parameters together for the identification of prognostic subtypes and have identified a network phenotyping strategy method to quantitatively describe the dependency of the tumor on the environment, to characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtypes. We have also shown that information about tumor mass together with patterns of other prognostic factors is related to survival. We now use a different patient cohort to validate this prognostic approach. A main finding is our identification of a common time of total disease duration (MD) for every HCC patient. Clinical prognosis at the time of baseline patient evaluation is then calculable as the difference between TDD and the time from disease onset to diagnosis (T-onset). We show that the total pattern of all parameter values and the differences in the relationships between this pattern and a reference pattern that, together with the tumor mass, best reflects the patient's prognosis at baseline. Our approach led us to identify 15 different composite HCC subtypes. Our results highlight the nearly identical TDD in all patients, which must therefore be a characteristic of the HCC disease, as opposed to the variable quantity of T-onset, which is impacted by multiple macro- and micro-environmental factors.

In recent years, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the performance of AlGaN-based DUV LEDs on sapphire substrates have increased markedly due to improvements in the crystalline-quality of high Al-content AlGaN layers, and the optimization of LED structures. On the other hand, DUV LEDs fabricated on Si substrates are very promising as a low-cost DUV light-source in the near future. However, AlN layers on Si have suffered from cracking induced by the large mismatch in lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients between AlN and Si. In this paper, DUV LEDs on Si were realized by a combination of a reduction in the number of cracks and of the threading dislocation density (TDD) of AlN templates by using the epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) method. The ELO-AlN templates were successfully coalesced on trench-patterned substrates, with the stripes running along the < 1-100 > direction of AlN. The density of cracks was greatly reduced in 4-mu m-thick ELO-AlN templates, because voids formed by the ELO process relaxed the tensile stress in the AlN layer. Furthermore, the AlN templates showed low-TDD. The full-width-at-half-maximum values of the (0002) and (10-12) X-ray rocking curves were 780 and 980 arcsec, respectively. DUV LEDs fabricated on these high-quality ELO-AlN/Si substrates showed single peak emission at 256-278 nm in electroluminescence measurements. It is expected that we will be able to realize low-cost DUV LEDs on Si substrates by using ELO-AlN templates.;;;;;Hirayama, Hideki/B-9830-2015;Hirayama, Hideki/0000-0003-1253-6278;;;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;1996-756X;978-0-8194-9394-1;;;;2013;8625;;;;;;;;86251Q;10.1117/12.2002322;http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2002322;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000329526900033;

Traffic demand shows variability and complexity under comprehensive land-use patterns. Accurate analysis of traffic demand in urban transportation is the key to active traffic control and road guidance. Researchers have widely studied the relationship between traffic demand and land-use patterns, while land-use intensity is ignored when classifying land-use patterns, and the traffic demand distribution in each land-use pattern is not studied specifically. Taxi is a flexible public mode in urban areas, and taxi demand is an important component in analyzing traffic demand and identifying traffic hotspots in cities. This paper explores taxi demand distribution of comprehensive land-use patterns using online car-hailing data and points of interest (POI) in Chengdu, China. The demand-driven traffic analysis zones are developed by clustering origin-destination points of online car-hailing services. Using POI data, comprehensive land-use patterns are classified with land-use forms and land-use intensity. The K-shape algorithm is adopted to extract the typical taxi demand distribution in each comprehensive land-use pattern. Finally, two indicators, total taxi demand (TTD) and taxi demand difference (TDD), are computed and further analyzed. Results show that taxi demand distribution is still differential even under the same land-use pattern. Three land-use patterns whose average hourly taxi demand reaches about 300 vehicles per square kilometer have the largest TTD and most uneven TDD. The findings can support traffic management, land-use combination, and land-use adjustment to avoid concentrated taxi demand and mismatched TDD.;;;;;"Yu, Weijie/ITU-3183-2023; Wang, Xinhua/ISR-8520-2023";Yu, Weijie/0000-0002-7774-0109;;;;;;;;;;;;;0361-1981;2169-4052;;;;OCT;2021;2675;10;;;;;1268;1286;3611981211015260;10.1177/03611981211015259;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03611981211015259;;OCT 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000712153200001;

However, the MNs with larger height are required to overcome the skin barrier for effective TDD. Unlike 2D patterning, etching polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) micropillars for fabrication of 3D microstructures is presented. The PDMS micropillars were first constructed by casting PDMS on the computer numerical control-machined cylindrical microwells, which then went through etching process to obtain the MNs for subsequent fabrication of polymer MNs or high aspect ratio micropillars.

Shortest Traveling Routes with high congestion grievously affect the driving comfort level of VANET users in populated cities. As a result, increase in journey time and traveling cost. Predicting the most favorable traveling routes with less congestion is imperative to minimize the driving inconveniences. A major downside of existing traveling route prediction models is to continuously learn the real-time road congestion data with static benchmarking datasets. However, learning the new information with already learned data is a cumbersome task. The main idea of this paper is to utilize incremental learning on the Hybrid Learning-based traffic Congestion and Timing Prediction (HL-CTP) to select realistic, congestion-free, and shortest traveling routes for the vehicles. The proposed HL-CTP model is decomposed into three steps: dataset construction, incremental and hybrid prediction model, and route selection. Firstly, the HL-CTP constructs a novel Traffic and Timing Dataset (TTD) using historical traffic congestion information. The incremental learning method updates the novel real-time data continuously with the TDD during prediction to optimize the performance efficiency of the hybrid prediction model closer to real-time. Secondly, the hybrid prediction model with various deep learning models performs better by taking the route prediction decision based on the best sub-predictor results. Finally, the HL-CTP selects the most favorable vehicle routes selected using traffic congestion, timing, and uncertain environmental information and enhances the comfort level of VANET users. In the simulation, the proposed HL-CTP demonstrates superior performance in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).;;;;;Kounte, Manjunath/O-2374-2018;Kounte, Manjunath/0000-0002-2432-2552;;;;;;;;;;;;;1407-6160;1407-6179;;;;NOV 1;2022;23;4;;;;;293;310;;10.2478/ttj-2022-0024;http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ttj-2022-0024;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000884899200003;

Furthermore, TDD was significantly reduced to 6.8 x 10(5) cm(-2). These results indicate that the hexagonal mask technique is effective for improving both lattice curvature and crystalline quality of a GaN substrate.

This technique requires amputees to provide sufficient EMG signals to decode their limb movement intentions (LMIs). However, amputees with neuromuscular disorder/high level amputation often cannot provide sufficient EMG control signals, and thus the applicability of the EMG-PR technique is limited especially to this category of amputees. As an alternative approach, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals recorded non-invasively from the brain have been utilized to decode the LMIs of humans. However, most of the existing EEG based limb movement decoding methods primarily focus on identifying limited classes of upper limb movements. In addition, investigation on EEG feature extraction methods for the decoding of multiple classes of LMIs has rarely been considered. Therefore, 32 EEG feature extraction methods (including 12 spectral domain descriptors (SDDs) and 20 time domain descriptors (TDDs)) were used to decode multiple classes of motor imagery patterns associated with different upper limb movements based on 64-channel EEG recordings. From the obtained experimental results, the best individual TDD achieved an accuracy of 67.05 +/- 3.12% as against 87.03 +/- 2.26% for the best SDD. By applying a linear feature combination technique, an optimal set of combined TDDs recorded an average accuracy of 90.68% while that of the SDDs achieved an accuracy of 99.55% which were significantly higher than those of the individual TDD and SDD at p < 0.05. Our findings suggest that optimal feature set combination would yield a relatively high decoding accuracy that may improve the clinical robustness of MDoF neuroprosthesis.;;;;;Samuel, Oluwarotimi Williams/AAE-6996-2020;"Samuel, Oluwarotimi Williams/0000-0003-1945-1402; Li, Guanglin/0000-0001-9016-2617";;;;;;;;;;;;;0148-5598;1573-689X;;;;DEC;2017;41;12;;;;;;;;10.1007/s10916-017-0843-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10916-017-0843-z;;;;;;;;29080913;;;;;WOS:000414001400001;

However, cracking of AIN films during annealing is a critical issue. In this study, we controlled the residual stress of the sputter-deposited AIN films by modifying the sputtering conditions. Consequently, the occurrence of cracking was effectively suppressed. By optimizing the fabricating conditions, a TDD of 2.07 x 10(8) cm(-2) was achieved for the AIN template with a thickness of 480 nm.

SAMs of OTS (octadecyltrichloro-silane) were formed on Si wafers, and were modified by UV irradiation using a photomask to generate methyl/silanol-pattem. They were used as templates to deposit titanium dioxide thin films by the use of TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide). Amorphous films with approximate compositions Ti/O/CI/C = 1:2.2:0.17:0.37 were selectively deposited on silanol regions. Line width variation of the pattern of an as-deposited film was improved to be well below the electronics design rule, 5%. Annealing the films at high temperatures (400-600 degreesC) gave rise to an anatase phase, while the resolution of a micropattern remained unchanged. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimators are investigated with three categories of pilots, namely regular pilots (RPs), time-superimposed (or superimposed) pilots and staggered pilots (StP). Two patterns of frequency reuse (FR) per category are used. The simulation results showed that by increasing the number of BS antennas with a fixed number of symbols dedicated to the UL phase and vice versa, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the LS and MMSE estimators using the superimposed pilot (SuP) or StP is asymptotically approaches the NMSE of the LS and MMSE estimators using the RP, respectively. An asymptotic behavior is studied for two different FR scenarios.;;;;;"BOULOUIRD, Mohamed/B-5863-2014; AMADID, JAMAL/ABA-3968-2022";"BOULOUIRD, Mohamed/0000-0002-9656-6433; AMADID, JAMAL/0000-0002-6158-069X";;;;;;;;;;;;;2190-3018;2190-3026;"978-981-16-3637-0; 978-981-16-3636-3";;;;2022;237;;;;;;161;176;;10.1007/978-981-16-3637-0_12;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-3637-0_12;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000866307400012;

Spectroscopic ellipsometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveal a perfect crystalline quality of epitaxial germanium layers on (100) c-Ge wafers.

Defects rising from Ge/Si interface are mostly located within the first tens of nanometers, and threading dislocation density (TDD) values as low as 10(6) cm(-2) are obtained. Misfit stress is released fast: residual strain of -0.4% is calculated from Moire pattern analysis. Moreover we demonstrate a striking feature of low temperature plasma epitaxy, namely the fact that crystalline quality improves with thickness without epitaxy breakdown, as shown by TEM and depth profiling of surface TDD.

The proposed approach relies on a flexible service-oriented slicing considering diverse applications with heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) demands in terms of throughput, latency, etc. It introduces a separate and customized Uplink/Downlink (UL/DL) pattern per slice taking into account the desired Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is mapped on to a QoS policy for facilitating slicing of the radio access resources. Such a QoS policy allows the flexible allocation of Resource Blocks (RBs) considering the entire spectrum for individual services, while a dynamic resource variation additionally allocates temporarily unused RBs to particular slices in need. The end-to-end system aspects considering the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network orchestration and management architecture are also discussed and an exhaustive simulation campaign is conducted to validate our proposals against the current state-of-the-art.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2334-0983;;978-1-5386-4727-1;;;;2018;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000465774301055;

Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 97 852 patients from 11 Asian countries/regions (2007-2017) included in the prospective Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register. Results Among 18 998 insulin users (47% women, mean +/- SD age 59.2 +/- 11.7 years, diabetes duration 13.2 +/- 8.3 years, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 72 +/- 21.4 mmol/mol [8.74 +/- 1.95%], median total daily insulin dose [TDD] 0.27-0.82 units/kg), 25% and 29.5% had YOD and DKD, respectively. Premixed (44%) and basal-only (42%) insulin were the most common regimens. Despite being more commonly treated with these two regimens with higher insulin dosages, patients with YOD had worse HbA1c levels than their late-onset peers (73 +/- 20.5 vs. 71 +/- 21.2 mmol/mol [8.82 +/- 1.87% vs. 8.66 +/- 1.94%]; P < 0.001). Fewer women than men attained an HbA1c level < 53 mmol/mol (7%; 15.7% vs 17.1%; P = 0.018). Adjusting for age, diabetes duration, TDD, HbA1c, eGFR, and use of oral glucose-lowering drugs at baseline, the odds of self-reported hypoglycaemia were higher in women (vs. men: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.28) and in patients with DKD treated with a premixed regimen (1.81 [95% CI 1.54-2.13] vs. 1.34 [95% CI 1.16-1.54] in non-DKD; P-interaction < 0.001). Compared to basal-only regimens, premixed and basal-bolus regimens had similar HbA1c reductions but were independently associated with increased odds of hypoglycaemia (1.65 [95% CI 1.45-1.88] and 1.88 [95% CI 1.58-2.23], respectively).

We propose a deep learning method to design the codebook for limited feedback. The learned codebook is distinguished from the traditional ones in two ways. First, the learned codebook is so-called personalized, which is not fixed but adapt to the partially known CSIT.

First, the standard crystallographic parameters (i.e. the atomic positions which are most appropriate for bond formation); these give rise to the standard total difference density (TDD). Second, the shapes of degenerate atomic ground states appropriate for optimal interatomic interactions, giving rise to the novel chemical deformation density (CDD). Third, the genuine chemical deformation of the atoms in the molecule or crystal. This approach was applied to more than 40 molecules consisting mainly of second-row atoms (lithium to fluorine) and hydrogen. Contrary to the standard TDD, the novel CDD gives a very consistent pattern of covalent bond and lone pair densities, even for electron-rich atoms. The atomic shape parameters comprise valence atomic orbital directions and populations.

The novelty of this work lies in the use of silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates patterned into nano-pillars down to the buried oxide (BOX).

The aspect of the system we are focusing on is stability. For user scheduling for stability as a performance measure, both the queue and channel states need to be known by the base station. However channel states can be known only via feedback from the receivers. In order to collect CQI feedback from each user at one channel, a fraction of the available time for transmission is used. This means that the time left to transmit is getting smaller. We present a joint feedback and scheduling algorithm which can guarantee an expansion of the stability region with respect to prior works. We also provide expressions regarding the distribution of the time needed to be devoted for feedback at each channel in some special cases. The proposed algorithm does not need knowledge of the statistics of the channels and traffic patterns.

In particular, mechanical tilting can yield performance advancements that cannot be achieved by purely electronic steering, due to the presence of grating lobes and antenna pattern attenuations. In this letter, the performance of mmWave cellular systems is evaluated in terms of SINR when an adjacent-channel node is interfering with an (UL) transmission. We examine a mobile scenario complete with dynamic (TDD) and highlight how the optimization of the antenna tilt angle can drastically improve the overall network performance. Antenna down-tilt can be properly optimized according to both the environment and the antenna settings, thus reducing the overall interference level.

It produces directional BF by adjusting the weighted coefficient of each array element to obtain obvious array gain. At present, the most common BF algorithms are eigen-based Beamfirming (EBB) algorithm and grid of beam (GOB) algorithm, but these two algorithms still have some defects. Therefore, this paper thoroughly illustrates EBB and GOB algorithms and respectively presents the corresponding improvements. On the one hand, this article proposes a modified EBB algorithm which only adaptively changes phase pattern to reduce the impact on the amplitude of the original signal, thus decreases the power loss. On the other hand, this paper puts forward an improved GOB algorithm which adds the correlation factors of the antennas with different polarization at the same physical position to increase BF gain. The performances of improved and original BF algorithms are simulated in a platform of TD-LTE.

The role of the adaptive array in the canceller is to reduce co-channel interference (CCI) and long-delayed inter-symbol interference (ISI). Thus, the cascaded equalizer needs less complexity. In this paper, we propose to apply the canceller to the base station (BS) of a TDMA/TDD system and to reuse the receiving beam pattern in transmission. Then, in the down-link, the BS emits only the desired signal and short-delayed ISI for a desired mobile station (MS). As a result, with a simple equalizer in the MS, we can get a sufficient path diversity gain also in the down-link. The average bit error rate (BER) performance of the system in a Rayleigh fading channel is calculated by computer simulation. The results show that a sufficient path diversity gain is obtained in the down-link as well as in the up-link.;;;;;Ohgane, Takeo/A-5239-2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1090-3038;;0-7803-4320-4;;;;1998;;;;;;;2512;2516;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000075144500510;

The case of application considered is a UMTS/TDD transmission system for H263 compressed and turbo-coded video sequences. The overall redundancy added to the compressed stream is non-uniformly distributed between the succeeding video frames in order to minimize the mean distortion over the transmitted sequence. The repartition of the redundancy on the video stream is optimized using an analytical approach which aims to alleviate the error propagation along the sequence. Different puncturing patterns of the rate 1/3 turbo-coder were considered in our simulations. The results obtained here are compared to those with a classical equal error protection scheme. We demonstrate that the gain in the system performances can reach 1.5 dB (in terms of the mean peal, signal-to-noise ratio) without any significant increase in the transmission rate or the receiver complexity.

However, the GaN layers still contain a dislocation density of over 3 x 10(8)/cm(2) and stacking faults (SFs). To reduce such defects, we employed shallowly etched r-PSSs. The etching depths of the shallowly etched r-PSSs were from 100 to 500 nm, whereas that of a conventional r-PSS was 1 pm. As a result, we found that the threading dislocation density (TDD) decreases as the etching depth decreases. The TDD of the (11 221 GaN layer on r-PSS etched to a depth of 100 nm was 1.3 x 10(8)/cm(2). Moreover, the reduction of the SFs was observed by photoluminescence at cryogenic temperature.

A mismatch between the BLER and the target SIR usually results since the actual and assumed channel conditions are rarely the same. This mismatch tends to be especially large at very low BLERs. The OLPC depends on cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) and often takes a long time to converge to the required target SIR for low target BLERs. In this paper a channel-adaptive algorithm is presented that controls the target SIR for downlink transmission in WCDMA TDD. The proposed algorithm characterizes the multipalh channel profile using predefined multipath channel patterns and compensates for the channel/mapping errors. Link level simulations are conducted in various channel conditions defined by 3GPP and the ITU. The comparison in performance between the channel-adaptive algorithm and the generic jump algorithm is illustrated and conclusions are drawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1090-3038;;0-7803-7757-5;;;;2003;;;;;;;490;494;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000184835900101;

The method relies on the coalescence of GaN crystallites grown on top of a network of deformable pillars etched into a silicon-on-insulator substrate. Our approach takes advantage of the creeping properties of SiO2 at the usual GaN epitaxial growth temperature, allowing the GaN crystallites to align and reduce the grain boundary dislocations. Furthermore, this bottom-up approach allows to get rid of the dry plasma etching step for mu LEDs fabrication, which highly deteriorates sidewalls, reducing the efficiency of future displays.

The growth condition of the 3D-2D growth process is optimized to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD). It is found that the condition of the 3D layer is critical. The 3D layer keeps growing under the conditions of low V/III ratio, low temperature, and high pressure until its thickness is comparable to the height of the cone-shaped patterns. Then the 3D layer surrounds the cone-shaped patterns and has inclined side facets and a top (0001) plane. In the following 2D-growth process, inclined side facets coalesce quickly and the interaction of TDs with the side facets causes the TDs to bend over. As a result, the TDD of GaN films can decrease to 1 x 10(8) cm(-2), giving full-width at half maximum values of 211 and 219 arcsec for (002) and (102) omega scans, respectively.;;;;;"yuan, lin/JDW-7387-2023; Meng, Liang/GVT-1677-2022";Meng, Liang/0000-0002-2073-4322;;;;;;;;;;;;;1674-4926;;;;;NOV;2012;33;11;;;;;;;113002;10.1088/1674-4926/33/11/113002;http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1674-4926/33/11/113002;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000216680100005;

This study aimed to assess real-life ISF among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogs and to detect factors associated with ISF among those patients. MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted at Sohag University Hospital, Egypt, and included 93 participants aged 6-18 years, diagnosed with T1DM for at least 1 year and using insulin glargine 300 Units/mL or insulin degludec 100 Units/mL as basal insulin. The ISF, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) and insulin doses were initially assessed then adjusted as required. The participants were regularly contacted throughout the follow-up period. Glycemic control parameters were assessed after 3 months. ResultsThe ISF showed diurnal variation with higher correction dose requirements for the morning than for the rest of the day (p < 0.001). This pattern of diurnal variation was found in participants with different pubertal stages and in participants using either type of ultra-long acting basal insulin analogs. There was no significant difference between the ISF calculated according to the 1800 rule [1800/Total daily insulin dose (TDD)] and the morning ISF (p = 0.25). The 1800 rule-calculated ISF was significantly lower than the actual ISF for the afternoon (p < 0.001) and the evening (p < 0.001). ISF at different times of the day were significantly correlated with age, body mass index, pubertal stage, diabetes duration, TDD, and ICR. Multiple regression analysis revealed that ICR was the most significant factor associated with ISF. Linear regression analysis revealed that the ISF (in mg/dL) for any time of the day could be estimated as 5.14 x ICR for the same time of the day (coefficient = 5.14, 95% confidence interval: 5.10-5.19, R-2 = 0.95, p < 0.001). ConclusionDiurnal variation of ISF that had to be considered for proper calculation of correction doses. This diurnal variation was found in children and adolescents with different pubertal stages. The 1800 rule was appropriate for the morning correction doses but not in the afternoon or the evening. The TDD and the ICR could be used for ISF estimation.;;;;;Hegab, Ahmed/EIR-1444-2022;Hegab, Ahmed/0000-0002-1380-1398;;;;;;;;;;;;;2296-2360;;;;;MAR 8;2022;10;;;;;;;;854972;10.3389/fped.2022.854972;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.854972;;;;;;;;35350271;;;;;WOS:000798685700001;

In this paper, we present LensFD, a scalable method to enable cost-effective massive MIMO full-duplex operation in sub-6 GHz frequencies with a focus on the CBRS band of 3.5 GHz. LensFD uses a low-cost lens array combined with transmit precoding to reshape the effective beam pattern of antennas in massive MIMO arrays to reduce self-interference. We tested three lens configurations in LensFD experimentally with a software-defined 40-antenna base-station and demonstrate a significant improvement in self-interference reduction and hence overall increased system capacity to 1.6x over the TDD counterpart.

However the time and spatial reuse characteristics of RS should be taken into account in order to mitigate the co-channel interference. This paper presents two adaptive frequency reuse schemes for MRN by using different reuse patterns in different time zones of the same frame. In our schemes, reuse pattern of 1x3x1 is applied in the Relay Zone (RZ), and 1x3x3 is applied in the Access Zone (AZ). The former allows only the two RSs which are located farthest apart in one cell to share the same frequency portion; while in the latter two adjacent RSs may share the same resources. Analysis and simulation results show that both schemes improve the system throughput greatly. The comparison of coverage and throughput between the two schemes indicates that the latter scheme has better performance and an aggressive full reuse scheme could be utilized to all RSs.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-4244-6398-5;;;;2010;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000299203100016;

Specifically, optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) and direct model predictive control are employed so that the associated advantages of both, such as minimum stator current total demand distortion (TDD) and fast transients, respectively, are fully exploited. To do so, the current reference trajectory tracking and modulation problems are addressed in a coordinated manner in the form of a constrained optimization problem that utilizes the knowledge of the stator current evolution-as described by its gradient-within the prediction horizon. Solving this problem yields the optimal real-time modification of the offline-computed OPP, which guarantees that very low-and close to its theoretical minimum value-stator current TDD is produced at steady state, and very short settling times during transients. To highlight the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a variable speed drive system consisting of a three-level neutral point clamped inverter and an MV induction machine serves as a case study.;;;;;;"Karamanakos, Petros/0000-0002-6668-7701; Begh, Mirza Abdul Waris/0000-0002-4883-7470";;;;;;;;;;;;;0885-8993;1941-0107;;;;DEC;2022;37;12;;;;;14222;14236;;10.1109/TPEL.2022.3190708;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2022.3190708;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000849354800030;

In this paper, we propose a novel QoS guaranteed joint resource allocation framework for NR with supplementary uplink (SUL) called QGJRA-SUL, where three parameters of SUL admission, TDD pattern, and band slicing scheme are jointly optimized. The framework is driven by a well-designed deep reinforcement learning agent. By combining the activation functions tanh and softmax, the agent can jointly optimize three parameters at the same time. Under the original problem of QoS satisfaction rate maximization, we introduce the load unbalance degree of slices into the reward function as a penalty term. The simulation results show that the framework can guarantee the QoS satisfaction rate well and balance the load of slices. QGJRA-SUL can accommodate 15% more user equipments (UEs) with the same QoS satisfaction rate than that of a traditional single-band solution without SUL, and achieve a 73% increase in the performance of load balancing than that without a load balancing mechanism near the full load.;;;;;;"Huang, Yanyu/0000-0002-6936-3980; Zhang, Shunqing/0000-0002-5156-9235; Sun, Yanzan/0000-0003-3131-1760";;;;;;;;;;;;;;2079-9292;;;;APR;2023;12;7;;;;;;;1563;10.3390/electronics12071563;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics12071563;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000969635100001;

Most prior work on massive AMMO considers TDD operation that relies on channel reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels, whereas most current cellular systems adopt FDD without channel reciprocity. In an FDD mode, downlink channel estimation becomes a challenging issue due to the substantial training overhead that. scales with the number of antennas, which can limit the potential gain of massive MIMO systems. To tackle the issue of channel estimation, we consider the design of a training codebook that has a suitable mapping for the training signal patterns in block transmissions under the assumption of a Kalman filtering framework. We focus on a reduced dimensionality training codebook and transmit precoding design to enable low-complexity system configuration. We discuss how this framework can extend to hybrid analog-digital precoding using a limited number of active RF chains for transmit beamforming by applying the Toeplitz distribution theorem to large-scale linear antenna arrays.

The array apertures' design criteria are based on the effect of interference mitigation when using linear beamforming. The optimal solution is determined when the side lobes for the beams are minimized at different scanning angles in the field of view.

The investigation of the potential role of tdd genes has been extended here to tdd7 (SCO2367) and tdd13 (SCO4277). Both genes are highly expressed in bacteria grown in liquid-rich medium (tryptic soy broth). However, the deletion of these genes in S. coelicolor showed contrasting effects regarding developmental patterns, sporulation, and antibiotic production. Deletion of the tdd7 gene induced a reduction of growth in liquid medium, wrinkling of the mycelium on solid medium, and poor spore and actinorhodin production. On the other hand, deletion of the tdd13 gene did not significantly affect growth in liquid medium but induced a small colony phenotype on solid medium with abundant sporulation and overproduction of undecylprodigiosin. Although their exact functions remain undefined, the present data suggest a major involvement of TerD proteins in the proper development of S. coelicolor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0008-4166;1480-3275;;;;OCT;2012;58;10;;;;;1221;1229;;10.1139/w2012-101;http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/w2012-101;;;;;;;;23072443;;;;;WOS:000310451700009;

One straightforward way is to use open-loop and closed-loop uplink synchronization (ULS) control techniques to turn asynchronous uplink back to synchronous operation mode. The use of ULS control can greatly enhance bilateral data transmission throughput in both uplink and downlink channels of a mobile cellular as a direct result from improved transmission imparity between them. This is especially important for some applications where the traffic in the both links should be made equally high, such as video conferencing. This paper will also introduce a modeling method to analyze performance of ULS control in a mobile cellular system. It should be noted that, although this paper's study is carried out under the TD-SCDMA framework, the method can be equally applicable to any TDD-based 3G and 4C wireless systems that choose ULS control as the means to achieve isotropic air-link transmission. A numerical analysis based on propagation delay estimation will be used to derive probability of successful ULS control under consideration of the impact of different channel environments, such as reflection coefficients, propagation patterns, attenuation gradient and cell size, etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1550-2252;;0-7803-7954-3;;;;2003;;;;;;;2496;2500;;10.1109/VETECF.2003.1285983;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.2003.1285983;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000221662300505;

The NCPSS, with a hexagonal non-close-packed nano-cavity pattern on the sapphire substrate, was fabricated by polystyrene sphere coating and size reduction by reactive ion etching, followed by deposition of alumina and thermal oxidation. The coalescence of GaN on the NCPSS was achieved by the formation of relatively large GaN islands and enhanced lateral overgrowth of the GaN islands over several nano-cavity pattern areas. The threading dislocation density (TDD) measured by cathodoluminescence measurement was significantly reduced from 2.4x10(8) cm(-2) to 6.9x10(7) cm(-2) by using the NCPSS. A dislocation behavior that contributes to the reduction of TDD of the GaN layer was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the compressive stress in the GaN layer was reduced by 21% due to the embedded nano-cavities. In addition, the diffuse reflectance of GaN on the NCPSS was enhanced by 54%similar to 62%, which is attributed to the increased probability of light extraction through effective light scattering by nano-cavities.;;;;;"Kim, Jongmyeong/GXF-1293-2022; Oh, Jehong/AAS-1385-2020; Yoon, Euijoon/S-8957-2017";"Lee, Donghyun/0000-0002-8048-8581; Yoon, Euijoon/0000-0002-1802-0320";;;;;;;;;;;;;0022-0248;1873-5002;;;;FEB 1;2019;507;;;;;;103;108;;10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2018.11.001;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2018.11.001;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000455667500016;

High fill factor CNT films with easy accessibility are lifted above the sapphire patterns and introduce a second selective area growth subsequent to the micron-scale selective area growth on PSS, leading to a further reduction in threading dislocation density (TDD) without involving any regrowth process. Under this dislocation prevention effect, the TDD of the GaN epilayer dropped to 3.5 x 10(7) cm(-2) consequently, which is 78% lower than that on PSS. A thermal transporting network of CNTs with high axial thermal conductivity is simultaneously established, contributing to the great improvement in the thermal performance of the near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (LED) fabricated subsequently. As a result, an 89% increase in saturation light output power and a 55.5% enhancement in internal quantum efficiency were acquired.

In CPS-based monitoring applications, abnormal (including anomalies/outliers) values can lead to severe consequences for skewed judgments. The criteria for determining abnormal values may change over time, making it impossible to detect abnormal in real-time based on a training model or rely on traditional statistical methods to find abnormal values efficiently. When machine learning using, abnormal values in the data set are considered data errors or noise and excluded from analysis for the stability of the results. However, the identified abnormal values contain essential information in some cases, making correct navigation and identifying anomalies even more critical. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Dynamic Data Awareness (TDD-Awareness) algorithm that extracts the characteristics of continuous sensor data and accurately identifies abnormal values through the subsequent preprocessing process. The TDD-Awareness algorithm extracts the number of generated abnormally, the time of occurrence, and the characteristics and patterns needed to analyze the location of occurrence from the sensor data. The importance of abnormal values is determined by effectively exploring the relationship between abnormally to separate containing necessary information.";;;;;KIM, SVETLANA/JDW-0004-2023;Kim, Svetlana/0000-0002-9617-2610;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2192-1962;;;;MAR 30;2022;12;;;;;;;;13;10.22967/HCIS.2022.12.013;http://dx.doi.org/10.22967/HCIS.2022.12.013;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000775156000001;

This system, which will operate in the L frequency band (960 to 1164 MHz), would be internationally deployed from 2020. Many technologies were considered for this new aeronautical system but only two among them were preselected by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO): candidate one, named L-DACS1, is based on a FDD-OFDM technology and candidate two, named L-DACS2, is based on a TDD-GMSK technology. One of the most important issues for both candidates is the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with the legacy systems operating in the same band or/and in adjacent bands. Different scenarios have to be evaluated due to the fact that these systems will be implanted either in the airplanes (on board) or in ground stations. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the air-air scenario, where we focus on the signals generated by onboard L-DACS transmitters on onboard victim receivers, taking into account the L-DACS antenna radiation pattern and the frequency mask. The study emphasizes that the interference phenomenon can be one of the main limitations for the L-DACS development.;;;;;;De Lacerda, Raul/0000-0002-2167-1925;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;2009;;;;;;;243;+;;10.1109/ITST.2009.5399349;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2009.5399349;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000279343400046;

To investigate the effect of HPSS, the threading dislocation densities (TDDs) of AlN films grown simultaneously on HPSS and flat sapphire substrate (FSS) are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The corresponding TDD is measured to be 4.38 x 10(8) cm(-2) for the AlN sample grown on HPSS, which is significantly lower than the value of 1.48 x 10(9) cm(-2) on the FSS. The usability of the AlN/HPSS template for deep ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is proven by growth of AlGaN-based LED structure emitting at 278 nm with single peak emission in a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition reactor. The light output power of flip-chip LED grown and fabricated on AlN/HPSS template is enhanced by a factor of 1.25 when compared with LED on AlN/FSS template at 350 mA injecting current.

In this scenario, after the contention among the secondary nodes, the winner node transmits its data packet in the empty resource blocks (RBs) of downlink and uplink subframes of the primary network. Regarding the OFDMA structure as well as time-scheduled resources in the primary network, the time duration of opportunities for the secondary network does not follow simple exponential on-off pattern. To model the dynamic behavior of opportunities for secondary nodes as well as contentions to exploit the opportunities, we propose an analytical model comprised of a discrete-time Markov chain and two inter-related open multi-class queueing networks (QNs). The effects of the random number of empty resource blocks at different frames as the result of randomamount of download and upload data, random packet transmission time at WLAN, the dependency of the number of empty RBs at consecutive frames, and the details of 802.11 MAC protocol are included in our analytical approach.

Multiple-modulation of epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) is used to achieve high-quality GaN template on a novel serpentine channel patterned sapphire substrate (SCPSS). The dislocation blocking brought by the serpentine channel patterned mask, coupled with repeated dislocation bending, can reduce the dislocation density to a yet-to-be-optimized level of similar to 2 X 10(5) to 2 X 10(6) cm(-2). About 80% area utilization rate of GaN with low TDD and stress relaxation is obtained. The periodical variations of dislocation density, optical properties and residual stress in GaN-based epilayers on SCPSS are analyzed. The quantum efficiency of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on it can be increased by 52% compared with the conventional sapphire substrate. The reduced nonradiative recombination centers, the enhanced carrier localization, and the suppressed quantum confined Stark effect, are the main determinants of improved luminous performance in MQWs on SCPSS.

Currently, lateral resolutions down to only 30 mu m have been demonstrated for roll-to-roll (R2R)-compatible PEDOT:PSS printing. However, increasing lateral resolution of the printing technique can increase the complexity/ability of printed devices. Topographical discontinuous dewetting (TDD) and liquid-bridge transfer (LBT) is employed as a high-resolution, scalable, R2R-compatible patterning technique to fabricate PEDOT:PSS patterns with down to 400 nm lateral resolution and high thicknesses. PEDOT:PSS ink dispersions were prepared with water/ethanol/cosolvent mixtures to enable the TDD process and ensure high conductivity. After transfer by LBT to target substrates, an impressive average conductivity of 20.5 S cm(-1) was measured for the transferred PEDOT:PSS patterns without any post-transfer conductivity-enhancing treatments. Post-transfer conductivity-enhancing treatments were applied that are device fabrication-compatible (acid-free) with very high conductivities up to similar to 2590 S cm(-1) and average conductivity of similar to 1190 S cm(-1) for PEDOT:PSS lines patterns fabricated with 4.3% dimethylformamide (DMF) cosolvent. Interestingly, DMF cosolvent in the PEDOT:PSS ink dispersion formed higher conductivity line patterns due to different drying dynamics.

ELO-AlN layers were grown on stripe-patterned thin AlN seed-layer directly deposited on (111) Si substrates by using an 'NH3 pulsed-flow multi-layer (ML) growth' technique. A 4 mu m-thick ELO-AlN layer with stripe pattern along < 10-10 > direction of AlN can be coalesced successfully. We achieved marked reduction of crack and threading dislocation density (TDD) in the ELO AlN layers. In fact, the (10-12) full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray diffraction.-scan rocking curves (XRCs) of ELO-AlN template on Si substrate was reduced to be 980 arcsec. These results show that the combination of NH3 pulsed-flow ML growth and ELO method is effective to fabricate high-quality AlN templates on Si substrates. Moreover we fabricated 256-278 nm AlGaN quantum well (QW) DUV LEDs on the low TDD ELO-AlN templates on Si, and achieved single-peak operations under room temperature (RT) cw current injection.

J;"Yang, YL; Li, WY";;;;"Yang, Yuli; Li, Wenyao";;;Security-Oriented Polar Coding Based on Channel-Gain-Mapped Frozen Bits;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS;;;;;;;;;;;;In this paper, a novel design named security-oriented polar coding (SOPC) is proposed to enhance the physical layer security (PLS), where the active pattern of frozen bits in a transmission is determined by random channel gain of the legitimate link. Since the channel gain value is not exchanged between the legitimate transmitter and the desired receiver, eavesdroppers cannot ascertain the frozen bit pattern engaged in the legitimate polar coding. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, eavesdroppers are unable to appropriately decode the confidential information delivered over the legitimate link. As the SNR increases, eavesdroppers may have chance to sort out the correct frozen bit pattern through a brute-force search. However, this chance is significantly reduced by our SOPC. We design the SOPC for both single-input-single-output single-antenna eavesdropper (SISOSE) and multiple-input-multiple-output multi-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) channels. Its PLS functioning is assessed in terms of the error rate difference between the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper.

We study both the coherent and non-coherent transmission modes, formulating a weighted sum rate maximization problem for each; finding the optimal solution to these problems is known to be NP-hard. We use tools from fractional programming, block coordinate descent, and compressive sensing to construct an algorithm that optimizes the beamforming weights and user scheduling and converges in a smooth non-decreasing pattern. Channel state information (CSI) being crucial for optimization, we highlight the importance of employing a low-overhead pilot assignment policy for scheduling problems. In this regard, we use a variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering, which provides a suboptimal, but feasible, pilot assignment scheme; for our cell-free case, we formulate an area-based pilot reuse factor. Our results show that our scheme provides large gains in the long-term network sum spectral efficiency compared to benchmark schemes such as zero-forcing and conjugate beamforming (with round-robin scheduling) respectively.

Patterns in daily flight distances and utilization distributions (UD; estimates of area occupied on the ground) were documented throughout the annual cycle. Maximum Daily Displacement (MDD), the farthest distance occupied by a bird from colony/roost (central place) in 24 hr was greatest (4.3 +/- 0.1 km) during breeding season and lowest (3.3 +/- 0.1) during post-breeding season. As birds visited multiple foraging sites and made multiple round trips to central places, this Total Daily Distance (TDD) was also measured. It increased from a mean of about 12 km during the incubation phase to about 35 km at the time of fledging. Average TDD was greatest during breeding season (14.2 +/- 0.3 km) and lowest during winter (11.0 +/- 0.2 km). The utilization distribution increased from 128 (+/- 21.3) ha during breeding season to 179 (+/- 32.6) ha during winter.

First, there are 3 factors/models that have a major impact on the performance of UDNs, and they should be considered when performing theoretical analyses: i) a multi-piece path loss model with line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions; ii) a non-zero antenna height difference between base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs); iii) a finite BS/UE density. Second, there are 4 factors/models that have a minor impact on the performance of UDNs, i.e., changing the results quantitatively but not qualitatively, and thus their incorporation into theoretical analyses is less urgent: i) a general multi-path fading model based on Rician fading; ii) a correlated shadow fading model; iii) a BS density dependent transmission power; iv) a deterministic BS/user density. Finally, there are 5 factors/models for future study: i) a BS vertical antenna pattern; ii) multi-antenna and/or multi-BS joint transmissions; iii) a proportional fair BS scheduler; iv) a non-uniform distribution of BSs; v) a dynamic time division duplex (TDD) or full duplex (FD) network.

The BS chooses each slot the users to be active, and serves them using Zero Forcing (ZF) precoding. This requires the knowledge of the users' channels which is assumed to be performed e.g. via uplink training. Due to the channel acquisition overhead, only a subset of users must be active at each timeslot (depending on traffic patterns and channel states). In this paper, we develop an active user selection strategy where the base station sets a given threshold for the channel gain of the users. Then, only the users that have their channel gain higher than the threshold send their training sequence and are then considered to be served. The base station estimates the channel states of these users and, due to channel reciprocity, uses these channel states to transmit data via ZF precoding. With appropriate signaling and threshold selection, which adapt to the queuing behavior of the users, we prove that our proposed method achieves a larger stability region than the baseline centralized policy where the BS selects the users based on channel statistics and queue lengths. The performance of the threshold-based method is illustrated via simulations, where we can observe a tradeoff between the expansion of the stability region and delay performance.;;;;;"Destounis, Apostolos/Y-7252-2019; Debbah, Merouane/B-6261-2011";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1550-3607;;978-1-4673-6432-4;;;;2015;;;;;;;2869;2875;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000371708103014;

The MPSS samples' surfaces consisted of a triangular grid of about 375 nm high truncated cones with different pitches of 460 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, 700 nm and 800 nm. A commercially available patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) and a flat sapphire substrate (FSS) was also used in the experiments for comparison. According to the cathode luminescence observation, the GaN template on MPSS with a thickness of 3 mu m showed a threading dislocation density (TDD) of around 1.9 x 10(8) cm(-2). Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that many of the dislocations were bent and disappeared as loops formed in the vicinity of MPSS cones. On the other hand, PSS required a GaN template thicker than 5 mu m to achieve a level of TDD equal to MPSS. The LED on MPSS with a pitch of 600 nm showed the highest light output power among the evaluated LEDs as it was 1.89 times higher than that on FSS and 1.05 times higher than that on PSS. The pitch dependence of the light output improvement agrees with the pitch dependence of the simulated transmissivity at the GaN/sapphire interface. As a result of our comparison, we concluded that MPSS provides the most cost effective solution for high performance LEDs. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), with its direct projections to the hippocampus, has been proposed to be the key source of temporal information for hippocampal time cells. However, the behavioral relevance of such temporal firing patterns remains unclear, as most of the paradigms used for the study of temporal processing and time cells are either spatial tasks or tasks for which MEC function is not required. In this study, we asked whether the MEC is necessary for rats to perform a time duration discrimination task (TDD), in which rats were trained to discriminate between 10-s and 20-s delay intervals. After reaching a 90% performance criterion, the rats were assigned to receive an excitotoxic MEC-lesion or shamlesion surgery. We found that after recovering from surgery, rats with MEC lesions were impaired on the TDD task in comparison to rats with sham lesions, failing to return to criterion performance. Their impairment, however, was specific to the longer, 20-s delay trials. These results indicate that time processing is dependent on MEC neural computations only for delays that exceed 10 s, perhaps because long-term memory resources are needed to keep track of longer time intervals.;;;;;"; Sabariego, Marta/L-1786-2017";"Hunt, Thomas/0000-0001-6663-1719; White, Andre/0000-0001-7355-9989; Sabariego, Marta/0000-0003-2544-3708; Tenney, Sarah/0000-0003-1167-920X";;;;;;;;;;;;;1074-7427;1095-9564;;;;NOV;2021;185;;;;;;;;107507;10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107507;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107507;;SEP 2021;;;;;;34474155;;;;;WOS:000696787700005;

Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) has thus been greatly developed in the past ten years in order to be able to by-pass the skin protective layers in a minimally invasive way. With the advent of micro electro mechanical systems, opportunities have appeared, particularly in the area of microneedles. In this paper we present a new design of hollow polymeric microneedles aimed at being used for TDD by allowing injection of a liquid in the non-innerve part of the dermis. The design has been studied in order to be able to manufacture these microneedles arrays using techniques that may be applicable to industrial production at low cost. The envisioned microfabrication processes and their stacking are presented which involve injection micromolding and excimer laser ablation. Microneedles are also numerically characterized in terms of mechanics and microfluidics showing that the design also involves interesting features in terms of needles resistance and microfluidic. Due to the innovative double-molding technique, the micro-needles are indeed emptied leaving a cavity. An outlet channel on the side of the needle allows fluid flowing out of the needles. The characteristics of this outlet channel contribute to flow homogenization when several needles are placed in an array pattern. This microneedle design thus combines interesting characteristics in terms of ease of fabrication at large scale, mechanical resistance and fluid dynamics.;;;;;Delchambre, Alain/ABE-9019-2021;Delchambre, Alain/0000-0002-6047-1002;;;;;;;;;;;;;0946-7076;1432-1858;;;;OCT;2011;17;10-11;;;;;1675;1682;;10.1007/s00542-011-1355-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00542-011-1355-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000297161900014;

Two different buffer layer schemes between the film and the sapphire substrate were used, giving rise to differing threading dislocation densities (TDDs) in the GaN. Frequency-dependent capacitance and conductance measurements have been used to study the electronic states associated with the Mg doping, and to determine how these are affected by the TDD. Current-voltage and admittance spectroscopy measurements were carried out using Al/Au Schottky contacts and Ni/Au Ohmic contacts fabricated in a dot-and-ring pattern. Frequency-dependent measurements on these devices were corrected to remove the series resistance effects arising from the well known high resistivity of Mg-doped GaN using formulae derived from the equivalent parallel circuit model. Thermal admittance spectroscopy, in which the conductance is monitored as a function of temperature, verified the existence of a single impurity-related acceptor level in samples with different TDDs at 165 +/- 10 meV. For all of the samples the extrapolated capture cross-section values were very small, in the range of similar to 10(-20) cm(-2), suggesting that the acceptor level could be very repulsive. Since admittance spectroscopy detects only majority carrier traps, we believe these defect signature values are most probably associated with the Mg acceptor state as they are very close to the results previously reported by other research groups using different techniques.

The fabricated antenna is then subjected to bending, shear, stretching deformations and their effects on the bandwidth of the antenna are analysed using analysis of variance method. The significant factors and their percentage contribution on the bandwidth are also determined using the F-test.

In this context, co-channel interference may arise in high levels compromising the system's capacity and robust operation. Interference is further increased when limited directionality terminal antennas are employed to support non line-of-sight operation and in the case where an adaptive-time division duplex is selected for efficient radio resource management in asymmetric and time-varying traffic conditions. In this paper frequency channel assignment (CA) and antenna polarization assignment (PA) are considered as a means of mitigating interference. Two novel CA schemes that consider the distinct characteristics of F-BWA are proposed; the rotated-interleaved channel assignment and the non-uniform channel assignment. According to statistical interference simulation analysis the proposed schemes are more efficient in suppressing interference, achieving higher capacity compared to existing schemes while incurring no further complexity. In addition, instead of exploiting the performance of CA and PA schemes independently a framework for a joint CA-PA consideration is presented, where for a particular CA scheme an optimized PA pattern is developed. Results show that this approach improves the CA-PA interoperability increasing the overall performance. The efficiency of the proposed schemes is investigated for both FDD and adaptive-TDD schemes and is verified for various sectorization, frequency re-use and terminal antenna directivity configurations to ensure compatibility with different deployment scenarios.";;;;;;Sharif, Bayan/0000-0002-8679-4272;;;;;;;;;;;;;0929-6212;1572-834X;;;;MAR;2006;36;4;;;;;425;443;;10.1007/s11277-005-9004-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-005-9004-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000238011600008;

Here, low-cost AIN buffer layers were sputtered on cone-shaped patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs) to obtain high-quality GaN epilayers. Without any mask or regrowth, facet-controlled epitaxial lateral overgrowth was realized by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The uniform coating of the sputtered AIN buffer layer and the optimized multiple modulation guaranteed high growth selectivity and uniformity of the GaN epilayer. As a result, an extremely smooth surface was achieved with an average roughness of 0.17 nm over 3 X 3 mu m(2). It was found that the sputtered AIN buffer layer could significantly suppress dislocations on the cones. Moreover, the optimized three-dimensional growth process could effectively promote dislocation bending. Therefore, the threading dislocation density (TDD) of the GaN epilayer was reduced to 4.6 x 10(7) cm(-2), which is about an order of magnitude lower than the case of two-step GaN on the PSS. In addition, contamination and crack in the light-emitting diode fabricated on the obtained GaN were also effectively suppressed by using the sputtered AIN buffer layer. All of these advantages led to a high output power of 116 mW at 500 mA with an emission wavelength of 375 nm. This simple, yet effective growth technique is believed to have great application prospects in high-performance TDD-sensitive optoelectronic and electronic devices.;;;;;"liu, xiao/HKE-9880-2023; He, Chenguang/P-2498-2018";He, Chenguang/0000-0002-3683-9401;;;;;;;;;;;;;1944-8244;1944-8252;;;;DEC 13;2017;9;49;;;;;43386;43392;;10.1021/acsami.7b14801;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b14801;;;;;;;;29164860;;;;;WOS:000418204300106;

Our growth technique using SiN layers makes it possible to decrease twist components (edge-type threading dislocation components). The edge-type TDDs are almost the same values as those of LEDs grown on Al2O3 (0001) substrates. EQE of LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates increases with decreasing edge-type dislocation in the low-current-density region, and the EQE of the sample with low TDD is almost as high as that of the LED grown on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate at room temperature. It is found that the hot/cold factors (HCFs) of LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates increase with decreasing edge-type dislocations in the low-current-density region, but are less than those of an LED grown on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) shows that the dominant origin of the thermal quenching is edge-type dislocations in our samples, but other defects such as screw-type dislocations also contribute to it. We also found the fluctuated emission patterns consisting of bright and dark areas originated from the difference of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type defect densities in the multi-quantum wells (MQWs) grown on Si (111) substrates. The bright areas spread, and the configurations of the bright areas change into ring-like patterns with reducing edge-type TDDs. We suggest that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of dark areas should be promoted to improve the performance of the MQWs grown on Si (111) substrates.;;;;;;"Tajima, Jumpei/0000-0001-6157-7979; Kimura, Shigeya/0000-0002-2875-4563";;;;;;;;;;;;;0277-786X;;978-0-8194-9899-1;;;;2014;8986;;;;;;;;89861H;10.1117/12.2038714;http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2038714;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000336047500021;

Instead, channel reciprocity can be utilized in time division duplex (TDD) systems so that the downlink channel estimates can be based on pilots transmitted during the uplink. User mobility affects the reciprocity and makes the channel state information outdated for high velocities and/or long downlink subframe durations. Channel extrapolation, e.g. through Kalman prediction, can reduce the problem but is also limited by high velocities and long downlink subframes. An alternative solution has been proposed where channel predictions are made with the help of an extra antenna, e.g. on the roof of a car, so called predictor antenna, with the primary objective to measure the channel at a position that is later encountered by the rearward antenna(s). The predictor antenna is not directly limited by high velocities and allows the channel in the downlinks to be interpolated rather than extrapolated. One remaining challenge here is to obtain a good interpolation of the uplink channel estimate, since a sequence of uplink reference signals (pilots) will be interrupted by downlink subframes. We here evaluate a Kalman smoothing estimate of the downlink channels and compare it to a cubic spline interpolation. These results are also compared to results where uplink channels are estimated through Kalman filters and predictors. Results are based on measured channels and show that with Kalman smoothing, predictor antennas can enable accurate channel estimates for a longer downlink period at vehicular velocities. The gaps in the uplink pilot stream, due to downlink subframes, can have durations that correspond to a vehicle movement of up to 0.75 carrier wavelengths in space, for Rayleigh-like non-line-of-sight fading.;;;;;Björsell, Joachim/AAR-5334-2020;Björsell, Joachim/0000-0002-6254-3348;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-1-5386-6009-6;;;;2018;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000457761900206;

Appropriate gas-flow management realized by our homemade HVPE system permitted the growth of a GaN layer with a smooth as-grown surface and excellent thickness uniformity on the front surfaces of 4- or 6-inch patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs). However, when the grown thickness exceeded 20 mu m, single-side HVPE-growth induced fractures in GaN crystals. The fracture resistance of the GaN increased markedly when it was in a cleavage-resistant polycrystalline form (poly-GaN), permitting its growth to a thickness of 100 mu m. In the presence of a back-side poly-GaN layer, extremely thick GaN crystal layers could be grown on the front side without fractures. An 80-mu m-thick GaN template fabricated by two-side growth on a 4-inch PSS had a device-quality surface, negligible bowing, and low TDD (7 x 10(6) cm(2)). Issues of high fabrication costs, unavailability of large-size wafers, and large off-angle variations associated with native GaN wafers could be overcome by using our high-quality GaN templates as alternative substrates.

We have recently examined the effects of a moderate maternal exposure to EtOH on crucial brain enzyme activities in offspring rats, and discussed the translational challenges arising when attempting to simulate any of the clinical conditions associated with FASD. Materials and methods: In this current study, we: (i) address the need for a more consistent and reliable in vivo experimental platform that could simulate milder cases of FASD complicated by simultaneous thiamine-deprivation during gestation and (ii) explore the effects of such a moderate maternal exposure pattern to EtOH and a thiamine-deficient diet (TDD) on crucial enzyme activities in the offspring rat brains. Results: We demonstrate a significant decrease in the newborn and 21-day-old offspring body and brain weight due to maternal dietary thiamine-deprivation, as well as evidence of crucial brain enzyme activity alterations that in some cases are present in the offspring rat brains long after birth (and the end of the maternal exposure to both EtOH and TDD). Conclusions: Our findings provide a preliminary characterization of important neurochemical effects due to maternal exposure to EtOH and TDD during gestation that might affect the offspring rat neurodevelopment, and that characterization should be further explored in a brain region-specific manner level as well as through the parallel examination of changes in the offspring rat brain lipid composition.;;;;;"Zarros, Apostolos Ch/B-3131-2010; Kalafatakis, Konstantinos/AAO-1958-2020; Al-Humadi, Hussam/L-3619-2016; Al-Humadi, Hussam/M-6406-2019";"Kalafatakis, Konstantinos/0000-0002-7711-5194; Al-Humadi, Hussam/0000-0003-3691-0949; Al-Humadi, Hussam/0000-0003-3691-0949";;;;;;;;;;;;;1476-7058;1476-4954;;;;AUG 3;2021;34;15;;;;;2458;2466;;10.1080/14767058.2019.1667973;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2019.1667973;;SEP 2019;;;;;;31514558;;;;;WOS:000489419600001;

The suffix tree is a versatile data structure that can be used to evaluate a wide variety of queries on sequence datasets, including evaluating exact and approximate string matches, and finding repeat patterns. However, methods for constructing suffix trees are often very time-consuming, especially for suffix trees that are large and do not fit in the available main memory. Even when the suffix tree fits in memory, it turns out that the processor cache behavior of theoretically optimal suffix tree construction methods is poor, resulting in poor performance. Currently, there are a large number of algorithms for constructing suffix trees, but the practical tradeoffs in using these algorithms for different scenarios are not well characterized. In this paper, we explore suffix tree construction algorithms over a wide spectrum of data sources and sizes. First, we show that on modern processors, a cache-efficient algorithm with O(n(2)p) worst-case complexity outperforms popular linear time algorithms like Ukkonen and McCreight, even for in-memory construction. For larger datasets, the disk I/O requirement quickly becomes the bottleneck in each algorithm's performance. To address this problem, we describe two approaches. First, we present a buffer management strategy for the O(n(2)) algorithm. The resulting new algorithm, which we call Top Down Disk-based (TDD), scales to sizes much larger than have been previously described in literature. This approach far outperforms the best known disk-based construction methods. Second, we present a new disk-based suffix tree construction algorithm that is based on a sort-merge paradigm, and show that for constructing very large suffix trees with very little resources, this algorithm is more efficient than TDD.;;;;;;Tian, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-6835-8434;;;;;;;;;;;;;1066-8888;0949-877X;;;;SEP;2005;14;3;;;;;281;299;;10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000232164600002;

The procedures are composed of a global growth of Ge layer on Si followed by a planarization using CMP as initial process steps. The growth parameters of the Ge layer were carefully optimized and after cycle-annealing treatments, the threading dislocation density (TDD) was reduced to 3 x 10(7) cm(-2). As a result of this process, a tensile strain of 0.25% was induced, whereas the RMS value was as low as 0.81 nm. Later, these substrates were covered by an oxide layer and patterned to create trenches for selective epitaxy growth (SEG) of the Ge layer. In these structures, a type of compressive strain was formed in the SEG Ge top layer. The strain amount was -0.34%; meanwhile, the TDD and RMS surface roughness were 2 x 10(6) cm(-2) and 0.68 nm, respectively. HRXRD and TEM results also verified the existence of compressive strain in selectively grown Ge layer. In contrast to the tensile strained Ge layer (globally grown), enhanced PL intensity by a factor of more than 2 is partially due to the improved material quality. The significantly high PL intensity is attributed to the improved crystalline quality of the selectively grown Ge layer. The change in direct bandgap energy of PL was observed, owing to the compressive strain introduced. Hall measurement shows that a selectively grown Ge layer possesses room temperature hole mobility up to 375 cm(2)/Vs, which is approximately 3 times larger than that of the Ge (132 cm(2)/Vs). Our work offers fundamental guidance for the growth of high-quality and compressive strain Ge epilayer on Si for future Ge-based optoelectronics integration applications.";;;;;"wang, wenwu/HOF-4371-2023; Miao, Yuanhao/AIE-6862-2022";"Miao, Yuanhao/0000-0002-0301-3056; guilei, wang/0000-0002-1311-8863";;;;;;;;;;;;;;2079-4991;;;;JUN;2021;11;6;;;;;;;1421;10.3390/nano11061421;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano11061421;;;;;;;;34071167;;;;;WOS:000666045300001;

The case of the Berchules River in Sierra Nevada (Southern Spain);SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT;;;;;;;;;;;;Aquifers in permeable formations developed in high-mountain watersheds slow down the transfer of snowmelt to rivers, modifying rivers' flow pattern. To gain insight into the processes that control the hydrologic response of such systems the role played by groundwater in an alpine basin located at the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula is investigated. As data in these environments is generally scarce and its variability is high, simple lumped parameter hydrological models that consider the groundwater component and snow accumulation and melting are needed. Instead of using existing models that use many parameters, the Temez lumped hydrological model of common use in Spain and Ibero-American countries is selected and modified to consider snow to get a simplified tool to separate hydrograph components. The result is the TDD model (Temez-Degree Day) which is applied in a high mountain watershed with seasonal snow cover in Southern Spain to help in quantifying groundwater recharge and determining the groundwater contribution to the outflow. Average groundwater recharge is about 23% of the precipitation, and groundwater contribution to total outflow ranges between 70 and 97%. Direct surface runoff is 1% of precipitation. These values depend on the existence of snow. Results are consistent with those obtained with chloride atmospheric deposition mass balances by other authors. They highlight the important role of groundwater in high mountain areas, which is enhanced by seasonal snow cover. Results compare well with other areas. This effect is often neglected in water planning, but can be easily taken into account just by extending the water balance tool in use, or any other, following the procedure that has being developed.

In older patient populations, there has been effort placed in reducing exposure to potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). After years of reducing exposure of older adults in our hospitals to PIMs through multi-component interventions, our system chose to expand the scope and attempt a new strategy to lessen alert burden for providers and pharmacists. Based on the American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria and internal data, a passive CDS approach, termed geriatric context was established to recommend appropriate medication selection including lower dosage amounts and frequency of administration in older adults.Methods: Retrospective descriptive study examining change in a pre and post implementation analysis of medication usage patterns between two 9-month time periods in 2019 and 2021 in patients age =65 years across an 8-hospital health system. The primary endpoint is the percentage of each medication intervened with an ordered dose and frequency outside of alignment with recommended context parameters. Secondary endpoints include total daily dose (TDD) and average dose (AD) per patient of the individual PIMs. Exploratory endpoints include frequency of active alerts fired by the CPOE and overridden by providers.Results: A total of 62,738 older adult hospital admissions are included in the overall study period, with 32,969 pre-implementation and 29,769 post-implementation. Haloperidol showed the greatest reduction in inappropriate doses from 41.5% to 21.4% (p < 0.001) of orders, followed by reduction in inappropriate frequencies in orders for diphenhydramine from 57.2% to 39.7% (p < 0.001). Secondary endpoints showed favorable reductions across 11 of the 16 medications in both TDD and AD administered. Exploratory analysis with select medications showed reductions in frequency of alerts fired and overridden.Conclusions: Utilization of a passive CDS positively influences prescribing patterns for older adults and reduces the alert burden to ordering providers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0002-8614;1532-5415;;;;2023 SEP 14;2023;;;;;;;;;;10.1111/jgs.18586;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jgs.18586;;SEP 2023;;;;;;37706219;;;;;WOS:001066598000001;

We adopt a centralized scheduling scheme that selects a number of active pairs in each time-slot. We consider that the transmitters apply interference alignment (IA) technique if two or more pairs are active, whereas in the special case where one pair is active point-to-point MIMO singular value decomposition (SVD) is used. We consider a time-division duplex (TDD) system where transmitters acquire their channel state information (CSI) by decoding the pilot sequences sent by the receivers. Since global CSI knowledge is required for IA, the transmitters have also to exchange their estimated CSIs over a backhaul of limited capacity (i.e. imperfect case). Under this setting, we characterize in this paper the stability region of the system under both the imperfect and perfect (i.e. unlimited backhaul) cases, then we examine the gap between these two resulting regions. Further, under each case we provide a centralized probing policy that achieves the max stability region. These stability regions and scheduling policies are given for the symmetric system, where all the path loss coefficients are equal to each other, as well as for the general system. For the symmetric system, we provide the conditions under which IA yields a queueing stability gain compared to SVD. Under the general system, the adopted scheduling policy is of a high computational complexity for moderate numbers of pairs, consequently we propose an approximate policy that has a reduced complexity but that achieves only a fraction of the system stability region. A characterization of this fraction is provided.;;;;;Debbah, Merouane/B-6261-2011;assaad, mohamad/0000-0003-3909-6241;;;;;;;;;;;;;0018-9448;1557-9654;;;;JAN;2018;64;1;;;;;547;576;;10.1109/TIT.2017.2748518;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2748518;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000418754100033;

Re-Du-Ning inhalation solution (RIS) is an aerosol derivative from the Re-Du-Ning injection and has been clinically used to treat respiratory diseases like pneumonia for more than twenty years in China. However, the aerosolization and inhalation performances of RIS using different nebulizers have not been characterized, which may affect the therapeutic effects of RIS on respiratory diseases. We investigated the inhalation performances of RIS using five different nebulizers utilizing Spraytec, breath simulator of BRS 2000 and NGI techniques. We tested 5 different types of jet nebulizer, using RIS and an adult breathing pattern, to determine the difference in aerosol delivery over time. The particle size distribution of RIS was monitored by a Spraytec laser particle sizer. Fine particle fraction (FPF) and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) for RIS were measured using NGI. Aerosol deposited on the filter was analysed using HPLC. Nebulization time was much longer for the Pari Boy SX (red) nebulizer than for the other nebulizers, with the minimum delivery rate (DR) and the maximum total delivered dose (TDD) and total exhalation dose (TED). Nebulization time for Pari Boy SX (blue) was the lowest, with the highest DR and the lowest TDD and TED. Furthermore, the aerodynamic particle size of RIS was much larger for the Pari blue and Pari LC Plus than other nebulizers. Pari red produced the smallest aerodynamic particle size of RIS in these five nebulizers. In addition, a good linear relationship was found between MMAD and D-50 in these five nebulizers. The results demonstrated that Pari Boy SX (red) delivered most slowly and produced the smallest aerodynamic particle size of the RIS aerosols, which may be applied to manage lower respiratory diseases. Moreover, Pari LC Plus and Pari Boy SX (blue) emitted quickly and generated larger aerodynamic particle size of RIS aerosols, which could be used to treat upper respiratory diseases. A good linear relationship between MMAD and D-50 showed Spraytec could be a reliable technique for the development, evaluation and quality control of aerosol particles of inhalation solution preparations.;;;;;GAO, XIAO/JED-3257-2023;"Zhang, Yi/0000-0002-4168-1311; Luo, Gan/0000-0002-3644-5752";;;;;;;;;;;;;;2046-2069;;;;SEP 25;2019;9;52;;;;;30292;30301;;10.1039/c9ra06177k;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06177k;;;;;;;;35530199;;;;;WOS:000487989300027;
