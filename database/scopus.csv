Moreover, in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces(RIS)-Assisted wireless networks using millimeter wave (mmWave), it is crucial to optimize each RIS element's phase shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a channel estimation method in TDD-based wireless communication system using auto encoder in RIS-Assisted wireless networks. The trade-off relationship between channel estimation accuracy and the number of pilot signals is optimized when performing channel estimation. Through denoising autoencoder and Average Percentage of Zeros(APoZ), we find the optimal pilot pattern considering not only the number of pilots but also the location. As a result of the experiment, the proposed method has little difference in performance or outperforms the full neural network without pruning. © 2022 IEICE.","Channel Estimation; Deep Learning; mm Wave; Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces","Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Learning systems; Millimeter waves; Wireless networks; Accurate channel estimation; Auto encoders; Channel estimation method; Deep learning; Mm waves; Reconfigurable; Reconfigurable intelligent surface; Surface elements; Wave channels; Wireless communication system; Channel estimation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142086471"

In recent years, attention has been focused on identifying student subgroups with different patterns of online SRL behaviors and comparing their learning performance. However, there is limited research leveraging traces of SRL behaviors to detect student subgroups and examine the subgroup differences in cognitive load and student engagement. The current study tracked the engagement of 101 graduate students with SRL-enabling tools integrated into an asynchronous online course. According to the recorded SRL behaviors, this study identified two distinct student subgroups, using sequence analysis and cluster analysis: high SRL (H-SRL) and low SRL (L-SRL) groups. The H-SRL group showed lower extraneous cognitive load and higher learning performance, germane cognitive load, and cognitive engagement than the L-SRL group did. Additionally, this study articulated and compared temporal patterns of online SRL behaviors between the student subgroups combining lag sequential analysis and epistemic network analysis. The results revealed that both groups followed three phases of self-regulation but performed off-task behaviors. Additionally, the H-SRL group preferred activating mastery learning goals to improve ethical knowledge, whereas the L-SRL group preferred choosing performance-avoidance learning goals to pass the unit tests. The H-SRL group invested more in time management and notetaking, whereas the L-SRL group engaged more in surface learning approaches. This study offers researchers both theoretical and methodological insights. Additionally, our research findings help inform practitioners about how to design and deploy personalized SRL interventions in asynchronous online courses.

This changes the work pattern of the people who are required to carry out all online-based activities, including the implementation of seminars or conferences. The amount of training and socialization carried out by webinars requires a good webinar management system. The purpose of this paper is to develop a web-based information system for webinar activity management under the name webiplan. The method used in system development is the waterfall method. In the waterfall method, there are 5 stages, including requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. The subjects of this research are prospective end users of the system, namely lecturers and students who are accustomed to participating in webinars. The design and development stages are tailored to the user's needs obtained in the previous phase and are described as product backlog items. At the verification stage, three stages are used to evaluate the feasibility level of the information system, including: unit testing using whitebox testing, validation testing using the blackbox testing method, and compatibility testing. The results of whitebox testing and blackbox testing showed that every feature and user task could run well so as to provide convenience for the organizers and participants in the implementation of the webinar. This Webiplan is also compatible with various web browsers so as to give users flexibility in using it.  © 2022 IEEE.","Information System; Management; Online Seminar; Webinar Information System","Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Product design; Web browsers; Well testing; Activity managements; Industrial revolutions; Management systems; Online seminar; System development; Waterfall methods; Web based information systems; Webinar information system; White-box testing; Work patterns; Information management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137938674"

Instructors need to grade increasing amounts of student work. Unit testing can contribute to the automation of the grading process but it cannot assess the structure or partial correctness of code, which is needed for finely differentiated grading. This paper builds on previous research that investigated machine learning models for determining the correctness of programs from token-based features of source code and found that some such models can be successful in classifying source code with respect to whether it passes unit tests. This paper makes two further contributions. First, these results are scrutinized under conditions of varying similarity between code instances used for model training and testing, for a better understanding of how well the models generalize. It was found that the models do not generalize outside of groups of code instances performing very similar tasks (corresponding to similar coding assignments). Second, selected binary classification models are used as a base for multi-class prediction with two different methods. Both of these exhibit prediction success well above the random baseline, with potential to contribute to automated assessment with multi-valued measures of quality (grading schemes), in contrast to the binary pass/fail measure associated with unit testing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Applied Machine Learning for Code Assessment; Automated Grading; Student Programming Code Grading","Automation; Machine learning; Well testing; Applied machine learning; Applied machine learning for code assessment; Automated grading; Grading process; Machine-learning; On-line setting; Programming codes; Source codes; Student programming code grading; Unit testing; Grading","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164261529"

At industrial systems the scale and size of Facebook's, doing this is infeasible. We should not create mutants that the test suite would likely fail on or that give no actionable signal to developers. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we semi-automatically learn error-inducing patterns from a corpus of common Java coding errors and from changes that caused operational anomalies at Facebook specifically. We combine the mutations with instrumentation that measures which tests exactly visited the mutated piece of code. Results on more than 15,000 generated mutants show that more than half of the generated mutants survive Facebook's rigorous test suite of unit, integration, and system tests. Moreover, in a case study with 26 developers, all but two expressed that the mutation exposed a lack of testing in principle. As such, almost half of the 26 would actually act on the mutant presented to them by adapting an existing or creating a new test. The others did not for a variety of reasons often outside the scope of mutation testing. It remains a practical challenge how we can include such external information to increase the true actionability rate on mutants. © 2021 IEEE.","Getafix; Machine Learning; Mutation Monkey; Mutation Testing","Codes (symbols); Machine learning; Social networking (online); Testing; Case-studies; Facebook; Getafix; Industrial systems; Learn+; Machine-learning; Mutation monkey; Mutation testing; System test; Unit tests; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106138886"

Consequently, numerous tools, techniques, paradigms, and strategies that facilitate the quality assurance of the developed applications have emerged. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of those strategies. In contrast to the traditional approach, it places testing ahead of the actual implementation, which, in turn, also heavily influences the system’s design. With the approach being rather complex, naturally, guidance on its correct application is one of the most relevant aspects for many practitioners. To provide assistance to them, but also to researchers concerned with the domain, the publication at hand identifies twenty guidelines for the practical application of TDD in software engineering, by conducting a structured literature review. In doing so, it provides a solid foundation for the implementation of corresponding endeavors as well as a starting point for further discussion. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Best practice; Guidance; Guideline; Literature review; Pattern; Software engineering; Test-driven development","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136982061"

In CPS-based monitoring applications, abnormal (including anomalies/outliers) values can lead to severe consequences for skewed judgments. The criteria for determining abnormal values may change over time, making it impossible to detect abnormal in real-time based on a training model or rely on traditional statistical methods to find abnormal values efficiently. When machine learning using, abnormal values in the data set are considered data errors or noise and excluded from analysis for the stability of the results. However, the identified abnormal values contain essential information in some cases, making correct navigation and identifying anomalies even more critical. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Dynamic Data-Awareness (TDD-Awareness) algorithm that extracts the characteristics of continuous sensor data and accurately identifies abnormal values through the subsequent preprocessing process. The TDD-Awareness algorithm extracts the number of generated abnormally, the time of occurrence, and the characteristics and patterns needed to analyze the location of occurrence from the sensor data. The importance of “abnormal values” is determined by effectively exploring the relationship between abnormally to separate containing necessary information. © 2022","Contextual Anomaly; CPS; Data Awareness; Digital Twin; IoT; Outlier Detection; Point Anomaly; Preprocessing; Trustworthy","Anomaly detection; Data mining; Internet of things; Abnormal values; Awareness model; Contextual anomaly; Data awareness; Dynamic data; Outlier Detection; Point anomaly; Preprocessing; Sensors data; Trustworthy; Embedded systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129370944"

Smart devices send data to smart contracts or change their own status based on smart contracts. Businesses want to use smart devices and smart contracts to streamline workflow because smart contracts reduce the need in trusted intermediators and cut down enforcement costs. However, developing smart contract applications is challenging due to different memory models, different interaction models, and a dearth of supporting tools and libraries. When developers are asked to reimplement conventional applications to smart contracts, it is thus ideal to automatically transform them, avoiding manual labor, as well as ensuring reliability and security. This paper contributes a set of rules to transform conventional applications in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern into smart contracts running on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain platform preferred by businesses. Major transformations are performed in the model, while in the controller, model calls are replaced by smart contract calls. The source application and the target smart contract are all written in Java. Our rules add read-your-writes consistency that Hyperledger Fabric does not natively support. Runtime pre- and post-condition checking in the original application is supported in the transformed smart contract. We evaluated our rules on CoCoME and other MVC applications, and all code ran correctly and passed unit tests.  © 2022 IEEE.","Code generation; Hyperledger fabric; IoT; Smart contract; Transformation","Blockchain; Codes (symbols); Distributed ledger; Internet of things; Block-chain; Codegeneration; Condition; Enforcement costs; Hyperledg fabric; IoT; Model-view controller; Smart devices; Transformation; Work-flows; Smart contract","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153860822"

Many unit test generation tools that can help generate unit test cases with high structural coverage over a program have been examined. However, the fact that existing test generation tools are mainly evaluated on general software programs calls into question about its practical effectiveness and usefulness for machine learning libraries, which are statistically orientated and have fundamentally different nature and construction from general software projects. In this paper, we set out to investigate the effectiveness of existing unit test generation techniques on machine learning libraries. To investigate this issue, we conducted an empirical study on five widely used machine learning libraries with two popular unit testcase generation tools, i.e., EVOSUITE and Randoop. We find that (1) most of the machine learning libraries do not maintain a high-quality unit test suite regarding commonly applied quality metrics such as code coverage (on average is 34.1%) and mutation score (on average is 21.3%), (2) unit test case generation tools, i.e., EVOSUITE and Randoop, lead to clear improvements in code coverage and mutation score, however, the improvement is limited, and (3) there exist common patterns in the uncovered code across the five machine learning libraries that can be used to improve unit test case generation tasks.  © 2021 IEEE.","Empirical software engineering; Test case generation; Testing machine learning libraries","Machine learning; Software testing; Code coverage; Empirical Software Engineering; Generation tools; Mutation score; Software project; Test case; Test case generation; Testing machine learning library; Unit test generations; Unit tests; Libraries","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115676453"

Due to the split of baseband functions between Distributed (DU) and Centralized Units (CU) the F1 interface has been defined, creating a new domain for transport access networks - midhaul. In this paper, we estimate the statistical multiplexing gain (MG) of traffic aggregation from different DUs on midhaul link. Results of the evaluation can be deployed in Cloud RAN dimensioning system used in the network planning process. Midhaul transport links must provide sufficient capacity and Quality of Service (QoS) to enable required radio performance. To understand the QoS requirement (temporal values of throughputs) of the radio interface and traffic profile patterns, the system level simulator has been used during the study. To enable scaling of simulation results (from 21 to 200 or more cells network) or use other traffic measurements, we have defined a method that is based on a bootstrap methodology. Results show that an optimal point between D U and CU to place an aggregation point is where it could aggregate traffic from 20-40 cells. This method enables reduction of the computational time from several days to several seconds, which is significant for network dimensioning recommendation and in turn for efficiency and elasticity of the service delivered to the telecommunication operators.  © 2022 University of Split, FESB.","5G wireless networks; bootstrap; Cloud RAN; dimensioning; multiplexing gain; QoS","5G mobile communication systems; Quality of service; Radio links; Wireless networks; 5g wireless network; Bootstrap; Centralised; Cloud radio access network; Dimensioning; Multiplexing gains; Network dimensioning; Quality-of-service; Radio access networks; Traffic measurements; Radio access networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141550659"

Even more so, at a very low latency. 5G, mainly StandAlone (SA) but also Non-SA (NSA) architectures, both Non-Public-Network (NPN) and commercial public network, was hailed as the solution enabling TV and media newsgathering, sports coverage and similar live events with a simple single off-the-shelf 5G modem. Results of this paper, which are based on real testbeds, shed light on potential weaknesses in the effort of delivering a reliable professional live UL video transmission in field production utilizing a single 5G modem. On the other hand, the tested bonding technique that uses multiple 5G modems for UL video transmission, enhances the 5G Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) rather than exhausting each of them. Bonding technique is a key enabler for live news and live sports productions, resulting not only in increased UL rate, but also in stability and reliability as shown in this work. Several additional insights are touched upon in this work, about the benefit in Time Division Duplexing (TDD) UL pattern, 5G SA UL when bonded with its 4G network and more.  © 2022 IEEE.","5G; bonding; latency; media streaming; testbed; uplink transmission","5G mobile communication systems; Image communication systems; Multimedia systems; Queueing networks; Testbeds; Video streaming; 5g; Bonding; Bonding techniques; Large parts; Latency; Live video; Live video streaming; Public networks; Uplink transmission; Video transmissions; Benchmarking","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142276036"

However, there are two major issues: (i) determining the TDD scheme (i.e., the number of slots devoted to UL and DL) to meet the dynamic traffic demands of the Users Equipment (UE); (ii) cross-link interference between cells that use different TDD schemes. The 3GPP standard neither specifies algorithms or solutions to derive the TDD configuration nor solves the cross-link interference. To fill this gap, we model the dynamic TDD problem in 5&#x00A0;G NR as a linear programming problem. Then, we design Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning based 5&#x00A0;G RAN TDD Pattern (MADRP), a fully decentralized solution based on the Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) approach. Based on the simulation results, the algorithm effectively prevents buffer overflows, avoids cross-link interference, and adapts to changes in the traffic pattern, ensuring its versatility. We compared our solution with the optimal solution and different static TDD configurations.. We found that MADRP outperforms the static TDD configurations. We finally discuss the algorithm&#x0027;s limitations in terms of the number of cells, traffic variance, and cross-link interference probability.

Objective: Leveraging this pattern, we implemented a prototype tool, Test Suite Evolver (TSE), to support the generation of test cases for structurally similar methods. Our prototype tool is applicable to both, incomplete test suites with the purpose of test case augmentation, as well as evolving test suites when a newer version of a software becomes available. Method: Making use of the aforementioned code-test co-evolution pattern, TSE leverages source code structural similarity and a set of existing test cases to synthesise and recommend new unit tests. For this, TSE initially identifies groups of structurally similar methods in the code, determines changes at the token-level, and integrates the retrieved information to synthesise updated test cases. Results: Our evaluations indicated that 38% of the source code of five large open-source applications consist of methods which are structurally similar to each other and therefore for which, the co-evolution pattern holds. Applying TSE to these methods, TSE generated 72% of the minimum required test cases with only 11% token-based edit distance between the generated test cases and those written by developers. To evaluate the test cases' validity, we used code2vec, a neural network to measure the structural and semantic similarity between the generated and developed test cases. The results indicated that TSE successfully generated test cases with a similarity measure of more than 80% in more than 95.6% of test cases and similarity measure of 100% for 88.35% of the test cases. Conclusion: The evaluations revealed that TSE is able to generate the majority of the necessary test cases with an insignificant amount of modifications required from the developers.

Inclusion of the approximation unit can provide 3X compression (i.e. from 66 to 22 samples) to the spike waveforms while preserving their shapes. Detailed spike waveform sequences based on in-vivo measurements have been generated using a customized neural simulator for performance assessment of the approximation unit tested on six published feature extractors. For noise levels σN between 0.05 and 0.3 and groups of 3 spikes in each channel, all the feature extractors provide almost same sorting performance before and after approximation. The overall implementation cost when including the approximation unit and feature extraction shows a large reduction (i.e. up to 8.7X) in the hardware costly and more accurate feature extractors, offering a substantial improvement in feature extraction design. © 2022 IEEE.","","Action Potentials; Algorithms; Computers; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Records; Cost reduction; Electrophysiology; Extraction; % reductions; Action-potentials; Feature extractor; Features extraction; High-order; Higher-order; Processing chain; Shape preservation; Spike waveforms; Spike-sorting; action potential; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; computer; information processing; physiology; Feature extraction","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138127406"

Twins implements three types of Byzantine behaviors: (i) leader equivocation, (ii) double voting, and (iii) losing internal state such as forgetting “locks” guarding voted values. To emulate interesting attacks by a Byzantine node, it instantiates twin copies of the node instead of one, giving both twins the same identities and network credentials. To the rest of the system, the twins appear indistinguishable from a single node behaving in a “questionable” manner. Twins can systematically generate Byzantine attack scenarios at scale, execute them in a controlled manner, and examine their behavior. Twins scenarios iterate over protocol rounds and vary the communication patterns among nodes. Twins runs in a production setting within DiemBFT where it can execute 44M Twins-generated scenarios daily. Whereas the system at hand did not manifest errors, subtle safety bugs that were deliberately injected for the purpose of validating the implementation of Twins itself were exposed within minutes. Twins can prevent developers from regressing correctness when updating the codebase, introducing new features, or performing routine maintenance tasks. Twins only requires a thin wrapper over DiemBFT, we thus envision other systems using it. Building on this idea, one new attack and several known attacks against other BFT protocols were materialized as Twins scenarios. In all cases, the target protocols break within fewer than a dozen protocol rounds, hence it is realistic for the Twins approach to expose the problems. © Shehar Bano, Alberto Sonnino, Andrey Chursin, Dmitri Perelman, Zekun Li, Avery Ching, and Dahlia Malkhi.","Byzantine Fault Tolerance; Distributed Systems; Real-World Deployment","Fault tolerant computer systems; Program debugging; Attacks scenarios; Automated units; Byzantine attacks; Byzantine fault tolerance; Communication pattern; Distributed systems; Internal state; Real world deployment; Routine maintenance; Unit tests; Fault tolerance","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127416398"

Currently, lateral resolutions down to only 30 μm have been demonstrated for roll-to-roll (R2R)-compatible PEDOT:PSS printing. However, increasing lateral resolution of the printing technique can increase the complexity/ability of printed devices. Topographical discontinuous dewetting (TDD) and liquid-bridge transfer (LBT) is employed as a high-resolution, scalable, R2R-compatible patterning technique to fabricate PEDOT:PSS patterns with down to 400 nm lateral resolution and high thicknesses. PEDOT:PSS ink dispersions were prepared with water/ethanol/cosolvent mixtures to enable the TDD process and ensure high conductivity. After transfer by LBT to target substrates, an impressive average conductivity of 20.5 S cm-1 was measured for the transferred PEDOT:PSS patterns without any post-transfer conductivity-enhancing treatments. Post-transfer conductivity-enhancing treatments were applied that are device fabrication-compatible (acid-free) with very high conductivities up to ∼2590 S cm-1 and average conductivity of ∼1190 S cm-1 for PEDOT:PSS lines patterns fabricated with 4.3% dimethylformamide (DMF) cosolvent. Interestingly, DMF cosolvent in the PEDOT:PSS ink dispersion formed higher conductivity line patterns due to different drying dynamics. This work demonstrates a path to achieve high-resolution, scalable, R2R-compatible printing of PEDOT:PSS patterns while maintaining very high conductivities for future advanced printable electronic devices.

Our approach enables to interpret the advanced antenna systems (AAS) coverage and massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) spatial resolution, by the inspection of the array resultant multiple beams. Particularly, the impact on the mMIMO spatial resolution is conducted as a function of the channel correlation, by means of an exclusively radiofrequency (RF) approach, with the advantage of not considering the system-level features, and using a new figure of merit ( \Lambda factor). The new figure of merit enables to evaluate the antenna array diversity from two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) beamforming, by computing the number of lobes with gain higher than a unique element. In the 3D case, the figure of merit is based on a differential calculation, which enables performing an infinitesimal counting of lobes per antenna element beamwidth. Such parameter is initially applied to a theoretical dipole-based array, with the purpose of quantifying the created multiple beams by the overlapped radiation patterns from mMIMO systems.

Unit tests can be affected by Test Smells (TS), which are defined as poorly designed tests due to bad programming practices implemented in unit test code. Problems caused by TS negatively impact the efficiency of developers and the understanding and maintenance of unit tests. Reducing the problems caused by TS can occur through refactoring activities. Despite the existence of studies that seek to identify the occurrence of TS in unit tests and proposals for semi-automatic refactoring, there are no studies related to the automatic removal of TS from the test repository. In this context, this study presents a method for automatic TS removal called Eager Test, which occurs when a test verifies more than one method of the code. The proposed method was evaluated through experiments, comparing the original version of a unit tests repository with its automatically refactored version. The results are promising, showing an Eager Test removal rate of 99,4% of unit tests in the repository without causing test errors or test fails. However, there was an increase in test execution time and of lines of code, resulting from the quantity of tests that were extracted. The proposed method supports improving the quality of unit tests and reduces the effort required by developers to remove Eager Test.  © 2022 ACM.","Eager Test; Identification; Refactoring; Test smell","Codes (symbols); Odors; Automatic refactoring; Development process; Eager test; Identification; IS artifacts; Refactoring methods; Refactorings; Software errors; Test smell; Unit tests; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147437601"

Its goal is to help readers learn software design by discovering the experience of the design process. To this end, the text follows a continuous narrative that introduces each element of design know-how in context, and explores alternative solutions in that context. This narrative is complemented by hundreds of code fragments and design diagrams. The first chapter is a general introduction to software design and the subsequent chapters cover design concepts and techniques. The concepts and techniques covered include interfaces, encapsulation, inheritance, design patterns, composition, functional-style design, unit testing, and many more. A major emphasis is placed on coding and experimentation as a necessary complement to reading the text. To support this aspect of the learning process, a companion website with practice exercises is provided, as well as two complete sample applications. Guidance on these sample applications is provided in “Code Exploration” insets throughout the book. Although the Java language is used as a means of conveying design-related ideas, the book’s main goal is to address concepts and techniques that are applicable in a host of technologies. This second edition covers additional design techniques such as input validation and dependency injection. It also provides extended and revised treatment of many core subjects, including polymorphic copying, unit testing, the Observer pattern, and functional-style programming. This book is intended for readers who have a minimum of programming experience and want to move from writing small programs and scripts to tackling the development of larger systems. This audience naturally includes students in university-level computer science and software engineering programs. As the prerequisites to specific computing concepts are kept to a minimum, the content is also accessible to programmers with no previous background in computing. In a similar vein, understanding the code fragments requires only a minimal grasp of the Java language, such as would be taught in an introductory programming course. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019, 2022.","Design Patterns; Java; Software Architecture; Software Development; Software Engineering; Software Testing","","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165028804"

Through factor analysis on the behavior data of 13 measurement indicators of learners, this paper uses multiple linear regression model to analyze the correlation between learners’ online learning behavior and their final exam scores. The research found that the final examination results of learners are obviously positively correlated with the basic question factors and comprehensive question factors.

An array of submicron SOI strips is prepared as a patterned substrate, on which Ge is epitaxially grown by chemical vapor deposition. A continuous Ge film is formed by a coalescence of the adjacent Ge crystals on the arrayed SOI strip, while leaving semicylindrical voids on the exposed surface of the buried SiO2 (BOX) layer between the strips. The TDD of the coalesced Ge film is reduced to 1.0 ± 0.1 × 108 cm-2, which is approximately a half of 2.2 ± 0.2 × 108 cm-2 for a Ge film on an unpatterned SOI. A transmission electron microscope observation reveals that the TDD reduction is derived from a downward bending of the dislocation toward the void.

However, it is still a challenging mission to develop a model with high predictability that captures the horizontal-vertical features of ionospheric electrodynamics. In this study, multiple observations during 2005–2019 from space-borne global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) systems (COSMIC and FY-3C) and the Digisonde Global Ionosphere Radio Observatory are utilized to develop a completely global ionospheric three-dimensional electron density model based on an artificial neural network, namely ANN-TDD. The correlation coefficients of the predicted profiles all exceed 0.96 for the training, validation and test datasets, and the minimum root-mean-square error of the predicted residuals is 7.8 × 104 el/cm3. Under quiet space weather, the predicted accuracy of the ANN-TDD is 30%–60% higher than the IRI-2016 at the Millstone Hill and Jicamarca incoherent scatter radars. However, the ANN-TDD is less capable of predicting ionospheric dynamic evolution under severe geomagnetic storms compared to the IRI-2016 with the STORM option activated. Additionally, the ANN-TDD successfully reproduces the large-scale horizontal-vertical ionospheric electrodynamic features, including seasonal variation and hemispheric asymmetries. These features agree well with the structure revealed by the RO profiles derived from the FORMOSAT/COSMIC-2 mission. Furthermore, the ANN-TDD successfully captures the prominent regional ionospheric patterns, including the equatorial ionization anomaly, Weddell Sea anomaly and mid-latitude summer nighttime anomaly. The new model is expected to play an important role in the application of GNSS navigation and in the explanation of the physical mechanisms involved. © 2021.

However, they are limited by the fact that the simulation setup must exactly match the original experimental setup, including the network topology, the mobility patterns and the number of network nodes. In this paper, we propose the Machine Learning based Propagation Loss (MLPL) module for ns-3. Based on network traces collected in an experimental testbed, the MLPL module estimates the propagation loss as the sum of a deterministic path loss and a stochastic fast-fading loss. The MLPL module is validated with unit tests. Moreover, we test the MLPL module with real network traces, and compare the results obtained with existing propagation loss models in ns-3 and real experimental results. The results obtained show that the MLPL module can accurately predict the propagation loss observed in a real environment and reproduce the experimental conditions of a given testbed, enabling the creation of digital twins of wireless network environments in ns-3.  © 2022 ACM.","Machine learning; Propagation loss model; Trace-based simulation","Backpropagation; Cell proliferation; Deep learning; E-learning; Stochastic systems; Testbeds; Current traces; Experimental testbed; Machine-learning; Performance; Propagation loss; Propagation loss models; Realistic conditions; Simulation approach; Trace-based simulation; Wireless networking; Wireless networks","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133330513"

D-TDD dynamically changes the TDD configuration of a cell without interrupting users' connectivity, hence balancing the bandwidth for UL or DL communication according to the traffic pattern. However, 3GPP standard does not specify algorithms or solutions to derive the TDD configuration, i.e., the number of slots to dedicate to UL and DL. In [1], we have proposed a Machine Learning (ML)-based solution relaying on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to allow the base station (or gNB) to self-adapt to the traffic pattern of the cell by periodically adapting the number of slots dedicated to UL and DL. In this work, we implemented the DRL algorithm on top of an open-source gNB based on OpenAirInterface (OAI) [3] to demonstrate its efficiency. To this end, we relied on the O-RAN architecture [5], where the proposed DRL algorithm is deployed as xApp at the Near Real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and communicates with the base station using O-RAN E2 interface. We developed xTDD Service Model (SM) following the E2SM standard [5], allowing the DRL solution to monitor DL and UL buffers from the gNB to deduce the optimal TDD configuration that accommodates the current traffic. Then, the decision (i.e., TDD configuration) is pushed to the base station. We implemented the solution on top of the OAI 5G StandAlone (SA) platform and Open Networking Foundation (ONF) RIC [4] based on μonos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a ML-based D-TDD on top of a real 5G network, showing the advantage of O-RAN architecture to building Self Organized Network (SON) function for dynamic configuration of D-TDD.  © 2022 ACM.","5G; dynamic TDD; O-RAN; OpenAirInterface; reinforcement learning","5G mobile communication systems; Balancing; Base stations; Deep learning; Memory architecture; Network architecture; 5g; Dynamic TDD; Dynamic time; Machine-learning; O-RAN; Openairinterface; RAN architecture; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Reinforcement learnings; Traffic pattern; Reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139714964"

Security is a multidisciplinary aspect of the software development lifecycle, operation, and user utilization. Being a complex and specialized area of software engineering, it is often sidestepped in software development methodologies and processes. We address software security at the design level by adopting design patterns that encapsulate reusable solutions for recurring security problems. Design patterns can help development teams implement the best-proven solutions for a specialized problem domain. However, from the analysis of three secure pattern implementations by 70 junior programmers, we detected several structural errors resulting from their interpretation. We propose reusable unit testing test cases based on annotations to avoid secure pattern interpretation errors and provide an example for one popular secure pattern. Providing these test cases to the same group of programmers, they implemented the pattern without errors. The reason is annotations build a framework that disciplines programmers to incorporate secure patterns in their applications and ensure automatic testing.  © 2013 IEEE.","Security; software design; software safety; software testing","Computer architecture; Computer software reusability; Computer software selection and evaluation; Errors; Safety testing; Security of data; Software design; Software reliability; Code; Interpretation errors; Production facility; Security; Software safety; Software security; Software testings; Software-Reliability; Software testing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161046532"

(Comput. Phys. Commun. 184 (2013) 1812–1813) we presented Hyper-Fractal Analysis, a visual tool for estimating the fuzzy fractal dimension of images and 4D objects. As Visual Basic 6 could be considered an outdated language, with limited Object-Oriented Programming capabilities, migrating the application to C#.Net was treated in high priority. Following the goal of creating a highly reusable fractal analysis library, the code was also refactored to SOLID. Together with various improvements, the.Net version is also providing new tools for iso-fractal areas identification. The project success was confirmed by a comparative old/new version study. On the other hand, the most relevant functionalities were covered by unit tests.

Solution method: Optimized version of the fuzzy box-counting algorithm. Reasons for the new version: Migration from VB6 to C#.Net, adding new tools for iso-fractal areas identification. Summary of revisions: • The main goal of this work was creating a highly reusable fractal analysis library. Following this purpose Hyper-Fractal Analysis v04 [1] was migrated from VB6 (an outdated language, with limited OOP capabilities) to C#.Net [2]. This opportunity was also used for refactoring the code to SOLID [3]. • The box-counting algorithm [4] implemented in the previous version is limited to 4D objects. In current version the number of dimensions is limited only by the available resources. • The previous fuzzy [5,6] box-counting implementation is accepting only 0-255 shades of gray windows. The new version allows defining parametrizable fuzzy band-pass filters. • An important attention was also paid on developing new tools for identification of iso-fractal areas (the sets of points characterized by the same local fractal dimension [7]).

However, wide variation exists in insulin practice and usage across the Indian geography. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a retrospective audit of the medical records of T2DM patients who were receiving insulin and attending an urban referral clinic in Northeast India during the period from 2006 to 2017 was conducted to analyze the insulin utilization pattern and injection technique variation. A total of 1,454 patients were included, 60% were male and 40% were female. Results: At presentation, the mean duration of T2DM was 12.13 (7.45) years. Insulin with or without oral anti-diabetic (OADs) was received by 52.27% and 47.73% of patients, respectively. The majority (62.93%) used a pen device for insulin administration. The patient-reported reasons for insulin therapy initiation were OAD failure (33.15%), glucotoxicity (30.26%) and diabetes-associated complications (20.36%). The mean ± standard deviation (SD) total daily dose (TDD) of insulin was 33.05 ± 17.09 (0.53 ± 0.30 units/kg/day). The breakup for the number of injection(s) per day was one (234,16.09%), two (970,66.71%), three (166,11.42%), four (78, 5.36%), and five (6, 0.41%). The majority (67.88%) used premixed insulin, while 10.90% used basal insulin alone. Compared to those without lipohypertrophy (LH), patients with LH were less likely to rotate the site of injection (0.85 vs 17.90%; p = 0.000), space the injections (10.71 vs 23.91%; p = 0.000), injected less often in correct site (7.81 vs 29.0%; p = 0.000), more likely to use wrong angles (10.08 vs 22.73%; p = 0.000) and reuse the needles (5.63 vs 14.86%; p = 0.000). Also, 34.87% of patients were not storing their insulin device at the right temperature and 8.87% experienced at least one episode of a hypoglycemic event. Conclusion: This audit depicts important attributes of current injection practices amongst T2DM patients on insulin and suggests the possible benefits of adopting correct practices for avoiding complications such as LH and hypoglycemia. ©The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170696908"

We report on an extensive study to understand such composite refactoring procedures for the purpose of improving testability. We collected and studied 346,841 java pull requests from 621 GitHub projects. First, we compared the atomic refactorings in two populations: pull requests with changed test-pairs (i.e. with co-changes in production and test code and thus potentially including testability refactoring) and pull requests without test-pairs. We found significantly more atomic refactorings in test-pairs pull requests, such as Change Variable Type Operation or Change Parameter Type. Second, we manually analyzed the code changes of 200 pull requests, where developers explicitly mention the terms 'testability' or 'refactor + test'. We identified ten composite refactoring procedures for the purpose of testability, which we call testability refactoring patterns. Third, we manually analyzed additional 524 test-pairs pull requests: both randomly selected and where we assumed to find testability refactorings, e.g. in pull requests about dependency or concurrency issues. About 25% of all analyzed pull requests actually included testability refactoring patterns. The most frequent were extract a method for override or for invocation, widen access to a method for invocation, and extract a class for invocation. We also report on frequent atomic refactorings which co-occur with the patterns and discuss the implications of our findings for research, practice, and education. © 2023 IEEE.","mining software repositories; Pull request mining; refactoring patterns; software quality; software testability","Computer software selection and evaluation; Software testing; Mining software; Mining software repository; Pull request mining; Refactoring pattern; Refactorings; Software Quality; Software repositories; Software testability; Testability; Unit tests; Atoms","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171765718"

This paper presents an experiment based on A/B testing methodology to gather developer preferences at test cases presentation. This survey involved 44 developers from 17 country.

Such test cases have been successfully and extensively adopted to test different software levels, from unit tests (e.g., JUnit) to end-to-end Web Graphical User Interface (GUI) tests (e.g., Selenium Webdriver). While test execution is mostly automated by existing tools, test design remains a manual task. In the pursuit of a more automated test case generation approach, the use of models has been advocated by the model-based testing (MBT) technique. Current MBT approaches assume a top-down workflow in which testers design models, test cases are generated from models, and then scripts are written to automate test execution. Nevertheless, writing automated tests is nowadays a developer’s responsibility and testers face a scenario in which automated tests might be reused to produce new model-based tests. This paper aimed to improve the synergy between existing automated tests and MBT. To do so, we present an approach that infers a model from existing tests, a tester leverages this model to include new tests, and then test code is generated. We analyzed the proposed approach in the context of Web applications with system-level GUI tests that employ the Page Object pattern. For MBT, we adopted event-driven models augmented with parameters and test input data. We evaluated the approach’s applicability with a prototype tool called MoLeWe and an experimental study with nine open-source Web applications. The results provide some evidence that using MoLeWe may help to include new tests faster than manually coding them, while increasing the overall code coverage of the test suite. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Automated tests; GUI tests; Model-based testing; Page objects; Test case generation","Automation; Graphical user interfaces; Open source software; Software testing; Testing; Agile methods; Automated test; Graphical user interfaces test; Model based testing; Page object; Test case; Test case generation; Test execution; WEB application; Web applications; Model checking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120068446"

This approach integrated Swift programming language, iOS development, UML, software testing, MVC, Cocoa Touch Framework and Design Patterns into a comprehensive experiment, through which students can master the engineering methods to solve complex application problems.In college, traditional computer programming courses focus on the grammar and classical algorithm of programming language. Usually the amount of code is far lower than that of industrial products. Such programming courses can't effectively improve students' ability to solve complex engineering problems. They also can't meet the requirements of industrial development. Students are not satisfied with the results of these courses. There is an intense need for the studies of enhancing student's computer engineering ability.Taking Swift Language Programming course as an example, this paper presented a comprehensive experiment approach to enhancing students' computer engineering ability by developing classic industrial iOS Apps.Flipped classroom pedagogy is conducive to free much time in class. Lecturers can fully communicate with students and help students complete challenging tasks. The comprehensive experiment consists of pre-class activities and in-class activities. Before class, the lecturer provides experiment materials online including theoretical handouts of Design Patterns, manuals of UML 2.0 specifications and Cocoa Touch reference manual, etc. Students learn the materials by themselves, practice and discuss online and complete the corresponding pre-class tests. In class, the lecturer analyzes in detail the problems students encounter after class and guides them to solve these problems. The lecturer also participates in each group discussion to ensure the smooth progress of students' project.The implementation of comprehensive experiment is divided into four sub tasks. These tasks are app function analysis, App detailed design, programming implementation, and App release and launch. First, according to the requirements of the App, the function is analyzed in detail and defined with UML. Second, based on functional analysis, the App's system architecture, data structure, view combination, logic execution process and core algorithms are designed. The system is defined in detail with UML Class diagram. Third, according to the detailed design of the App, user interface is built by Xcode storyboard, and the model layer, view layer and control layer are implemented in Swift. Then unit test and system test are conducted on the App and bugs are repaired. Finally, App launch is completed including App internationalization, developer certificate applying, creating description file, setting product identification and deployment information, and submitting App online.To assess the effect of this comprehensive experiment approach, three-year teaching data were analyzed using statistical methods. The results show that students' engineering ability (measured by code scale) and student satisfaction (measured by questionnaires) were significantly improved.Our contribution is to propose a detailed comprehensive experiment approach to enhancing computer engineering ability. The analysis of teaching data show that it is helpful to improve students' computer engineering ability and course satisfaction. © 2022 IEEE.","active learning; comprehensive experiment; engineering ability; flipped classroom; iOS App","Codes (symbols); Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Problem oriented languages; Program debugging; Software testing; Students; User interfaces; Active Learning; Comprehensive experiment; Computer engineering; Design Patterns; Detailed design; Engineering abilities; Flipped classroom; IOS app; Programming course; Software testings; Application programs","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143779677"

The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), with its direct projections to the hippocampus, has been proposed to be the key source of temporal information for hippocampal time cells. However, the behavioral relevance of such temporal firing patterns remains unclear, as most of the paradigms used for the study of temporal processing and time cells are either spatial tasks or tasks for which MEC function is not required. In this study, we asked whether the MEC is necessary for rats to perform a time duration discrimination task (TDD), in which rats were trained to discriminate between 10-s and 20-s delay intervals. After reaching a 90% performance criterion, the rats were assigned to receive an excitotoxic MEC-lesion or sham-lesion surgery. We found that after recovering from surgery, rats with MEC lesions were impaired on the TDD task in comparison to rats with sham lesions, failing to return to criterion performance. Their impairment, however, was specific to the longer, 20-s delay trials. These results indicate that time processing is dependent on MEC neural computations only for delays that exceed 10 s, perhaps because long-term memory resources are needed to keep track of longer time intervals. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Elapsed time; Elapsed time memory; Long-term memory; MEC; Time duration; Working memory","Animals; Conditioning, Operant; Discrimination Learning; Entorhinal Cortex; Male; Memory Disorders; Memory, Episodic; Rats; Rats, Long-Evans; Time Perception; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; brain cortex lesion; brain region; connectome; discriminative stimulus; hippocampal CA2 region; hippocampus; linear regression analysis; long term memory; medial entorhinal cortex; medial entorhinal cortex lesion; memory consolidation; nerve cell; nerve projection; nonhuman; postoperative period; rat; task performance; time duration discrimination task; animal; discrimination learning; entorhinal cortex; episodic memory; injury; Long Evans rat; male; memory disorder; operant conditioning; pathophysiology; physiology; time perception","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114186362"

As in every new technology, performance assessment and evaluation of the impact of interference is of interest for industry and academia. In this paper, we present contributions on those topics. First, we evaluate the performance of mIAB compared to fiber-connected deployments. Moreover, we study the impact of interference on the performance of mIAB networks and propose a solution based on inserting silent slots on the time division duplex (TDD) frame pattern. According to our simulation results, mIAB is capable of improving performance of onboard user equipments (UEs) without harming too much the quality of service (QoS) of surrounding UEs. Furthermore, we show that the TDD frame pattern should be carefully designed to account for scenarios with different levels of interference. © 2022 IEEE.","5G standardization; 6G; IAB; mobile IAB; mobility; moving cell; relay; wireless backhaul","5G mobile communication systems; Quality of service; Time division multiplexing; 5g standardization; 6g; Integrated access; Integrated access and backhaul; Mobile integrated access and backhaul; Mobility; Moving cell; Relay; Wireless backhaul; Standardization","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146943812"

The least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimators are investigated with three categories of pilots, namely regular pilots (RPs), time-superimposed (or superimposed ) pilots and staggered pilots (StP). Two patterns of frequency reuse (FR) per category are used. The simulation results showed that by increasing the number of BS antennas with a fixed number of symbols dedicated to the UL phase and vice versa, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the LS and MMSE estimators using the superimposed pilot (SuP) or StP is asymptotically approaches the NMSE of the LS and MMSE estimators using the RP, respectively.

This book, updated for the recently released C++20 standard, is a must for every developer, software architect, or team leader who is interested in well-crafted C++ code, and thus also wants to save development costs. If you want to teach yourself about writing better C++ code, Clean C++20 is exactly what you need. It is written for C++ developers of all skill levels and shows by example how to write understandable, flexible, maintainable, and efficient C++ code. Even if you are a seasoned C++ developer, there are nuggets and data points in this book that you will find useful in your work. If you don't take care with your codebase, you can produce a large, messy, and unmaintainable beast in any programming language. However, C++ projects in particular are prone to get messy and tend to slip into a maintenance nightmare. There is lots of C++ code out there that looks as if it was written in the 1980s, completely ignoring principles and practices of well-written and modern C++. It seems that C++ developers have been forgotten by those who preach Software Craftsmanship and Clean Code principles. The web is full of C++ code examples that may be very fast and highly optimized, but whose developers have completely ignored elementary principles of good design and well-written code.

Then, the effect of MOVPE growth conditions on the crystallinity was elucidated. The faceted structure clearly changed with the growth temperature (Tg), following the same trend as the epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN film on micro-patterned GaN. High Tg levels enhanced the lateral growth, and thus with a high Tg of 1300 °C, the coalescence in the early growth stage resulted in AlN films with coalesced surfaces and a thickness of 1 µm. For the AlN film grown at a Tg of 1300 °C, the threading dislocation density (TDD) was estimated to be 6.0 × 108 cm−2. This value proved that coalesced AlN films on nano-patterned FFA Sp-AlN templates with low TDDs could be achieved with the appropriate MOVPE growth conditions.

Data regarding treatment, management, and outcomes of cardiac manifestations of TDD are lacking. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe TDD-related cardiac crises. Methods: Retrospective multicenter chart review was made of TDD patients admitted with cardiac crises, defined as development of ventricular tachycardia (VT), cardiomyopathy, or cardiac arrest during metabolic crises. Results: Twenty-seven children were admitted for 43 cardiac crises (median age 6.4 years; interquartile range [IQR] 2.4–9.8 years) at 14 centers. During crisis, QTc prolongation occurred in all (median 547 ms; IQR 504–600 ms) and a type I Brugada pattern in 8 (26%). Arrhythmias included VT in 21 (78%), supraventricular tachycardia in 3 (11%), and heart block in 1 (4%). Nineteen patients (70%) developed cardiomyopathy, and 20 (74%) experienced a cardiac arrest. There were 10 deaths (37%), 6 related to arrhythmias. In 5 patients, recalcitrant VT occurred despite use of antiarrhythmic drugs. In 6 patients, arrhythmias were controlled after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support; 5 of these patients survived. Among 10 patients who survived VT without ECMO, successful treatment included intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, and atrial pacing in multiple cases and verapamil in 1 patient. Initiation of feeds seemed to decrease VT events. Conclusion: TDD-related cardiac crises are associated with a high risk of arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and death. Although further studies are needed, early recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Acutely, intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, atrial pacing, and ECMO as a last resort seem to be the best current treatment options, and early initiation of feeds may prevent VT events. © 2022","Arrhythmia; Brugada syndrome; Cardiac arrest; Cardiomyopathy; Crisis; Death; Long QT syndrome; TANGO2; Treatment; Ventricular tachycardia","Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Cardiomyopathies; Child; Heart Arrest; Humans; Isoproterenol; Magnesium; Tachycardia, Ventricular; Verapamil; antiarrhythmic agent; isoprenaline; magnesium; verapamil; cardiomyopathy; child; clinical trial; complication; heart arrest; heart arrhythmia; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; multicenter study","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132898816"

For the present study, seven sites were selected with the aims of assessing plant diversity, structure and regeneration potential in tropical forests across Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS), Western Ghats, India. The sites were classified based on the similarity: tropical dry deciduous sites (TDDs I and II), tropical semi-evergreen sites (TSEs I and II) and tropical evergreen sites (TEFs I-III). The phytosociological survey was done by laying a total of 70 plots (10 plots in each study site). Standard methods were followed for the assessment of diversity, structure and regeneration patterns. A total of 267 species (205 genera, 70 families) were recorded. The tree species richness ranged 24 (TDD II) - 76 (TEF III). Of the vegetation spectrum, trees, vines and understorey accounted 56.5, 15.3 and 28.2% respectively to the total flora documented. A total of 66 species were endemic. The total tree density and tree basal area (seedlings, saplings, juveniles and adults) were 18,790 individuals (mean 2684) and 137.6 m2 (mean 19.7 m2) in 70 plots respectively. The mean tree adult density and basal area ranged 370 (TDD I) - 900 (TEF I) individuals/ha and 24.2 (TDD I) - 75.3 (TEF III) m2/ha respectively. The overall species richness was highest in TDD I, but TEF III had the highest tree species richness. The diameter class-wise distribution showed the characteristic 'reverse J-shaped' curve. Most tree species were 'newly recruited'. The dominant species had 'fair' to 'good' regeneration potential. However, 12 tree species showed 'no' regeneration. The overall regeneration pattern of trees was 'good', but 'no' or 'poor' regeneration patterns in some tree species, especially endemics is a point of concern. Since a majority of tree species were 'new recruits', species composition may likely change in the future. The results obtained would help in understanding diversity patterns, structural attributes and regeneration potential in tropical forests of protected areas for better forest management and conservation. © 2020 Ecological Society of China.

The burning of fossil fuels to meet the industrial electricity demand is leading to deleterious environmental effects. Economic load dispatch (ELD) is an optimization problem that determines an optimum way in terms of cost-effectiveness and emission minimization, for generating power by utilizing the electricity generation resources. Global climatic concerns are driving the researchers to spread the scope of ELD and include unconventional and renewable sources. This research work proposes a combination of three major renewable energy sources with thermal power sources (solar, wind and hydro). The proposed objective function includes a large number of major constraints related to each of the included sources which have not been combined before. The pattern search algorithm has been implemented on IEEE 40 unit test system combining wind, solar and hydro power generating units to observe the results. The results are also compared with the 140 unit Korean power generation model and in addition to several similar systems.

However, writing effective unit tests from scratch is difficult and tedious. One way to reduce this difficulty is to recommend existing tests of semantically similar functions. However, modifying the recommended tests manually might still be difficult and tedious. For example, developers have to understand various code elements in the recommended tests to accurately replace them with semantically similar code elements from the target application. One way to mitigate the issue is by developing a test migration or reuse technique that could automatically transform the code elements in the recommended tests and migrate them to the target application. However, to develop such a technique, we first need to identify what types of code transformations are required to successfully migrate the recommended tests. Therefore, in this paper, we first recruit two external participants to create JTestMigBench, a benchmark of 510 manually migrated JUnit tests for 186 methods from five popular libraries. We then analyze the code changes in the migrated tests to create JTestMigTax, a taxonomy of test code transformation patterns. Our contributions provide the necessary foundations to develop automated unit test migration or reuse techniques. © 2023 IEEE.","benchmark; code transformation; reuse; taxonomy; transplantation; unit test migration","Codes (symbols); Computer software selection and evaluation; Cosine transforms; Software testing; Benchmark; Code changes; Code transformation; Reuse; Software Quality; Target application; Test code; Transplantation; Unit test migration; Unit tests; Taxonomies","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160561787"

To fulfill this requirement, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) proposed dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) technology in Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release 11. Afterward, the 3GPP RAN#86 meeting clarified that 5G NR needs to support dynamic adjustment of the duplex pattern (transmission direction) in the time domain. Although 5G NR provides a more flexible duplex pattern, how to configure an effective duplex pattern according to services traffic is still an open research area. In this research, we propose a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based decentralized D-TDD configuration method. First, we model a D-TDD configuration problem as a dynamic programming problem. Given the buffer length of all UE, we model the D-TDD configuration policy as a conditional probability distribution. Our goal is to find a D-TDD configuration policy that maximizes the expected discount return of all UE’s sum rates. Second, in order to reduce signaling overhead, we design a fully decentralized solution with distributed MARL technology. Each agent in MARL makes decisions only based on local observations. We regard each base station (BS) as an agent, and each agent configures uplink and downlink time slot ratio according to length of intra-BS user (UE) queue buffer. Third, in order to solve the problem of overall system revenue caused by the lack of global information in MARL, we apply leniency control and binary LSTM (BLSTM) based auto-encoder. Leniency controller effectively controls Q-value estimation process in MARL according to Q-value and current network conditions, and auto-encoder makes up for the defect that leniency control cannot handle complex environments and high-dimensional data. Through the parallel distributed training, the global D-TDD policy is obtained. This method deploys the MARL algorithm on the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server of each BS and uses the storage and computing capabilities of the server for distributed training. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed MARL converges stably in various environments, and performs better than distributed deep reinforcement algorithm. © 2022 by the authors.

However, related work has shown that generated tests with high code coverage could be ineffective, i.e., they may not detect all faults or kill all injected mutants. In this paper, we propose Cling, an integration-level test case generation approach that exploits how a pair of classes, the caller and the callee, interact with each other through method calls. In particular, Cling generates integration-level test cases that maximize the Coupled Branches Criterion (CBC). Coupled branches are pairs of branches containing a branch of the caller and a branch of the callee such that an integration test that exercises the former also exercises the latter. CBC is a novel integration-level coverage criterion, measuring the degree to which a test suite exercises the interactions between a caller and its callee classes. We implemented Cling and evaluated the approach on 140 pairs of classes from five different open-source Java projects. Our results show that (1) Cling generates test suites with high CBC coverage, thanks to the definition of the test suite generation as a many-objectives problem where each couple of branches is an independent objective; (2) such generated suites trigger different class interactions and can kill on average 7.7% (with a maximum of 50%) of mutants that are not detected by tests generated randomly or at the unit level; (3) Cling can detect integration faults coming from wrong assumptions about the usage of the callee class (25 for our subject systems) that remain undetected when using automatically generated random and unit-level test suites.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.","class integration testing; CLING; coverage criteria; search-based software testing; test adequacy","Fault detection; Integration testing; Open source software; Testing; Classes integration testing; CLING; Code; Coverage criteria; Integration levels; Search problem; Search-based software testing; Software testings; Test adequacies; Test pattern generator; Integration","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140755953"

Hence, automatically generated tests are often affected by test-specific bad programming practices, i.e., test smells, that may hinder the quality of the test's source code and, ultimately, the quality of the code under test. Although EvoSuite uses secondary criteria and a post-processing procedure to optimize non-coverage aspects and improve the readability of the tests, it does not explicitly consider the usage of good programming practices. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to assist EvoSuite's search algorithm in generating smell-free tests out of the box. To this aim, we first compile a set of 54 test smell metrics from several sources. Secondly, we systematically identify 30 smells that do not affect the tests generated by EvoSuite and eight smells that cannot be automatically computed. Thirdly, we incorporate the remaining 16 test smells as metrics into EvoSuite and empirically identify that only 14 smells affect the tests generated by the tool (e.g., Indirect Testing). Fourthly, we describe and integrate an approach to optimize test smell metrics into EvoSuite. Finally, we conduct an empirical study to (i) understand to what extend EvoSuite's default mechanisms leads to the generation of fewer smelly tests. (ii) to assess whether our approach leads to the generation of fewer smelly tests. And (iii) how our approach affects the coverage and fault detection effectiveness of the generated tests.

Individual responses to CSII are diverse. The aim was to identify unique three-variate patterns of HbA1c, BMI standard deviation score (SDS), and TDD after switching to CSII. Methods: Five thousand one hundred and thirty-three youths (≤20 years; 48% boys; median age at pump start 12.5 years) with T1D duration ≥3 years at CSII initiation were selected from the multicenter DPV registry. We applied group-based multitrajectory modeling to identify groups of individuals following similar trajectories. Measurements were aggregated quarterly during a 3-year follow-up period. Trajectory variables were changes of HbA1c, BMI-SDS, and TDD from baseline (delta = quarterly aggregated values at each time point [i] minus the respective baseline value). Results: Four groups of diverging Delta-HbA1c, Delta-BMI-SDS, and Delta-TDD patterns were identified. All showed improvements in HbA1c during the first 3 months. Group 1 (12%) was characterized by modest HbA1c increase thereafter, TDD reduction, and stable BMI-SDS. In Group 2 (39%), increasing HbA1c, decreasing BMI-SDS, and stable TDD were found. By contrast, sustainably improved HbA1c, increasing BMI-SDS, and stable TDD were observed in Group 3 (32%). Group 4 (17%) was characterized by increasing levels for HbA1c, BMI-SDS, and TDD. Between-group differences in baseline HbA1c, BMI-SDS, TDD as well as in sex ratio, age at diabetes onset and at pump start were observed. Conclusions: Definite trajectories of glycemic control, BMI, and TDD over 3 years after CSII initiation were identified in youths with T1D allowing a more personalized treatment recommendation. © 2022 The Authors.

The procedures are composed of a global growth of Ge layer on Si followed by a planarization using CMP as initial process steps. The growth parameters of the Ge layer were carefully optimized and after cycle-annealing treatments, the threading dislocation density (TDD) was reduced to 3 × 107 cm−2 . As a result of this process, a tensile strain of 0.25% was induced, whereas the RMS value was as low as 0.81 nm. Later, these substrates were covered by an oxide layer and patterned to create trenches for selective epitaxy growth (SEG) of the Ge layer. In these structures, a type of compressive strain was formed in the SEG Ge top layer. The strain amount was −0.34%; meanwhile, the TDD and RMS surface roughness were 2 × 106 cm−2 and 0.68 nm, respectively. HRXRD and TEM results also verified the existence of compressive strain in selectively grown Ge layer. In contrast to the tensile strained Ge layer (globally grown), enhanced PL intensity by a factor of more than 2 is partially due to the improved material quality. The significantly high PL intensity is attributed to the improved crystalline quality of the selectively grown Ge layer. The change in direct bandgap energy of PL was observed, owing to the compressive strain introduced. Hall measurement shows that a selectively grown Ge layer possesses room temperature hole mobility up to 375 cm2/Vs, which is approximately 3 times larger than that of the Ge (132 cm2/Vs). Our work offers fundamental guidance for the growth of high-quality and compressive strain Ge epilayer on Si for future Ge-based optoelectronics integration applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Following this pattern in test cases may benefit comprehension, debugging, and maintenance. The AAA structure of real-life test cases, however, may not be clear due to their high complexity. Manually labeling AAA statements in test cases is tedious. Thus, we envision that an automated approach for labeling AAA statements in existing test cases could benefit new developers and projects that practice collective code ownership and test-driven development. This paper contributes an automatic approach based on machine learning models. The 'secret sauce' of this approach is a set of three learning features that are based on the semantic, syntax, and context information in test cases, derived from the manual tagging process. Thus, our approach mimics how developers may manually tag the AAA pattern of a test case. We assess the precision, recall, and F-1 score of our approach based on 449 test cases, containing about 16,612 statements, across 4 Apache open source projects. To achieve the best performance in our approach, we explore the usage of six machine learning models; the contribution of the SMOTE data balancing technique; the comparison of the three learning features; and the comparison of five different methods for calculating the semantic feature. The results show our approach is able to identify Arrangement, Action, and Assertion statements with a precision upwards of 92%, and recall up to 74%. We also summarize some experience based on our experiments - regarding the choice of machine learning models, data balancing algorithm, and feature engineering methods - which could potentially provide some reference to related future research.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.","AAA pattern; feature engineering; machine learning; natural language processing; software testing; unit testing","Artificial intelligence; Engineering education; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Open source software; Program debugging; Software testing; AAA pattern; Code; Computer bugs; Debugging; Feature engineerings; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Software testings; Tagging; Unit testing; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149408498"

We aimed to (1) test the usability and acceptability of A1Control, a simulation platform supporting insulin pump education, and (2) determine predictors of performance. Method: Rural adult insulin pump users with type 1 diabetes (T1D) participated in a mixed methods usability study in 2 separate rounds. Participants navigated 3 simulations (ie, infusion site occlusion, hypoglycemia, exercise). Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Systems Usability Scale (SUS) were administered. Semi-structured interviews and direct observation were used to assess perceived usability, acceptability and performance. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique was used to fit predictive models for visualization of patterns leading to good or poor A1Control performance. Results: Participants (N = 13) were 28-70 years old, 10 used automated insulin delivery and 12 used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Mean NPS was 9.5 (range 9-10) and positive sentiment during interviews indicated very high acceptability. SUS (mean 88.5, range 70-100) indicted a high perceived usability. CGM percent wear ≥ 94%, time spent in hypoglycemia ≤ 54 mg/dl of <0.01%, and <70 mg/dl of 0.5% predicted successful site-occlusion scenario performance with 100% accuracy. BOLUS score ≥ 2, TDD ≥ 34, and technology brand predicted exercise scenario success with 100% accuracy. There were an insufficient number of failed hypoglycemia scenarios to assess predictors.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis performed on the GaN seed layers shows a perfectly smooth, MOCVD-like morphology with a threading dislocation density (TDD) around 2 × 109 cm−2. We succeeded to regrow up to 10 μm and 5 μm crack-free GaN + HEMT and Al0.30G0.70N + HEMT structures, respectively and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed limited lateral growth on mesas with few microscopic defects while AFM show the same surface morphology of HEMT structures as ones grown on planar substrates.

No breakdown was noticed up to 200 V for the regrown Al0.30Ga0.70N (3 μm) HEMT and the GaN seed layer structures and the leakage current remained in the range of 1 nA. However, the leakage current in the regrown GaN (5 μm) structure reached rapidly 1 mA. Such a high leakage was not noticed for non-patterned devices. Thus, it is possibly attributed to silicon contamination in the regrown GaN layer. On the other hand, the absence of noticeable leakage in the regrown 3 μm thick Al-rich AlGaN buffer HEMT opens the way to a new competitive solution for high power electronics applications on silicon substrate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","AlGaN/GaN HEMTs; Patterning; Power electronics","Binary alloys; Gallium nitride; High electron mobility transistors; III-V semiconductors; Metallorganic chemical vapor deposition; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Semiconductor alloys; Silicon; Substrates; Surface morphology; AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors; Atomic-force-microscopy; High electron-mobility transistors; Layer structures; Metal-organic chemical vapour depositions; Patterning; Power-electronics; Seed layer; Si substrates; Transistor structure; Aluminum gallium nitride","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85157976593"

However, this process is rather costly and time consuming. Thus, much effort has been devoted to generating unit tests automatically. The common objective of test generation algorithms is to maximize code coverage. However, maximizing coverage is not necessarily correlated with identifying faults [1]. In this work, we propose a novel approach for test generation aiming at generating a small set of tests that cover the software components that are likely to contain bugs. To identify which components are more likely to contain bugs, we train a software fault prediction model using machine learning techniques. We implemented this approach in practice in a tool called QUADRANT, and demonstrate its effectiveness on five real-world, open-source projects. Results show the benefit of using QUADRANT, where test generation guided by our fault prediction model can detect more than double the number of bugs compared to a coverage-oriented approach, thereby saving test generation and execution efforts.  © 2021 IEEE.","Automated testing generation; Fault prediction; Machine learning; Software testing","Automatic test pattern generation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Forecasting; Learning systems; Open source software; Predictive analytics; Program debugging; Software quality; Verification; Fault prediction models; Generating unit; Machine learning techniques; Open source projects; Software component; Software fault prediction; Test generation algorithm; Test generations; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108023808"

Furthermore, such feedback is often based only on expected outputs for a given input, or on the teacher’s perception of errors that students may make, rather than on the errors they actually make. We present an early implementation of a tool prototype and supporting methodology to address these problems. After mining the source code of earlier students’ responses to exercises for frequent structural patterns, and classifying the found patterns according to these students’ scores, our tool automatically generates unit tests that correspond to bad practices, errors or code smells observed in students’ submissions. These unit tests can then be used or adapted by a teacher to integrate them into an autograder, in order to provide feedback of higher quality to future generations of students. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","autograders; automated feedback; code generation; CS education; pattern mining; unit testing","Errors; Autograder; Automated feedback; Codegeneration; CS education; Pattern mining; Programming exercise; Student numbers; Teachers'; Unit testing; Unit tests; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172938293"

An in-depth review of other research and literature is conducted to understand the benefits, impact, and features that similar programs are providing. Further, a qualitative survey has been given out to understand the potential users of the application and the feasibility of the proposed system which includes the user's concern, preferences, and expectations, whereas the respondents are 10 students and 10 people who are employed. Once the data has been gathered and analyzed, the features of the application are build based on the collected data where the application is trying to meet the user requirement. Afterward, there are four testing phases consist of unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing which are conducted to assure the system features and functions achieve what the users expect. Further, a UAT is conducted to ensure the users are joyed with the result which meets their requirements and expectation. Thus, the objectives of this study were all successfully fulfilled.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Behavioral research; Digital storage; Integration testing; Software prototyping; Surveys; Driving pattern; Highly-correlated; Mobile applications; Potential users; Qualitative surveys; System features; User acceptance testing; User requirements; Acceptance tests","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109083648"

This study aimed to assess real-life ISF among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogs and to detect factors associated with ISF among those patients. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted at Sohag University Hospital, Egypt, and included 93 participants aged 6–18 years, diagnosed with T1DM for at least 1 year and using insulin glargine 300 Units/mL or insulin degludec 100 Units/mL as basal insulin. The ISF, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) and insulin doses were initially assessed then adjusted as required. The participants were regularly contacted throughout the follow-up period. Glycemic control parameters were assessed after 3 months. Results: The ISF showed diurnal variation with higher correction dose requirements for the morning than for the rest of the day (p < 0.001). This pattern of diurnal variation was found in participants with different pubertal stages and in participants using either type of ultra-long acting basal insulin analogs. There was no significant difference between the ISF calculated according to the 1800 rule [1800/Total daily insulin dose (TDD)] and the morning ISF (p = 0.25). The 1800 rule-calculated ISF was significantly lower than the actual ISF for the afternoon (p < 0.001) and the evening (p < 0.001). ISF at different times of the day were significantly correlated with age, body mass index, pubertal stage, diabetes duration, TDD, and ICR. Multiple regression analysis revealed that ICR was the most significant factor associated with ISF. Linear regression analysis revealed that the ISF (in mg/dL) for any time of the day could be estimated as 5.14 × ICR for the same time of the day (coefficient = 5.14, 95% confidence interval: 5.10–5.19, R2 = 0.95, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Diurnal variation of ISF that had to be considered for proper calculation of correction doses. This diurnal variation was found in children and adolescents with different pubertal stages. The 1800 rule was appropriate for the morning correction doses but not in the afternoon or the evening. The TDD and the ICR could be used for ISF estimation.

In this paper, we briefly review the behavioral patterns that we have previously developed for the logical description of the programmable logic controllers (PLC) operations using tabular properties. We also present a diagram for the checking algorithm of a bounded model to investigate the feasibility of such properties. We describe how to implement the terms and formulas that provide the behavior patterns of PLC programs in an object-oriented programming language (C++ in this case). After the black box assessment for the values of the control variables for inputs and outputs of the system has been set, we show how convenient it is to describe the requirements in the form of our instantiated classes.

One relevant avenue of research is the transformation of software designs in order to increase efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Design Patterns are of interest here as the indirection they introduce is likely to have a detrimental effect on energy consumption. In this paper we report on our investigations into the impact on energy consumption of the Decorator pattern, which is a structural design pattern used to enable additional behaviour to be attached to an individual component dynamically. Application of this pattern improves the maintainability of software at the cost of increased indirection and redundancy, which may reduce energy efficiency. In this paper we explore features of the Decorator pattern that impact on its systematic removal, with a future goal of removing this pattern using automated refactoring. We subsequently examine experimentally the Decorator pattern's impact on energy consumption in Java and find its implementation results in an increased number of instantiated objects and method invocations at run-time. The removal of the pattern can result in up to a 96% reduction in energy consumption in a best-case scenario with a textbook example, and up to a 5% reduction in energy consumption in an open-source project with a case study examining JUnit, a popular unit testing framework for Java. These results demonstrate the energy savings achievable with the removal of Decorator pattern instances and open the way for similar investigations of other design patterns.  © 2022 IEEE.","Decorator Pattern; Design Patterns; Energy Efficiency; Green Technology; Object-Oriented Programming; Refactoring; Software Design; Software Transformation","Application programs; Climate change; Computer aided software engineering; Energy utilization; Java programming language; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Software design; Structural design; Decorator pattern; Design Patterns; Energy cost; Energy-consumption; Green technology; Objectoriented programming (OOP); Reduce energy consumption; Reduction in energy consumption; Refactorings; Software transformation; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135781876"

Energy has become a global concern amongst all software industries. Existing SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) model cannot meet the energy related issues associated with the devices, particularly smartphones that have limited battery life. In this paper, we have proposed a modified SDLC model that contains total seven steps which includes requirement analysis, design, coding, EE (Energy Efficiency) analysis, unit testing, integration testing and deployment. Among them, our main contribution is on EE analysis which checks a code based on three parameters named Memory Usage, Execution Cycle (CPU Usage) and Energy Usage. The process starts from the coding phase which is the third phase of our proposed model. A loop starts in coding phase and continues up to unit testing phase including the EE analysis. This loop checks a code either it is efficient or not based on some criteria. Efficient data access pattern, data representation, data organization, data precision choice, I/O configuration, dead code elimination, code transformation & increase of concurrency can produce different impact in software execution. We have achieved significant change in energy usage and memory usage by applying the above mentioned techniques. Calculated energy usage and memory usage of a software developed by traditional agile method is 0.1259mW & 39.40%, respectively whereas our proposed model achieved 0.0119mW & 27.33%, respectively. Our proposed SDLC model mainly focus on coding phase and it can reduce energy consumption rate of a software.  © 2022 IEEE.","EE Analysis; Energy Efficient Software; Execution Cycle; Memory Usage; SDLC Model","Application programs; Codes (symbols); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Metadata; Software design; Coding phasis; Energy efficiency analysis; Energy efficient; Energy efficient software; Energy usage; Execution cycles; Life cycle model; Memory usage; Software development life cycle model; Software development life-cycle; Integration testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159104013"

It is also important to know the precise timing of downlink and uplink for the 5G RF repeater that receives the signal of the base station with the link antenna, amplifies it, and serves through a service antenna because the 5G RF repeater also switches the roles of link antenna and service antenna when switching downlink and uplink. The synchronization signal block (SSB) decoding method is used to know the downlink and uplink timings of the base station. However, this method has the disadvantage that it cannot be used when the SS signal to interference and noise ratio (SS-SINR) is below the decodable SINR such as the boundary of multiple cells. This paper proposes a new method of synchronization signal abstraction that can acquire synchronization even in the section where SS-SINR is below the decodable SINR due to SS-SINR interference by introducing a way to acquire synchronization without decoding by receiving SSB and identifying its pattern. The new method of synchronization signal abstraction can increase the installation coverage of the 5G RF repeater by 293% compared to the SSB decoding method. © 2022 IEEE.","5G New Radio; 5G RF Repeater; SSB decoding; TDD Synchronization","5G mobile communication systems; Abstracting; Base stations; Decoding; Signal to noise ratio; Synchronization; Time division multiplexing; 5g new radio; 5g RF repeater; Decoding methods; Novel methods; Signal blocks; Signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratios; Synchronization signal block decoding; Synchronization signals; Time division duplex; Time division duplex synchronization; Antennas","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147545700"

A Ge film as thick as 1 µm is grown on the patterned Si by chemical vapor deposition with an ordinary two-step growth method, where a buffer layer of pure Ge as thin as 50 nm is grown at a low temperature of 370°C, followed by growth at an elevated temperature of 700°C.

To do so, the current reference trajectory tracking and modulation problems are addressed in a coordinated manner in the form of a constrained optimization problem that utilizes the knowledge of the stator current evolution&#x2014;as described by its gradient&#x2014;within the prediction horizon.

Understanding the challenges students face during testing can help inform practices for software testing education. To that end, we conduct an exploratory study to reveal students' perceptions of unit testing and challenges students encounter when practicing unit testing. We surveyed 54 students from two universities and gave them two testing tasks, one involving black-box test design and one involving white-box test implementation. For the tasks, we used two software projects from prior work in studying test-first development among software developers. We quantitatively analyzed the survey responses and test code properties, and qualitatively identified the mistakes and smells in the test code. We further report on our experience running this study with students. Our results regarding student perceptions show that students believe code coverage is the most important outcome for test suites. For testing practices, most students were ineffective in finding known defects. This may be due to the task design and/or challenges with understanding the source code. For testing pitfalls, we identified six test smells from student-written test code; the most common were ignoring setups in the test code and testing happy path only. These results suggest the students needed more introduction to these common testing concepts and practices in advance of the study activity. Through this experience, we have identified testing concepts that require emphasis for more effective future studies on testing behavior among students.  © 2021 ACM.","test smell; testing education; unit testing","Black-box testing; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Odors; Surveys; Testing; Code coverage; Exploratory studies; Professional software; Software developer; Software project; Source codes; Student perceptions; Test-first development; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109026668"

The method relies on the coalescence of GaN crystallites grown on top of a network of deformable pillars etched into a silicon-on-insulator substrate. Our approach takes advantage of the creeping properties of SiO2 at the usual GaN epitaxial growth temperature, allowing the GaN crystallites to align and reduce the grain boundary dislocations. Furthermore, this bottom-up approach allows to get rid of the dry plasma etching step for μLEDs fabrication, which highly deteriorates sidewalls, reducing the efficiency of future displays.

High fill factor CNT films with easy accessibility are lifted above the sapphire patterns and introduce a second selective area growth subsequent to the micron-scale selective area growth on PSS, leading to a further reduction in threading dislocation density (TDD) without involving any regrowth process. Under this dislocation prevention effect, the TDD of the GaN epilayer dropped to 3.5 × 107 cm-2 consequently, which is 78% lower than that on PSS. A thermal transporting network of CNTs with high axial thermal conductivity is simultaneously established, contributing to the great improvement in the thermal performance of the near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (LED) fabricated subsequently. As a result, an 89% increase in saturation light output power and a 55.5% enhancement in internal quantum efficiency were acquired. We thus believe that this convenient yet effective method will be a competitive solution for short-wavelength LED devices that require high efficiency and long lifetime.  © ","carbon nanotubes; gallium nitride; MOCVD; near ultraviolet LED; patterned sapphire substrates","Carbon nanotubes; Energy efficiency; Epilayers; Gallium nitride; III-V semiconductors; Light emitting diodes; Sapphire; Substrates; Thermal conductivity; Carbon nanotubes films; High quality; Near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode; Patterned sapphire substrate; Selective area growth; Thermal Performance; Thermal transport; Threading dislocation densities; Transport networks; UV LEDs; Carbon films","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118760932"

However, choosing the appropriate refactoring strategy is not always straightforward, resulting in developers seeking assistance. Although research in refactoring is well-established, with several studies altering between the detection of refactoring opportunities and the recommendation of appropriate code changes, little is known about their adoption in practice. Analyzing the perception of developers is critical to understand better what developers consider to be problematic in their code and how they handle it. Additionally, there is a need for bridging the gap between refactoring, as research, and its adoption in practice, by extracting common refactoring intents that are more suitable for what developers face in reality. In this study, we analyze refactoring discussions on Stack Overflow through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our results show that Stack Overflow is utilized by a diverse set of developers for refactoring assistance for a variety of technologies. Our observations show five areas that developers typically require help with refactoring– Code Optimization, Tools and IDEs, Architecture and Design Patterns, Unit Testing, and Database. We envision our findings better bridge the support between traditional (or academic) aspects of refactoring and their real-world applicability, including better tool support. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Empirical study; Refactoring; Software maintenance and evolution; Stack Overflow","Codes (symbols); Code changes; Code optimization; Empirical studies; Internal quality; Qualitative experiments; Quantitative experiments; Refactorings; Software maintenance and evolution; Stack overflow; Technical debts; Computer software maintenance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117733907"

As one of the widely used substrates, sapphire shows superiority for heteroepitaxial growth of III-nitride light-emitting diode (LED) structure, due to the advantages of stability, low cost, high mechanical strength, as well as mature fabrication technology. However, realization of efficient LEDs grown on sapphire substrate is impeded by high density of defects in epilayers and low light extraction efficiency. The emergence of patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) turns out to be a promising and effective technology to overcome these problems and enhance the LED performances. In this review, we first introduce the background and recent advances of PSS applied in III-nitride visible and ultraviolet LEDs are. Then, we summarize the fabrication methods of PSS, together with novel methods to define nanometre-scale patterned structures. We further demonstrate the effect of PSS that contributes to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) of epilayers in detail. Meanwhile, mechanism of light extraction efficiency enhancement by adopting PSS is presented based on numerical analysis. Next, we explore the influence of PSS structural parameters (e.g. pattern size, pattern shape and aspect ratio) on LED performances, spanning from visible to deep ultraviolet UV emission region. Finally, challenges and potential prospects in PSS for future LED development are proposed and forecasted as well. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Aspect ratio; Efficiency; Epilayers; Extraction; Nitrides; Sapphire; Substrates; Diode structure; High mechanical strength; High resolution display; III-Nitride; Light-extraction efficiency; Lightemitting diode; Low-costs; Patterned sapphire substrate; Performance; Solid state lighting; Light emitting diodes","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127893055"

D-TDD dynamically changes the TDD configuration of a cell without interrupting users' connectivity, hence balancing the bandwidth for UL or DL communication according to the traffic pattern. However, 3GPP standard does not specify algorithms or solutions to derive the TDD configuration, i.e., the number of slots to dedicate to UL and DL. In [1], we have proposed a Machine Learning (ML)-based solution relaying on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to allow the base station (or gNB) to self-adapt to the traffic pattern of the cell by periodically adapting the number of slots dedicated to UL and DL. In this work, we implemented the DRL algorithm on top of an open-source gNB based on OpenAirInterface (OAI) [2] to demonstrate its efficiency. To this end, we relied on the O-RAN architecture [3], where the proposed DRL algorithm is deployed as xApp at the Near Real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and communicates with the base station using O-RAN E2 interface. We developed xTDD Service Model (SM) following the E2SM standard [3], allowing the DRL solution to monitor DL and UL buffers from the gNB to deduce the optimal TDD configuration that accommodates the current traffic. Then, the decision (i.e., TDD configuration) is pushed to the base station. We implemented the solution on top of the OAI 5G StandAlone (SA) platform and Flexric RIC [4]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a ML-based D-TDD on top of a real 5G network, showing the advantage of O-RAN architecture to building Self Organized Network (SON) function for dynamic configuration of D-TDD. © 2023 IEEE.","","5G mobile communication systems; Balancing; Deep learning; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Reinforcement learning; Time division multiplexing; Downlink traffics; Dynamic time; Intelligent controllers; Machine-learning; RAN architecture; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Reinforcement learnings; Traffic demands; Traffic pattern; Uplink communication; Base stations","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164688380"

Designs are required to pass sign-off design rule check (DRC) before tape-out. Foundries rely on DRC to ensure designs they accept are manufacturable. DRC runsets must be accurate, complete, and reliable. DRC runset qualification is critical in technology node deployment and maturation. The number, complexity and variation of design rules grow dramatically with advancing technology nodes. This increases the QA challenge to ensure quality and accuracy of runsets and their interdependent rule operations. Traditional methods of migrating previous node QA patterns, manually crafting new testcases, and targeted-pattern generation leave gaps in advanced process node qualification coverage. We deploy a novel synthetic layout generation approach to produce large varieties of complex layouts with high design space coverage to thoroughly qualify runsets, make runset improvements and release quality PDKs. We employ guided random Monte Carlo layout generation with user-defined layout construction rules. User-defined rules inform DRC requirements and assign weighted priorities to guide layout design styles. We generate stress DR layouts and high pattern coverage, with DRC-clean patterns and with deliberate DRC violations, to validate expected DRC results and exercise entire rule decks. In this paper, we show how Synthetic Layout Generation is integrated into runset QA flows, automatically generating stress DR conditions that manual efforts often miss, expand layout pattern space coverage, and improve runset execution coverage leading to higher quality on-time PDK development, qualification, and release. © 2022 SPIE.","Design Enablement; DRC Runset; DRC Unit Testing; DTCO; LSG; Synthetic layout generation; Synthetic test case generation","Design enablement; Design rule check runset; Design rule check unit testing; Design rule checks; DTCO; Layout generations; LSG; Synthetic layout generation; Synthetic test case generation; Synthetic tests; Test case generation; Unit testing; Product design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145436460"

Orleans is a good choice for either of these scenarios as the next step to build your backend services and reduce unnecessary orchestration, overhead, and tooling. The Orleans framework was designed to handle tedious overhead, allowing the developer to focus on the solution. You will learn how Orleans can support billions of virtually parallel transactions while sustaining low latency and high availability. In addition, you will glimpse under the hood at Orleans to discover its useful attributes. All key learning points include hands-on coding examples to reinforce understanding. This book goes beyond what Orleans is to explain where it fits within the realm of development. You will gain an in-depth understanding to build a foundation for future growth. What You Will Learn: Understand how Orleans can benefit your monolithic and/or microservice applications; Gain a brief overview of actor models and how they relate to Orleans; Observe the design patterns and how Orleans can simplify or reduce tooling requirements; Know the pros and cons of microservices and Orleans to determine the best course of action based on the needs of an application; Discover Orleans' design patterns and practices, including life cycle, messaging guarantees, cluster management, streams, load balancing, and more; Build your first Orleans' application; build base knowledge of application structure, unit testing, dashboard, scheduled events; Who This Book Is For: This book is for developers. A basic understanding of.NET development and an understanding of service concepts is helpful. Readers will need a connection to download Nuget packages and a code editor (Community Edition Visual Studio or VS Code). © 2022 by Thomas Nelson.

Many massive MIMO deployments use time-division duplex (TDD), thereby opening the door for the potential use of full-duplex at base-stations. In this paper, we present LensFD, a scalable method to enable cost-effective massive MIMO full-duplex operation in sub-6 GHz frequencies with a focus on the CBRS band of 3.5 GHz. LensFD uses a low-cost lens array combined with transmit precoding to reshape the effective beam pattern of antennas in massive MIMO arrays to reduce self-interference. We tested three lens configurations in LensFD experimentally with a software-defined 40-antenna base-station and demonstrate a significant improvement in self-interference reduction and hence overall increased system capacity to 1.6× over the TDD counterpart. As an important contribution, we will open-source the large measurement dataset from our experiments. © 2023 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

We assume that the Tx aperture transmits one beam to an active communication user (downlink communication of time division duplex) and another beam for sensing the passive target, and the Rx aperture receives backscattered sensing signals simultaneously (full duplex). The array apertures' design criteria are based on the effect of interference mitigation when using linear beamforming. The optimal solution is determined when the side lobes for the beams are minimized at different scanning angles in the field of view. Our numerical results indicate that the near-optimal antenna allocation for the apertures does not perform uniformly for all desired beam directions, but yet, we could conclude a near-optimal solution based on the least discrepancy between the sidelobe suppression effects for the aperture patterns.  © 2022 IEEE.","6G; interference mitigation; joint communication and sensing; planar array apertures","Antenna lobes; Beam forming networks; Optimal systems; Radar antennas; Scanning antennas; 6g; Co-located; Fixed numbers; Interference mitigation; Joint communication and sensing; Planar array aperture; Planar arrays; Radar sensing; Receivers (Rx); Transmitters (Tx); Genetic algorithms","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128668742"

In this paper, we propose a novel QoS guaranteed joint resource allocation framework for NR with supplementary uplink (SUL) called QGJRA-SUL, where three parameters of SUL admission, TDD pattern, and band slicing scheme are jointly optimized. The framework is driven by a well-designed deep reinforcement learning agent. By combining the activation functions tanh and softmax, the agent can jointly optimize three parameters at the same time. Under the original problem of QoS satisfaction rate maximization, we introduce the load unbalance degree of slices into the reward function as a penalty term. The simulation results show that the framework can guarantee the QoS satisfaction rate well and balance the load of slices. QGJRA-SUL can accommodate 15% more user equipments (UEs) with the same QoS satisfaction rate than that of a traditional single-band solution without SUL, and achieve a 73% increase in the performance of load balancing than that without a load balancing mechanism near the full load. © 2023 by the authors.","deep reinforcement learning; network slicing; supplementary uplink","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152914513"

On page 3: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces needed to be changed. The notation has been corrected in the following paragraphs: “They are overgrown in the lateral 〈1120〉 directions during many crystallization processes (due to the slender shape of the seed sticks mainly in the [1120] and [1120] directions). After reaching the desired lateral size, the crystals are joined in pairs by tiling in order to obtain a larger crystal. To multiply lateral overgrowth and tiling requires continuous mechanical processing of the crystals in the stage of their preparation for a given growth run. The crystals are mainly trimmed and lapped in a proper way. Figure 1 represents a scheme of the multi regrowth of a slender GaN seed and a scheme of combining two newly-grown, already separated from their seeds, crystals by tiling technology. When the combined crystals reach the correct size by growth in the lateral 〈1120〉 as well as the vertical [0001] crystallographic directions (growth in the latter direction is not marked), they are used for preparing substrates, shown in Figure 1. As already mentioned, then the wafering procedures are applied.” 2. On page 4: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in Figure 1 caption needed to be changed. The notation has been corrected in the caption: “Scheme of the substrate manufacturing steps starting from slender GaN seeds to the finished wafer: Step 1, multi regrowth of a slender GaN seed in the lateral 〈1120〉 directions; three new-grown crystal areas crystallized in three separated processes are marked; Step 2, new crystal sliced from the overgrown seed of Step 1; Step 3, two cut out crystals are joined together by tiling technology; Step 4, GaN continues to grow in the lateral 〈1120〉 directions as well as in vertical [0001] direction in multi regrowth steps; Step 5, when the necessary size is reached the as-grown GaN crystals can be drilled, sliced and polished in a proper way to produce wafers.” 3. On page 6: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence “The bars are perpendicular to one of the fastest growth directions, e.g., the (1120) direction and its opposite direction (1120), but initially not to the four symmetrically equivalent (2110), (2110), (1210) and (1210)” should be “The bars are perpendicular to one of the fastest growth directions, e.g., the [1120] directions and its opposite direction [1120], but initially not to the four symmetrically equivalent [2110], [2110], [1210] and [1210]”. The (1120) in the following sentence has been corrected: “While in the first seed enlargement steps growth was limited to only two directions, in the later course seed enlargement typically occurred in all type 〈1120〉 directions and areas with ultra-low TDD emerged at the wafer edge in all these six possible directions.” 4. On page 7: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “In the case of substrate B, six lines of contrast running parallel to the [1100] direction are observed. Four of the contrast lines appear bright and two of the contrast lines appear dark. This effect is caused by a slight bending of the basal plane at the tiling seam as it forms a grain boundary. The overall pattern of line structures can be described as chains of threading dislocation bundles. The main course in the depth of the dislocation bundles is along the 〈0001〉 direction.” has been corrected. On page 8: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the end of this defect pattern is limited in the [1120] and [1120] direction by areas that were formed in a subsequent generation of the crystal growth process.” has been corrected. On page 10: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “The growth front of the Am-GaN crystal proceeded from right to left in [1120] direction.” has been corrected. The notation in the sentence: “It should be kept in mind that not only in the lateral direction, but also in the vertical [0001] growth direction, phenomena such as growth bands and striations are typically present in ammonothermally grown GaN due to the regrowth steps, as was already shown by Sintonen et al. [39]. Another observation that can be made in the section of the two topographs (Figure 9) is that TDD gradually decreases in the lateral [1120] growth direction; to the right of the growth band TDD is the highest, in the growth band area itself there is a medium TDD and to the left of the growth band TDD is lowest.” has also been corrected. On page 11: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentences: “These dislocations appear like a network forming a continuous wall that extends perpendicularly to the [1210].”; “Again, as with the example before (Figure 9), separated areas of distinct TDD can be observed for the different lateral regrowth areas with the lowest TDD in the regrowth area at the outer edge in the [1210] direction”; and “The DB chains always run along an a-plane {1120} growth facet.” has been corrected. On page 12: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “The outer edges of the hexagons always run along the a-plane {1120} prismatic facets and these clusters can reach the size of more than 1 mm edge length for the wafers investigated here (and more than 2 mm edge length for substrates examined in other studies).” has been corrected. On page 13: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “The single and chain-like DBs are defects that are manifested in the growth steps of seed crystal enlargement and always arrange themselves along a-plane {1120} facets. It is shown that these DBs arise not only at the interface between two regions of different regrowth steps (as in the example of a DB chain visible in Figure 12b), but they also can arise suddenly in the middle of a seed enlargement growth phase (as in all examples shown for single DBs (Figure 11) and the DB chain of Figure 12b). The formation point of the DBs with honeycomb structure (Figure 13) is currently less clear. It could be during the growth for seed crystal enlargement along a-plane {1120} facets or at the growth in the vertical [0001] directions.” has been corrected. On page 15: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “It should be remarked that a 1–2 orders of magnitude lower TD is found in the most recent grown areas in the lateral 〈1120〉 direction.” has been corrected.

In the system, macro cell users (M-UEs), V2V clusters (V-Clusters) and V2V nodes are distributed in the time-division duplex (TDD) cellular networks, where all users share the cellular uplink resources for spectrum access. M-UEs and V-Clusters adopt orthogonal access patterns. V2V nodes expect to obtain an optimal strategy to reuse other users' resource for access while preventing other users from serious interference, which is difficult due to the limited information of other users' access patterns. Thus, DRL technology is used to train V2V nodes in an unsupervised way, where the spectrum access can be optimized without any prior information. Specifically, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) based hybrid spectrum access (D2HSA) algorithm is designed for maximizing the sum throughput of the HetNets, which makes the V2V nodes intelligently select suitable frames for spectrum access. Furthermore, in order to improve the stability of individual throughput for V2V nodes, the proposed algorithm is adjusted by considering stability in the design of the objective function. Last, the experiment results illustrate that our proposed scheme could reach an optimal throughput referring to the theoretic limit for different cases, and the performance greatly outperforms the scheme relying on the cooperation of base station. © 2022 IEEE.","deep reinforcement learning; Heterogeneous network; hybrid spectrum access; V2V communication","Deep learning; Reinforcement learning; Time division multiplexing; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Cellulars; Deep reinforcement learning; Hybrid spectrum access; Learning technology; Macro cells; Reinforcement learnings; Spectrum access; Time division duplex; V2V communications; Vehicle to vehicles; Heterogeneous networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149151765"

To investigate the effect of HPSS, the threading dislocation densities (TDDs) of AlN films grown simultaneously on HPSS and flat sapphire substrate (FSS) are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The corresponding TDD is measured to be 4.38 × 108 cm−2 for the AlN sample grown on HPSS, which is significantly lower than the value of 1.48 × 109 cm−2 on the FSS. The usability of the AlN/HPSS template for deep ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is proven by growth of AlGaN-based LED structure emitting at 278 nm with single peak emission in a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition reactor. The light output power of flip-chip LED grown and fabricated on AlN/HPSS template is enhanced by a factor of 1.25 when compared with LED on AlN/FSS template at 350 mA injecting current.

Following this pattern in test cases may benefit comprehension, debugging, and maintenance. The AAA structure of real-life test cases may not be explicit due to its high complexity. Manually labeling AAA statements in test cases is tedious. Thus, an automated approach for labeling AAA statements in existing test cases could benefit new developers and projects that practice collective code ownership and test driven development. This study contributes an automatic approach based on machine learning models. The ""secret sauce""of this approach is a set of three learning features that are based on the semantic, syntax, and context information in test cases, derived from the manual tagging process. Thus, our approach mimics how developers may manually tag the AAA pattern of a test case. We assess the precision, recall, and F-1 score of our approach based on 449 test cases, containing about 16,612 statements, across 4 Apache open source projects. For achieving the best performance in our approach, we explore the usage of six machine learning models; the contribution of the SMOTE data balancing technique; the comparison of the three learning features; and the comparison of five different methods for calculating the semantic feature. The results show our approach is able to identify Arrangement, Action, and Assertion statements with a precision upwards of 92%, and recall up to 74%.

In this paper, we study the PLS of a polar-coded wireless communication system. To be more specific, we leverage the unique properties in polar code construction and propose a channel quality indicator (CQI)-based frozen-bit pattern generation scheme. The transmitter employs the Gaussian approxima-tion algorithm to generate the corresponding frozen bit pattern according to the instantaneous CQI of the legitimate link. At the receiver, by leveraging the full channel reciprocity in the time-division duplex (TDD) mode, we can map the CQI to the corresponding frozen bit pattern and correctly decode the received bits. By contrast, the eavesdropper was unable to have the knowledge of the le-gal channel, and hence cannot determine the frozen bit pattern of the polar-coded bit sequence. Our simulation results demonstrate that by adopting the proposed PLS key generation scheme, Eve was hardly able to correctly decode a complete frame, leading to a high block error rate (BLER), while Bob was able to attain a 10−5 BLER. © 2022 by the authors.

Over the last decade, there are few attempts to study test smells in the context of system tests that interact with the System Under Test through a Graphical User Interface. To fill the gap, we conduct an exploratory analysis of test smells occurring in System User Interactive Tests (SUIT). We thus, compose a catalog of 35 SUIT-specific smells, identified through a multi-vocal literature review, and show how they differ from smells encountered in unit tests. We also conduct an empirical analysis to assess the diffuseness and removal of these smells in 48 industrial repositories and 12 open-source projects. Our results show that the same type of smells tends to appear in both industrial and open-source projects, but they are not addressed in the same way. We also find that smells originating from a combination of multiple code locations appear more often than those that are localized on a single line. This happens because of the difficulty to observe non-local smells without tool support. Furthermore, we find that smell-removing actions are not frequent with less than 50% of the affected tests ever undergoing a smell removal. Interestingly, while smell-removing actions are rare, some smells disappear while discarding tests, i.e., these smells do not appear in follow-up tests that replace the discarded ones. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","GUI tests; Multivocal literature review; Refactoring; System user interface tests; Test smells","Odors; Open source software; Software testing; Design and implementations; Development practices; GUI test; Literature reviews; Multivocal literature review; Open source projects; Refactorings; System test; System user interface test; Test smell; Graphical user interfaces","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144233627"

Since the channel gain value is not exchanged between the legitimate transmitter and the desired receiver, eavesdroppers cannot ascertain the frozen bit pattern engaged in the legitimate polar coding. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, eavesdroppers are unable to appropriately decode the confidential information delivered over the legitimate link. As the SNR increases, eavesdroppers may have chance to sort out the correct frozen bit pattern through a brute-force search. However, this chance is significantly reduced by our SOPC. We design the SOPC for both single-input-single-output single-antenna eavesdropper (SISOSE) and multiple-input-multiple-output multi-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) channels. Its PLS functioning is assessed in terms of the error rate difference between the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Illustrative simulation results substantiate that the SOPC design guarantees degraded decoding performance at eavesdroppers, for both SISOSE and MIMOME channels, even in the presence of a powerful eavesdropper possessing infinite computational resources. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","channel gain; frozen bits; Physical layer security (PLS); security-oriented polar coding (SOPC); time division duplexing (TDD)","Antennas; Channel coding; Channel estimation; Decoding; MIMO systems; Network layers; Signal encoding; Signal receivers; Transmitters; Channel gains; Encodings; Frozen bits; Physical layer security; Receiver; Security; Security-oriented polar coding; Time division duplexing; Wireless communications; Signal to noise ratio","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125292934"

In older patient populations, there has been effort placed in reducing exposure to potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs). After years of reducing exposure of older adults in our hospitals to PIMs through multi-component interventions, our system chose to expand the scope and attempt a new strategy to lessen alert burden for providers and pharmacists. Based on the American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria and internal data, a passive CDS approach, termed “geriatric context” was established to recommend appropriate medication selection including lower dosage amounts and frequency of administration in older adults. Methods: Retrospective descriptive study examining change in a pre and post implementation analysis of medication usage patterns between two 9-month time periods in 2019 and 2021 in patients age ≥65 years across an 8-hospital health system. The primary endpoint is the percentage of each medication intervened with an ordered dose and frequency outside of alignment with recommended context parameters. Secondary endpoints include total daily dose (TDD) and average dose (AD) per patient of the individual PIMs. Exploratory endpoints include frequency of active alerts fired by the CPOE and overridden by providers. Results: A total of 62,738 older adult hospital admissions are included in the overall study period, with 32,969 pre-implementation and 29,769 post-implementation. Haloperidol showed the greatest reduction in inappropriate doses from 41.5% to 21.4% (p < 0.001) of orders, followed by reduction in inappropriate frequencies in orders for diphenhydramine from 57.2% to 39.7% (p < 0.001). Secondary endpoints showed favorable reductions across 11 of the 16 medications in both TDD and AD administered. Exploratory analysis with select medications showed reductions in frequency of alerts fired and overridden. Conclusions: Utilization of a passive CDS positively influences prescribing patterns for older adults and reduces the alert burden to ordering providers. © 2023 The American Geriatrics Society.","CPOE; geriatric; medication safety; passive CDS; quality improvement","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170678343"

In particular, the trip distance distribution (TDD) is a direct input to the bathtub model in the new space dimension, and is a very important variable to consider in many applications, such as the development of distance-based congestion pricing strategies or mileage tax. For a good understanding of the demand pattern, both the distribution of trip initiation and trip distance should be calibrated from real data. In this paper, it is assumed that the demand pattern can be described by the joint distribution of trip distance and departure time. In other words, TDD is assumed to be time-dependent, and a calibration and validation methodology of the joint probability is proposed, based on log-likelihood maximization and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The calibration method is applied to empirical for-hire vehicle trips in Chicago, and it is concluded that TDD varies more within a day than across weekdays. The hypothesis that TDD follows a negative exponential, log-normal, or Gamma distribution is rejected. However, the best fit is systematically observed for the time-dependent log-normal probability density function. In the future, other trip distributions should be considered and also non-parametric probability density estimation should be explored for a better understanding of the demand pattern. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.","","Calibration; Computational complexity; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Traffic congestion; Chicago; Demand pattern; Departure time; Distance distributions; Distance-based; Space dimensions; Time dependent; Transportation system analysis; Trip demand; Trip distances; Vehicles","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120033910"

Deprecation is commonly used as a tool to manage multiple versions of methods or services. However, deprecation carries a cost in that tests might be duplicated and might rely on services that have become deprecated over time. Objective Using the terms of the Technical Debt metaphor, we explore the consequences of deprecation, and how it has affected the test base during seven years. Method We take an exploratory approach, reporting on experiences found before and after servicing parts of the incurred Technical Debt. We mine code repositories and validate our findings with experienced developers. Results We found that the growth of deprecation debt varied a lot. Some services experienced substantial growth, but most did not. Unit tests, where deprecation is visible in the developers' tools, were much less affected than integration tests, which lack such visualization mechanisms. While servicing debt of 121 out of 285 deprecated services, we discovered that up to 29% of the spent effort could be attributed to accrued interest. However, this is an upper bound; there could be less impact, depending on whether scripting could be used to service the debt or not. Conclusion This paper illustrates that integration tests can be viewed as a debt from the perspective of deprecated services. While the pattern was that deprecated services (debt principal) experienced no or little accrued interest, some, highly used, services experienced a lot, particularly during stressful times. Java-based tests, where deprecation is visible in the IDE, did not experience a similar pattern of increasing debt.

Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 97 852 patients from 11 Asian countries/regions (2007–2017) included in the prospective Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register. Results: Among 18 998 insulin users (47% women, mean ± SD age 59.2 ± 11.7 years, diabetes duration 13.2 ± 8.3 years, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 72 ± 21.4 mmol/mol [8.74 ± 1.95%], median total daily insulin dose [TDD] 0.27–0.82 units/kg), 25% and 29.5% had YOD and DKD, respectively. Premixed (44%) and basal-only (42%) insulin were the most common regimens. Despite being more commonly treated with these two regimens with higher insulin dosages, patients with YOD had worse HbA1c levels than their late-onset peers (73 ± 20.5 vs. 71 ± 21.2 mmol/mol [8.82 ± 1.87% vs. 8.66 ± 1.94%]; P < 0.001). Fewer women than men attained an HbA1c level < 53 mmol/mol (7%; 15.7% vs 17.1%; P = 0.018). Adjusting for age, diabetes duration, TDD, HbA1c, eGFR, and use of oral glucose-lowering drugs at baseline, the odds of self-reported hypoglycaemia were higher in women (vs. men: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.28) and in patients with DKD treated with a premixed regimen (1.81 [95% CI 1.54–2.13] vs. 1.34 [95% CI 1.16–1.54] in non-DKD; Pinteraction < 0.001). Compared to basal-only regimens, premixed and basal-bolus regimens had similar HbA1c reductions but were independently associated with increased odds of hypoglycaemia (1.65 [95% CI 1.45–1.88] and 1.88 [95% CI 1.58–2.23], respectively). Conclusions: In this Asian population, there were varying patterns of insulin regimens with suboptimal glycaemic control, despite relatively high TDDs, which were influenced by gender, DKD, and YOD status. © 2020 The Authors.

Studies have found that developers can accurately determine whether a string matches a regular expression. However, we still do not know the challenges associated with composing regular expressions. We conduct an exploratory case study to reveal the tools and strategies developers use during regular expression composition. In this study, 29 students are tasked with composing regular expressions that pass unit tests illustrating the intended behavior. The tasks are in Java and the Eclipse IDE was set up with JUnit tests. Participants had one hour to work and could use any Eclipse tools, web search, or web-based tools they desired. Screen-capture software recorded all interactions with browsers and the IDE. We analyzed the videos quantitatively by transcribing logs and extracting personas. Our results show that participants were 30% successful (28 of 94 attempts) at achieving a 100% pass rate on the unit tests. When participants used tools frequently, as in the case of the novice tester and the knowledgeable tester personas, or when they guess at a solution prior to searching, they are more likely to pass all the unit tests. We also found that compile errors often arise when participants searched for a result and copy/pasted the regular expression from another language into their Java files. These results point to future research into making regular expression composition easier for programmers, such as integrating visualization into the IDE to reduce context switching or providing language migration support when reusing regular expressions written in another language to reduce compile errors. © 2019 IEEE.","Exploratory study; Personas; Problem solving strategies; Regular expressions","Integrodifferential equations; Pattern matching; Websites; Context switching; Exploratory case studies; Exploratory studies; Language migrations; Personas; Programming projects; Regular expressions; Web-based tools; Java programming language","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072335567"

We propose an approach of using dynamic symbolic execution for generating automated test cases and corresponding database states for stored procedures. We model the constraints on data imposed by the schema and the SQL statements, treating values in database tables as symbolic. We use SMT solver to find values that will drive the stored procedure on a particular execution path. We instrument the internal execution plans generated by PostgreSQL to extract constraints. We use Z3 to generate test cases consisting of table data and procedure inputs. Our evaluation using stored procedures from a large business application and various GitHub repositories quantifies the evidence of effectiveness of our technique by generating test cases that lead to schema constraint violations and user-defined exceptions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Automated testing; Database; Stored procedures; Symbolic execution","Automation; Database systems; Digital storage; Model checking; Automated testing; Database tables; Dynamic symbolic executions; Execution paths; Execution plans; Schema constraints; Stored procedures; Symbolic execution; Automatic test pattern generation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068909745"

A developer could easily and quickly catch and fix software faults introduced in the source code by creating and running unit tests. Despite their importance, unit tests are subject to bad design or implementation decisions, the so-called test smells. These might decrease software systems’ quality from various aspects, making it harder to understand, more complex to maintain, and more prone to errors and bugs. Many studies discuss the likely effects of test smells on test code. However, there is a lack of studies that capture developers’ perceptions of such issues. This study empirically analyzes how developers perceive the severity of test smells in the test code they develop. Severity refers to the degree to how a test smell may negatively impact the test code. We selected six open-source software projects from GitHub and interviewed their developers to understand whether and how the test smells affected the test code. Although most of the interviewed developers considered the test smells as having a low severity to their code, they indicated that test smells might negatively impact the project, particularly in test code maintainability and evolution. Also, detecting and removing test smells from the test code may be positive for the project. © CIbSE 2021.

To accomplish this, we first analyzed some 1,500 open-source projects to elicit severity thresholds for commonly found test smells. Then, we conducted a study with developers to evaluate our thresholds. We found that (1) current detection rules for certain test smells are considered as too strict by the developers and (2) our newly defined severity thresholds are in line with the participants' perception of how test smells have an impact on the maintainability of a test suite.

Hence, it has attracted increasing attention from researchers of wireless communication community. In this paper1, the information secrecy issue for MBM is investigated, and a secure single-input-multiple-output MBM (SIMO-MBM) system is proposed utilizing physical-layer security techniques. By considering the time-division duplexing (TDD) mode with channel reciprocity property, the legitimate channel state information (CSI) is applied to secure the data transmission of SIMO-MBM. More specifically, on one hand, adaptive phase rotation is imposed on the transmitted signals, where the rotation angle is determined by the phase of legitimate CSI; on the other hand, the mapping rule between the mirror activation pattern and binary bits is changed according to the amplitude of legitimate CSI. The BER performance of the eavesdropper is investigated via theoretical derivations, and the system secrecy mutual information is also derived, based on which the optimal design of the adaptive phase rotation strategy is provided. Theoretical and simulative results demonstrate that the proposed secure SIMO-MBM system is capable of enhancing the data confidentiality whilst keeping reliable data transmission. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","adaptive phase rotation; channel state information; dynamic mapping rule; index modulation; Media-based modulation; physical-layer security","Bit error rate; Channel capacity; Chemical activation; Data transfer; Mirrors; Modulation; Bit error rate (BER) performance; Data confidentiality; Physical layer security; Reliable data transmission; Single input multiple outputs; Theoretical derivations; Time division duplexing; Wireless communications; Channel state information","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083857125"

However, this feature is limited by two additional types of interference between cells in opposite transmission direction: downlink (DL) to uplink (UL) and UL to DL interference. Therefore, using this mode with macrocell deployments requires interference mitigation techniques to reduce the strong DL to UL interference. 3D beamforming is an efficient technique that minimizes interference and enhances performance by exploiting a large 2D array of antennas intelligently. Combining D-TDD and 3D beamforming can make DTDD feasible for macro-cells. The aim of this work is to provide a 3D beamforming analytical model in a D-TDD based macro-cells' deployment where beamforming horizontal and vertical radiation patterns depend on the spatial distribution of random users' locations. We evaluate interference in terms of Interference to Signal Ratio (ISR). We show that the cumulative ISR can be written in terms of convergent series and its expectation is an almost sure convergent series.

OBJECTIVE: To understand patient characteristics, dosing, adherence, and persistence related to high-dose insulin therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that used administrative claims from a large national health plan. Patients were identified who had been diagnosed with T2DM and who were aged 18-89 years, enrolled in a commercial or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan, newly initiated on a total daily dose (TDD) >200 units of insulin between January 2011 and August 2015. Patients were required to be enrolled 6 months before and 12 months after the index date. Patients were categorized to Regimen-100 if treated with U-100 insulin only or Regimen-500 if treated with U-500R with or without U-100. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. An adjustment factor for the days supply was calculated as the ratio of median time between insulin claims, and median pharmacy reported days supply for each insulin prescription. Adjusted days supply, quantity, and concentration were used to calculate TDD for each quarter after the index date. Adherence was measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC) for each regimen. Persistence was measured in 2 ways: the percentage of patients remaining on index medications in each quarter and the proportion of patients who maintained TDD>200 units during all 4 quarters of the 12-month post-index period. RESULTS: We identified 2,339 patients newly titrated up to TDD>200 units on either Regimen-100 (2,062, 88.2%) or Regimen-500 (277, 11.8%). Patients on Regimen-500 were slightly younger with higher prevalence of comorbidities. The mean TDD (SD) for Regimen-100 decreased from 228.6 (36.0) units during the first quarter to 194.2 (181.4) units during the last quarter. The mean TDD (SD) for Regimen-500 increased from 294.2 (102.2) units in the first quarter to 304.8 (281.6) units in last quarter. The average adherence to the high-dose insulin regimen was 68.2% (30.7; median 72.6%) for the Regimen-100 cohort and 75.5% (27.0; median 85.2%) for the Regimen-500 cohort. In the Regimen-100 and Regimen-500 cohorts, 45.3% and 55.2% had a PDC≥80%, respectively. Only 23.0% and 51.6% of patients maintained TDD>200 units for the Regimen-100 and Regimen-500 cohorts, respectively, throughout the 4 quarters after the index date. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that many patients did not maintain high-dose insulin use over time, especially those on standard U-100 insulin only. This dosing pattern appears to reflect the differences in patient characteristics, insulin needs, and adherence/persistence behavior between those on Regimen-100 and those on Regimen-500. © 2020, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

Due to the low reservoir and fluid description accuracy, the variation in flow patterns, and the difficulty to predict flow pattern by simulation of carbonate fractured-vuggy reservoirs in a burial depth of 6500m, the transverse flow in water injection is prone to cause abrupt watered-out wells, resulting in a low recovery rate of only 14.9%. Development and production in such reservoirs are a world-class problem. After many years of research and practice, we developed a series of technologies to enhance oil recovery, including geophysical description, geological modeling, water and gas injection, and acid fracturing. The developed STOOIP has increased 42% with an EOR(enhanced oil recovery) of 2.3 percent in the structural units tested with the new technologies, which are applicable to the development of similar deep or ultra-deep reservoirs with strong heterogeneity. © 2020, OIL & GAS GEOLOGY Editorial Board.

The NCPSS, with a hexagonal non-close-packed nano-cavity pattern on the sapphire substrate, was fabricated by polystyrene sphere coating and size reduction by reactive ion etching, followed by deposition of alumina and thermal oxidation. The coalescence of GaN on the NCPSS was achieved by the formation of relatively large GaN islands and enhanced lateral overgrowth of the GaN islands over several nano-cavity pattern areas. The threading dislocation density (TDD) measured by cathodoluminescence measurement was significantly reduced from 2.4 × 108 cm−2 to 6.9 × 107 cm−2 by using the NCPSS. A dislocation behavior that contributes to the reduction of TDD of the GaN layer was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the compressive stress in the GaN layer was reduced by 21% due to the embedded nano-cavities. In addition, the diffuse reflectance of GaN on the NCPSS was enhanced by 54% ∼ 62%, which is attributed to the increased probability of light extraction through effective light scattering by nano-cavities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","A1.

In this paper, we explore a third solution: to automatically improve existing test cases written by developers. We present the concept, design and implementation of a system called DSpot, that takes developer-written test cases as input (JUnit tests in Java) and synthesizes improved versions of them as output. Those test improvements are given back to developers as patches or pull requests, that can be directly integrated in the main branch of the test code base. We have evaluated DSpot in a deep, systematic manner over 40 real-world unit test classes from 10 notable and open-source software projects. We have amplified all test methods from those 40 unit test classes. In 26/40 cases, DSpot is able to automatically improve the test under study, by triggering new behaviors and adding new valuable assertions. Next, for ten projects under consideration, we have proposed a test improvement automatically synthesized by DSpot to the lead developers. In total, 13/19 proposed test improvements were accepted by the developers and merged into the main code base. This shows that DSpot is capable of automatically improving unit-tests in real-world, large scale Java software. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Junit test; Pull request empirical study; Test improvement","Java programming language; Open source software; Open systems; Software testing; Automatically generated; Design and implementations; Empirical studies; Java software; Open source projects; Open source software projects; Real-world; Test method; Automatic test pattern generation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064832264"

However, there is little data investigating the insulin dose setting during CSII therapy in type 2 diabetes to achieve optimal glycemic control and avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, this study is aimed to assess the dose characteristics of insulin requirement and explore the related clinical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with CSII. A total of 327 patients (195 males) aged 52.9±12.5 years old were included in this study. Patients were treated with CSII to achieve the target fasting capillary blood glucose (4.4–7.0 mmol L-1) and 2-h postprandial capillary blood glucose (4.4–10.0 mmol L-1) by adjusting insulin infusion according to the seven-point capillary blood glucose profiles. Total daily insulin dose (TDD), total daily insulin dose per kilogram (TDD kg-1) and the ratio of total basal insulin dose (TBD) to TDD (%TBa) were calculated after patients achieved the glucose targets for at least 3 days via 1–2 weeks of CSII treatment. And insulin dose, insulin dosing patterns and the relevant clinical factors were analyzed. The mean ratio of basal/bolus insulin distribution of all patients was 40%:60%. Patients with central obesity needed more TDD (51.3±17.1 U versus 43.5±14.0 U, P<0.05) and TDD kg-1 (0.8±0.3 U kg-1 versus 0.7±0.2 U kg-1, P<0.05) than those without central obesity. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that TDD was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting C-peptide level, 2 h-postprandial C-peptide level and time to achieve glycemic target (all P<0.05); TDD kg-1 was positively correlated with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), baseline FPG, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting C-peptide level and time to achieve glycemic target, and negatively correlated with BMI (all P<0.05). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that BMI (β=1.796, P<0.01), WC (β=0.709, P<0.01), baseline FPG (β=1.459, P<0.01) and HbA1c (β=0.930, P=0.021) were independently related to TDD. Gender (β=-0.107, P=0.003), WC (β=0.005, P=0.029), baseline FPG (β=0.025, P<0.01) and HbA1c (β=0.016, P=0.007) were independently associated with TDD kg-1. Gender (β=-0.015, P=0.048) and disease duration (β=0.134, P=0.029) were independently associated with %TBa. %TBa is around 40% in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with CSII when glycemic control is achieved. In addition to body weight or BMI, WC and glucose levels before CSII should be considered to set TDD. Patients with central obesity or poor glycemic control might need more TDD. Higher %TBa should be considered in female patients or patients with longer disease duration. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion; insulin requirement profiles; type 2 diabetes","Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; C-Peptide; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Infusions, Subcutaneous; Insulin; Insulin Infusion Systems; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; antidiabetic agent; C peptide; glycosylated hemoglobin; insulin; adult; aged; body mass; female; glucose blood level; human; insulin infusion; male; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; subcutaneous drug administration; treatment outcome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067675491"

To support developers in this activity and reduce testing effort, several automated unit test generation tools have been proposed. Most of these approaches have the main goal of covering as more branches as possible. While these approaches have good performance, little is still known on the maintainability of the test code they produce, i.e.,whether the generated tests have a good code quality and if they do not possibly introduce issues threatening their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper we study to what extent existing automated test case generation tools produce potentially problematic test code. We consider seven test smells, i.e.,suboptimal design choices applied by programmers during the development of test cases, as measure of code quality of the generated tests, and evaluate their diffuseness in the unit test classes automatically generated by three state-of-the-art tools such as RANDOOP, JTEXPERT, and EVOSUITE. Moreover, we investigate whether there are characteristics of test and production code influencing the generation of smelly tests. Our study shows that all the considered tools tend to generate a high quantity of two specific test smell types, i.e.,Assertion Roulette and Eager Test, which are those that previous studies showed to negatively impact the reliability of production code. We also discover that test size is correlated with the generation of smelly tests. Based on our findings, we argue that more effective automated generation algorithms that explicitly take into account test code quality should be further investigated and devised. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Empirical studies; Software quality; Test case generation; Test smells","Automation; Codes (symbols); Computer programming; Computer software selection and evaluation; Odors; Software reliability; Software testing; Automated generation; Automated test case generation; Automatically generated; Empirical studies; Software engineering practices; Software Quality; Source code qualities; Test case generation; Automatic test pattern generation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069618644"

Traffic demand shows variability and complexity under comprehensive land-use patterns. Accurate analysis of traffic demand in urban transportation is the key to active traffic control and road guidance. Researchers have widely studied the relationship between traffic demand and land-use patterns, while land-use intensity is ignored when classifying land-use patterns, and the traffic demand distribution in each land-use pattern is not studied specifically. Taxi is a flexible public mode in urban areas, and taxi demand is an important component in analyzing traffic demand and identifying traffic hot-spots in cities. This paper explores taxi demand distribution of comprehensive land-use patterns using online car-hailing data and points of interest (POI) in Chengdu, China. The demand-driven traffic analysis zones are developed by clustering origin– destination points of online car-hailing services. Using POI data, comprehensive land-use patterns are classified with land-use forms and land-use intensity. The K-shape algorithm is adopted to extract the typical taxi demand distribution in each comprehensive land-use pattern. Finally, two indicators, total taxi demand (TTD) and taxi demand difference (TDD), are computed and further analyzed. Results show that taxi demand distribution is still differential even under the same land-use pattern. Three land-use patterns whose average hourly taxi demand reaches about 300 vehicles per square kilometer have the largest TTD and most uneven TDD. The findings can support traffic management, land-use combination, and land-use adjustment to avoid concentrated taxi demand and mismatched TDD. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.","","Motor transportation; Taxicabs; Traffic control; Urban transportation; Accurate analysis; Chengdu; Comprehensive land use; Demand distribution; Demand-driven; Hotspots; Land use pattern; Traffic analysis zones; Traffic demands; Urban areas; Land use","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120081387"

Commonly, developers use automated unit test generators to speed up software testing. The purpose of such tools is to shorten production time without decreasing code quality. Nonetheless, unit tests usually do not have a quality check layer above testing code, which might be hard to guarantee the quality of the generated tests. A strategy to verify the tests quality is to analyze the presence of test smells in test code. Test smells are characteristics in the test code that possibly indicate weaknesses in test design and implementation. Their presence could be used as a quality indicator. In this paper, we present an empirical study to analyze the quality of unit test code generated by automated test tools. We compare the tests generated by two tools (Randoop and Evo-Suite) with the existing unit test suite of twenty-one open-source Java projects. We analyze the unit test code to detect the presence of nineteen types of test smells.

Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications. The proposed software was evaluated by an otolaryngologist and found to be very beneficial in assisting a clinician to reach a hearing impairment diagnosis conclusion more methodically, swiftly and accurately.  © 2020 IEEE.","application framework; audiometry; hearing loss; model-view-viewmodel; software architecture; software design; software implementation","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Computer software reusability; Cost reduction; Graphical user interfaces; Open source software; Open systems; Application frameworks; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Hearing impairments; Maintenance overhead; MVVM patterns; Open source application; Open-source code; Reusable components; Audition","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097539796"

The full width at half maximum values of (0002) and (101¯2) X-ray diffraction rocking curves of the ELOG AlN layer on the nano-net-patterned AlN template are 76 and 306 arcsec, and the values of that on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template are 114 and 357 arcsec, respectively. Nevertheless, the threshold power density (Pth) of the 272-nm lasing from the multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template is 11% lower than that on the nano-net-patterned AlN template. The reason is that the continuous low threading dislocation density (TDD) MQWs zones above the ELOG coalescent areas upon trenched patterns are in parallel with the stimulated light emission direction. When light resonates through the continuous low TDD MQWs zones, it has higher optical gain and less non-radiative recombination than the case on the nano-net-patterned AlN template where the low TDD MQWs zones are discontinuous on the light path. The results indicate that not only the crystal quality but also the TDD distribution originated from the ELOG on the patterned templates have crucial influence on the Pth, and trench-patterned template can improve the performance of waveguide LDs with Fabry-Perot cavities. © 2018","AlGaN; AlN; Deep ultraviolet; Laser diode; Multiple quantum wells","Aluminum gallium nitride; Aluminum nitride; Crystals; Fabry-Perot interferometers; III-V semiconductors; Optical pumping; Quantum well lasers; Sapphire; Semiconductor lasers; Superconducting films; Ultraviolet lasers; AlGaN; Deep ultraviolet; Deep ultraviolet lasers; Fabry-Perot cavity; Non-radiative recombinations; Sapphire substrates; Threading dislocation densities; Threshold power density; Semiconductor quantum wells","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056196694"

By modifying the joint detailing pattern, performance of the connection under lateral loading can be improved to a great extent. For this purpose, novel ductile detailing with additional shear reinforcement in the joint core region has been proposed. This paper analyses some experimental results, relevant to three sub-assemblies' units tested under static lateral reverse cyclic loading, to evaluate the effect of the proposed joint detailing on the behavior of shear wall to floor slab joint region. Successively, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of the wall-slab joint sub-assembly were developed and analyzed using ABAQUS/CAE software. The provision of reinforcement in the core region of wall-slab joint for the construction of shear wall structures has been proven to be effective from the measured and computed results under cyclic loading.

The process of finding information can be done by a method of grouping data into several groups from a data set that is in data mining called the clustering method. Data mining is defined as a method of finding information that is hidden in a database that is large and difficult to obtain by using only ordinary queries. Unit Implementation and Testing, software design is a series of programs or program units. Then unit testing involves verifying that each program unit meets its specifications (Sommerville, 2003). Programs should be released after they are developed, tested to correct errors found in their quality guarantee testing (Padmini, 2005). There are two testing methods, namely: (1) The white box method is a test that focuses on the internal logic of the software (program source code); (2) The black box method is to provide actual results in accordance with the results needed. In the testing phase, the author conducted a black box method that tests the functionality of the software alone without having to know the internal structure of the program (source code). © 2019 International Journal Of Scientific and Technology Research.

In this paper, we provide a performance assessment for the co-existence of a macro (eMBB) and a local factory (URLLC) network and evaluate the network conditions under which the latency and reliability requirements of factory automation applications are met. In particular, we evaluate the co-existence of the eMBB and URLLC networks under two scenarios: (i) synchronized TDD, in which both networks follow the same TDD pattern, and (ii) unsynchronized TDD, in which the eMBB and URLLC networks follow different TDD patterns. Simulation results show that the high downlink interference from the macro base stations towards the factory results in a reduction of the downlink URLLC capacity and service availability in case of synchronized TDD and a reduction of the uplink URLLC capacity and service availability in case of unsynchronized TDD. Finally, it is shown that a promising case for co-existence is the adjacent channel allocation, for both synchronized and unsynchronized TDD deployments. Here, the required isolation to protect the URLLC network in the worst-case scenario where the factory is located next to a macro site can be handled via the factory wall penetration loss (e.g., considering high concrete or metal-coated building walls) along with other solutions such as filters, larger separation distance, and band pairing. © 2019 IEEE.","5G; Coexistence; EMBB; Factory automation; Unsynchronized TDD; URLLC","Factory automation; Metal coatings; Real time control; Synchronization; Walls (structural partitions); Automation applications; Coexistence; EMBB; Next-generation wireless network; Reliability requirements; Reliable communication; Unsynchronized TDD; URLLC; Macros","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075242904"

We present in this paper a methodology supported by the Asm2C++ tool, which allows the users to generate C++ code from abstract state machine models. Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. Abstract test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. To guarantee the correctness of the transformation process, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests. The process has been used to validate our model-to-code transformations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","abstract state machine; automatic code generation; C++; model-driven engineering; transformation validation; unit tests generation","Automatic programming; Automatic test pattern generation; C++ (programming language); Cesium; Cosine transforms; Semantics; Specifications; Systems analysis; Abstract state machines; Automatic code generations; Model-driven Engineering; transformation validation; Unit tests; Model checking","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075467384"

Many software systems release new versions in short iterations. Code changes within such versions may be enhancements, bug fixes, or new features. While preserving some of those changes, the functionality of software may accidentally degrade its performance within a new version when compared to a previous version thus introducing performance regressions. Developers suffer from finding code changes that cause performance regressions especially with a large number of code changes. The cost of detecting performance regressions increases massively as the size of the changes increases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatically identifying potential code changes that cause performance regression from one system version to a subsequent one using source code analysis techniques. Such approach is realized through a prototype tool called PerfDetect. PerfDetect retrieves the changed source code across new and previous version of a specific application's source code. PerfDetect automatically: (a) identifies relevant unit test cases for the changed source code within the new version, (b) compares the execution time of these relevant test cases across the new and previous system versions using various loads to detect performance regressions, and (c) analyzes the root causes for such performance regression within the corresponding source code. In case no relevant unit tests are found as per step (a), automatically generated unit tests for the changed code are used instead within step (a). The proposed approach is evaluated on four open-source applications to assess its ability to detect performance regressions and identify their root causes. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically detect the root cause of performance regression in a shorter time as compared to alternative performance detection approaches. Furthermore, PerfDetect detects performance regressions, that were missed by other performance regression techniques, due to its reliance on source code analysis techniques. © 2020","Performance aware unit test; Performance regression; Source code analysis; Version control system","Automatic test pattern generation; Open source software; Automatically generated; Open source application; Performance regression; Regression techniques; Software performance; Source code analysis; Unit tests; Version control system; C (programming language)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079888500"

However, the important technique of code testing of implementations like unit testing has not generated much research interested so far. As a possible solution, in previous work we have explored the conceptual use of property-based testing. In this code testing method, model specifications and invariants are expressed directly in code and tested through automated and randomised test data generation. This paper expands on our previous work and explores how to use property-based testing on a technical level to encode and test specifications of ABS. As use case the simple agent-based SIR model is used, where it is shown how to test agent behaviour, transition probabilities and model invariants. The outcome are specifications expressed directly in code, which relate whole classes of random input to expected classes of output. During test execution, random test data is generated automatically, potentially covering the equivalent of thousands of unit tests, run within seconds on modern hardware. This makes property-based testing in the context of ABS strictly more powerful than unit testing, as it is a much more natural fit due to its stochastic nature. © 2020, The Author(s).","Agent-based simulation testing; Code testing; Model specification; Test driven development","Codes (symbols); Specifications; Stochastic systems; Agent based simulation; Model specifications; Property based testing; Specification testing; Stochastic nature; Test data generation; Test specifications; Transition probabilities; Automatic test pattern generation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086633506"

The authors’ two previously proposed ideas, namely, Load-Based Power Saving (LBPS) and Virtual Time, are adopted in the design, and two strategies, namely, top-down and bottom-up each with three LBPS schemes are proposed. In the top-down strategy, the load as well as the channel quality on the backhaul link is first considered to determine the sleep pattern for all relay nodes, and then the sleep schedule for UEs under each relay node is determined accordingly. On the contrary, the load and the channel quality on the access links are first considered and then integrated into the sleep schedule on the backhaul link. Two associated mechanisms for the proposed LBPS schemes to operate in the virtual time domain are also proposed in the paper, i.e., calculation of the virtual subframe capacity and the mapping mechanisms from the virtual time to the actual time. The benefit of the proposed schemes in power saving over the standard-based scheme is demonstrated by the simulation study, and the bottom-up scheme of BU-Split outperforms the other schemes under equally distributed input load as well as the hotspot scenario. Discussion on the tradeoff of the processing overhead and the performance for the proposed schemes is presented in the paper. © 2019, The Author(s).","LTE-A; Power saving; Relay node; TDD","Energy conservation; Mobile telecommunication systems; Scheduling; Time domain analysis; Associated mechanism; LTE-A; Mapping mechanism; Power savings; Processing overhead; Relay node; Simulation studies; Sleep scheduling schemes; Sleep research","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071977178"

This has greatly impeded the application of dynamic analysis tools to firmware analysis. The state-of-the-art work automatically models unknown peripherals by observing their access patterns, and then leverages heuristics to calculate the appropriate responses when unknown peripheral registers are accessed. However, we empirically found that this approach and the corresponding heuristics are frequently insufficient to emulate firmware. In this work, we propose a new approach called µEmu to emulate firmware with unknown peripherals. Unlike existing work that attempts to build a general model for each peripheral, our approach learns how to correctly emulate firmware execution at individual peripheral access points. It takes the image as input and symbolically executes it by representing unknown peripheral registers as symbols. During symbolic execution, it infers the rules to respond to unknown peripheral accesses. These rules are stored in a knowledge base, which is referred to during the dynamic firmware analysis. µEmu achieved a passing rate of 95% in a set of unit tests for peripheral drivers without any manual assistance. We also evaluated µEmu with real-world firmware samples and new bugs were discovered. © 2021 by The USENIX Association.

The spatio-temporal characteristics of dryness/wetness for TRHR, as well as the reference evapotranspiration (ETr), precipitation (Pre), and drought risk, were all investigated for the period of 1961–2015. Using the methods of FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO-56), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the Manner–Kendall (M–K) test, Pettitt test, factor contribution rate, and correlation analysis, the variation in the patterns of dryness/wetness, ETr, and Pre, and the causes behind dryness/wetness were discussed. Results indicated that the TRHR underwent a wetting tendency, which was characterized by decreasing ETr and increasing Pre based on the SPEI-12M during 1961–2015. Moreover, 1971–1980 was the driest period, while 2001–2015 was the wettest period. A significant difference between seasons was detected in the dryness/wetness patterns during all study periods, as well as in extreme droughts. The TRHR underwent an overall wetting trend with 85% of the stations' SPEI-3M showing increased variation during spring, in contrast with the north–south distribution pattern of the dryness/wetness with variation in the SPEI during summer. Moreover, it can be seen that droughts with higher longest drought duration (LDD) and total drought duration (TDD) were mostly located on the edge of the eastern and northern TRHR. The influencing factors demonstrate the vital roles of Pre and ETr in generating variation in the dryness/wetness patterns of the southern and northern parts of the TRHR, respectively.

Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit tests, perform static code analysis, or inspect run-time memory use are crucial in the software development life cycle. More sophisticated methods allow for performing meta-analyses of large software repositories, e.g., to discover abstract topics they relate to or common design patterns applied by their developers. They may be useful in gaining a better understanding of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as detecting plagiarism in programming classes. A meaningful measure of similarity of computer programs often forms the basis of such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments for similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable for analysing R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather simple techniques and heuristics and fail to provide a user with the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for working with R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR package. It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but also for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked by applying some obfuscation techniques or imputing dead code.

Estimates suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US 750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost. This paper, the last one in a series of three papers, presents the class inheritance architecture of an open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications.

By exploiting the abundant legitimate channel realizations generated by the radio frequency (RF) mirrors, secure mappings between the original information bits and the transmit patterns are designed, where the transmit patterns include the transmit antenna activation pattern (AAP), mirror activation pattern (MAP) and symbol modulation pattern. The secure mappings used by the transmitter change for each transmission and are unavailable at the eavesdropper due to the independent fading of the legitimate link and the eavesdropping link. Based on the secure mappings, the proposed SQCM conveys the source information bits securely through the complex modulation symbol and instantaneous channel realizations by using a single RF chain. The ergodic secrecy rate is analyzed and a closed-form approximation is derived. Simulation results show that the closed-form approximation coincides with the experimental ergodic secrecy rate, and the achievable ergodic secrecy rate is not influenced by the number of eavesdropping antennas or the channel advantage of the eavesdropping link. Compared to the secure MBM scheme using the traditional artificial noise (AN) technique, the proposed SQCM scheme shows significant performance gain without consuming jamming power when the eavesdropper has more antennas than the legitimate receiver. Compared to the precoded MBM and probabilistic optimized MBM schemes exploiting the eavesdropper's CSI, the proposed SQCM scheme has better secrecy performance in all SNR region and medium-to-high SNR regions respectively without requiring the eavesdropper's CSI. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Media-based modulation; Physical-layer security; Quadrature channel modulation; Secrecy rate","Antennas; Fading (radio); Hole mobility; Mapping; MIMO systems; Mirrors; Modulation; Network layers; Security systems; Activation patterns; Channel realizations; Closed form approximations; Modulation patterns; Multi input multi output; Physical layer security; Quadrature channel; Time division duplex; Signal to noise ratio","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073870098"

This leaves the testing process error prone and time consuming. For satisfied end users with bug-free software delivered on time, there is a need to automate the test oracle process for natural language or informal requirements. The automation of the test oracle is relatively easier with formal requirements, but this task is difficult to achieve with natural language requirements. This study proposes an approach called Restricted Natural Language Agile Requirements Testing (ReNaLART) to automate the test oracle from restricted natural language agile requirements. For this purpose, it uses an existing user story template with some modifications for writing user stories. This helps in identifying test input and expected output for a user story. For comparison of expected and observed outputs it makes use of a regex pattern and string distance functions. It is capable of assigning different types of verdicts automatically depending upon the similarity/dissimilarity between observed and expected outputs of user stories. ReNaLART is validated using several case studies of different domains, namely, OLX Pakistan, Mental Health Tests, McDelivery Pakistan, BlueStacks, Power Searching with Google, TensorFlow Playground, w3Schools 2018 offline and Touch'D. It revealed several faults in five of the above listed eight applications. Plus, the proposed test oracle on an average took 0.02 s for test data generation, expected output generation and verdict assignment. Both these facts show the fault revealing effectiveness and efficiency of ReNaLART. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","agile requirements; automated test oracle; automated test-driven development; behaviour-driven development; restricted natural language","Natural language processing systems; Testing; Agile requirements; Different domains; Distance functions; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Informal requirements; Natural language requirements; Software requirements; Test data generation; Software testing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088308770"

It is difficult to obtain debugging information from the HiL test because the simulator runs a black-box test automatically, depending on the scenario in the test script. At this time, debugging information can be obtained in HiL tests, using memory-updated information, without the source code or the debugging tool. However, this method does not know when the fault occurred, and it is difficult to select the starting point of debugging if the execution flow of the software is not known. In this paper, we propose a fault-localization method using a pattern in which each memory address is updated in the HiL test. Via a sequential pattern-mining algorithm in the memory-updated information of the transferred unit tests, memory-updated patterns are extracted, and the system learns using a convolutional neural network. Applying the learned pattern in the memory-updated information of the integration test can determine the fault point from the normal pattern. The point of departure from the normal pattern is highlighted as a fault-occurrence time, and updated addresses are presented as fault candidates. We applied the proposed method to an HiL test of an OSEK/VDX-based electronic control unit. Through fault-injection testing, we could find the cause of faults by checking the average memory address of 3.28%, and we could present the point of fault occurrence with an average accuracy of 80%. © 2019 by the authors.","Automotive software; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Fault localization; Hardware-in-the-loop (HiL); Sequential pattern mining","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068888919"

This task might seem simple for unit tests thanks to two fundamental unit testing guidelines: isolation (unit tests should exercise only a single unit) and separation (they should be placed next to this unit). However, practice shows that recovery may be challenging because the guidelines typically cannot be fully followed. Furthermore, previous works have already demonstrated that fully automatic test-to-code traceability recovery for unit tests is virtually impossible in a general case. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for this task, which is based on computing traceability links using static and dynamic approaches, comparing their results and presenting the discrepancies to the user, who will determine the final traceability links based on the differences and contextual information. We define a set of discrepancy patterns, which can help the user in this task. Additional outcomes of analyzing the discrepancies are structural unit testing issues and related refactoring suggestions. For the static test-to-code traceability, we rely on the physical code structure, while for the dynamic, we use code coverage information. In both cases, we compute combined test and code clusters which represent sets of mutually traceable elements. We also present an empirical study of the method involving 8 non-trivial open source Java systems. © 2018, The Author(s).","Code coverage; Refactoring; Structural test smells; Test-to-code traceability; Traceability link recovery; Unit testing","Codes (symbols); Open source software; Recovery; Software testing; Code coverage; Refactorings; Structural tests; Traceability links; Unit testing; Open systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058641652"

Estimates suggest that by 2050, over 900 million people worldwide will have disabling hearing loss. The annual global cost of unaddressed hearing loss amounts to US 750 billion. Early detection of hearing loss can reduce its impact on an individual's life in addition to saving a huge cost. This paper, the second in a series of three papers, presents the type dependency architecture of an open-source application framework for hearing impairment diagnosis. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern which separates the development of graphical user interface (GUI) from the development of business and back-end logic. Some of the benefits of the MVVM pattern include reusable components, independent development of GUI and business or back-end logic, flexibility to modify GUI without having to change business or back-end logic, ease of unit testing, and reduced maintenance overhead. The proposed framework along with the open-source code makes it possible to easily extend the application functionality thus enabling other researchers and practitioners to develop their own versions of hearing loss diagnosis applications.

Their negative impact on test effectiveness, understanding, and maintenance has been demonstrated by several empirical studies. However, the scope of these studies has been limited mostly to Java in combination with the JUnit testing framework. Results for other language and framework combinations are - despite their prevalence in practice - few and far between, which might skew our understanding of test smells. The combination of Scala and ScalaTest, for instance, offers more comprehensive means for defining and reusing test fixtures, thereby possibly reducing the diffusion and perception of fixture-related test smells. This paper therefore reports on two empirical studies conducted for this combination. In the first study, we analyse the tests of 164 open-source Scala projects hosted on GitHub for the diffusion of test smells. This required the transposition of their original definition to this new context, and the implementation of a tool (SOCRATES) for their automated detection. In the second study, we assess the perception and the ability of 14 Scala developers to identify test smells. For this context, our results show (i) that test smells have a low diffusion across test classes, (ii) that the most frequently occurring test smells are LazyTest, EagerTest, and AssertionRoulette, and (iii) that many developers were able to perceive but not to identify the smells. © 2019 IEEE.","Scala Language; Test Quality; Test Smells","Diffusion; Fixtures (tooling); Open source software; Automated detection; Empirical studies; Open sources; Scala languages; Test effectiveness; Test fixture; Test quality; Testing framework; Odors","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069608480"

Many centers screen blood products for anti-A and/or anti-B titers to help prevent hemolysis from ABO-incompatible transfusions, yet titer methods and definition of high titers are not standardized. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This international multicenter study collected data on anti-A and anti-B titer practices for plasma, apheresis platelet (AP), and WB units from January 2015 through December 2017 to determine the prevalence of high-titer units using local definitions. RESULTS: A total of 87,701 plasma, AP and WB units were screened for high-titer anti-A and/or anti-B. High-titer detection rates for group A plasma ranged 0%–13.6%; group A AP 2.7%–9.3%; group O AP 2.3%–65.7%; and group O WB 6.4%–20.7%. At the one center that collected group B AP, the high-titer rate was 10.9%. High-titer rates varied from month to month, as well as between years for a given month. There was no clear pattern of when high-titer units were donated. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of high-titer plasma, AP, and WB units varies by titer method and local definition of high titer. Even at the lowest titer threshold of 50, a significant proportion of units had a high-titer antibody, although the clinical relevance of this finding needs further investigation. © 2018 AABB","","blood group A antibody; blood group B antibody; sodium chloride; anti human globulin titer testing; antibody titer; Article; automation; blood; blood group A; blood group B; blood group O; Brazil; controlled study; human; immediate spin manual tube method; immediate spin tube method; immunological procedures; multicenter study; plasma; prevalence; room temperature; seasonal variation; single plasma dilution; thrombocytopheresis; United States","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058217911"

Here we present a modern data analysis interface dedicated for QENS data analysis implemented within the open source software Mantid. The interface has been implemented using the state-of-the-art design pattern Model-View-Presenter (MVP). The MVP, an architectural software design pattern, facilitates automated unit tests as well as decoupling of the business logic, presentation logic and the graphical interface. Several models are implemented for analysing both elastic and quasi-elastic parts of the dynamical scattering function S(Q, ω) and intermediate scattering function I(Q, t). To understand the nature of dynamics in a QENS experiments, several models are also implemented for elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF) and jump diffusions.

We first introduce a pattern-coupled hierarchical Gaussian prior to characterize the sparse channel dependency among neighboring antennas, where the dependency coefficient is modeled by birth- death process. Then, to derive hyperparameters, which are employed to control the sparsity of channel coefficients, we exploit an expectation-maximization (EM) formulation to iteratively maximize a lower bound on the posterior probability. In the M-step, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to maximize the lower bound efficiently. Finally, we develop a belief propagation (BP)-based pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning (PC-SBL) algorithm, referred to as the BP-PC-SBL, to recover block-sparse uplink channels. Based on the factor graph of blocksparse uplink channels, we show that messages in BP satisfy complex Gaussian probability distribution. Therefore, we only need to update their means and variances when updating the messages. BP-PC-SBL algorithm provides precise approximations of matrix inversion as computed by the conventional SBL algorithm, which results in significantly improved computational efficiency.

Despite several advances made over the years, search-based unit test generation still suffers from a lack of guidance due to the limited amount of information available in the source code that, for instance, hampers the generation of complex objects. Previous studies introduced many strategies to address this issue, e.g., dynamic symbolic execution or seeding, but do not take the internal execution of the methods into account. In this paper, we introduce a novel secondary objective called commonality score, measuring how close the execution path of a test case is from reproducing a common or uncommon execution pattern observed during the operation of the software. To assess the commonality score, we implemented it in EvoSuite and evaluated its application on 150 classes from JabRef, an open-source software for managing bibliography references. Our results are mixed. Our approach leads to test cases that indeed follow common or uncommon execution patterns. However, if the commonality score can have a positive impact on the structural coverage and mutation score of the generated test suites, it can also be detrimental in some cases. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated unit testing; Common paths coverage; Search-based software testing; Secondary objective","Application programs; Open source software; Open systems; Amount of information; Branch coverage; Complex objects; Dynamic symbolic executions; Execution paths; ITS applications; Test generations; Unit test generations; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092894407"

However, the degradation of beamforming performance due to outdated Channel State Information at the Transmitter side (CSIT) induced by mobility of users, both in Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) modes, has been a severe problem awaiting to be solved. Many channel prediction schemes have been proposed to address this problem. Most of them focus on the prediction of future CSI on pilot symbols, then reconstruct the non-pilot symbols through conventional interpolation methods. However, the CSI cannot be simply reconstructed through interpolation in high mobility scenario because of the limitation of even pilot design - the phenomenon is named as 'Doppler aliasing' in this paper. To address this, we propose a novel uneven pilot pattern that can provide more Doppler spectrum resolution compared with even pilot which is currently used in most of communication systems. Based on the novel pilot setting, we then propose a channel prediction scheme based on the compressive sensing technique. Numerical results show our scheme can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms, including deep neural networks and autoregression models, for about 15 percents in terms of average throughput in simulated channel generated by the COST2100 channel model.  © 2021 IEEE.","","Channel state information; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Frequency division multiplexing; Interpolation; MIMO systems; Regression analysis; Spectrum efficiency; Time division multiplexing; Channel prediction; Compressive sensing; Multiple inputs; Multiple outputs; Multiple-Input Multiple- Output systems; Performance; Pilot design; Pilot symbols; Prediction schemes; Spectral efficiencies; Compressed sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123357894"

Automatic grading systems are useful for ensuring equity of grading of student submissions to assignments and providing timely feedback on the work. Many of these systems test submissions to assignments based on test cases and the outputs that they achieve, while others use unit tests to check the submissions. The approach presented in this paper checks submissions based on test cases but also analyses what the students actually wrote in their code. Assignment questions are constructed based around the concepts that the student are currently learning in lectures, and the patterns searched for in their submissions are based on these concepts. In this paper we show how to implement this approach effectively. We analyse the use of an automatic grading system within first year Computer Science programming modules and show that the system is straightforward to use and suited for novice programmers, while providing automatic grading and feedback. Evaluation received from students, demonstrators and lecturers show the system is extremely beneficial. The evaluation shows that such systems allow demonstrators more time to assist students during labs. Lecturers can also provide instant feedback to students while keeping track of their progress and identifying where the gaps in students' knowledge are.  © 2021 Owner/Author.","Automated Assessment; Coding; Computer Science Education; CS1","Computer systems programming; Grading; Automated feedback; Automatic grading; Feedback to students; First year; Grading system; Novice programmer; Timely feedback; Unit tests; Students","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099470971"

To acquire the channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), we resort to a mixture of channel sounding and limited feedback, where the former is employed to obtain the CSIT of the antenna connected to the transmit RF chain and the latter is employed for the other antenna. We propose a deep learning method to design the codebook for limited feedback. The learned codebook is distinguished from the traditional ones in two ways. First, the learned codebook is so-called personalized, which is not fixed but adapt to the partially known CSIT. Second, the codebook exhibits different beam patterns from the traditional codebook that is designed for quantization error minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned codebook can achieve higher data rate with lower complexity than traditional codebook.  © 2020 IEEE.","Codebook design; deep learning; non-antenna switching system","Antennas; Deep learning; Directional patterns (antenna); Learning systems; Switching systems; Time division multiplexing; Antenna switching; Channel sounding; Learning methods; Limited feedback; Lower complexity; Quantization errors; Radio frequency chains; Time division duplex; Channel state information","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100266523"

It notably improves the network resource utilization with sporadic directional packet arrivals. Although, the feasibility of the ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) within such deployments is critically challenged, mainly due to the crosslink interference (CLI). In this work, we propose a semistatic and computationally-efficient TDD radio frame adaptation algorithm for 5G macro deployments. Particularly, we first identify the quasi-static variance of the cross-cell traffic buffering performance, with various CLI co-existence conditions. Accordingly, a common radio frame pattern is dynamically estimated based on the filtered multi-cell traffic statistics. Our system-level simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves a highly improved URLLC outage performance, i.e., offering 40% reduction gain of the achievable URLLC outage latency compared to perfect static-TDD, and approaching the optimal interference-free flexible-TDD case; though, with a significantly lower control overhead size. © 2020 IEEE.","5G new radio; Cross link interference (CLI); Dynamic TDD; Traffic; URLLC","Time division multiplexing; Traffic surveys; Adaptation algorithms; Computationally efficient; Control overhead; Interference-free; Low-latency communication; Network resource utilization; Outage performance; System level simulation; 5G mobile communication systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087272311"

Its goal is to help readers learn software design by discovering the experience of the design process. To this end, a narrative is used that introduces each element of design know-how in context, and explores alternative solutions in that context. The narrative is supported by hundreds of code fragments and design diagrams. The first chapter is a general introduction to software design. The subsequent chapters cover design concepts and techniques, which are presented as a continuous narrative anchored in specific design problems. The design concepts and techniques covered include effective use of types and interfaces, encapsulation, composition, inheritance, design patterns, unit testing, and many more. A major emphasis is placed on coding and experimentation as a necessary complement to reading the text. To support this aspect of the learning process, a companion website with practice problems is provided, and three sample applications that capture numerous design decisions are included. Guidance on these sample applications is provided in a section called “Code Exploration” at the end of each chapter. Although the Java language is used as a means of conveying design-related ideas, the book’s main goal is to address concepts and techniques that are applicable in a host of technologies. This book is intended for readers who have a minimum of programming experience and want to move from writing small programs and scripts to tackling the development of larger systems. This audience naturally includes students in university-level computer science and software engineering programs. As the prerequisites to specific computing concepts are kept to a minimum, the content is also accessible to programmers without a primary training in computing. In a similar vein, understanding the code fragments requires only a minimal grasp of the language, such as would be taught in an introductory programming course. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Java; Software Architecture; Software Development; Software Engineering; Software Testing","","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148840639"

Often a considerable time is dedicated by human programmers to designing effective test cases. This paper proposes an approach for automatically generating test cases tailored to the characteristics of the code under test. For this, the classes of a software system to be tested are characterised by a static code analysis aiming at summarising and representing their behaviour. As test cases check the behaviour of code, classes that exhibit a close behaviour may be checked using similar test cases. Therefore, in the approach proposed, for classes having a comparable behaviour, test cases are generated by taking as a template the test cases available for one of the classes among the similar ones. The approach has been assessed on a few open source projects and has proved to be viable for generating applicable and effective test cases for the classes. © 2020 IEEE.","static code analysis; test case generation; test templating; verification","Automatic programming; Open source software; Software testing; Automatic Generation; Human programmers; Large amounts; Open source projects; Software systems; Static code analysis; Test case; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100822248"

Along with the continuous development of the IoT platform, there are obstacles in the number of nodes that continue to increase. In addition, there are growing issues of availability, scalability, and functionality of applications that will lead to dead code. Micro-services architectural pattern emerges as an alternative. However, the service decomposition process and data management on services in Micro-service applications require special attention. Based on the issues described above, in this study, the Micro-services architecture paradigm with a domain-driven design (DDD) approach is applied to develop an IoT Monitoring application that can handle various IoT projects on one platform. The results show that a definition of a service is designed to be more accurate. The application of the DDD concept in breaking down application services helps in mapping each domain. Therefore, it can produce adaptive software products and generate easy-to-maintain code. The Micro-service architecture with a REST API-based approach applied to the IoT monitoring application has worked well, tested at the unit testing, integration, and performance stages. Based on performance testing results, the number of nodes (with three sensors per node) that can access simultaneously reaches 75 nodes. The total sensors in one node can have up to 10 sensors per node with a response time of less than 100ms. System development can be done without overhauling the entire system and does not interfere with the performance of other services. © 2021 IEEE.","Domain-Driven Design; Internet of Things; Micro-services; Monitoring","Application programming interfaces (API); Information management; Integration testing; Well testing; Architectural pattern; Continuous development; Decomposition process; Design approaches; Domain-driven designs; Micro services; Monitoring applications; Performance; Service decompositions; Services Architectures; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126516394"

Furthermore, the study described ordering patterns to investigate the benefit of repeated testing. Methods: Test result, requisitioning unit, test date and the patient’s social security number were collected from the Department of Clinical Immunology at Odense University Hospital in 2007-2016 and merged with patient diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry. Results: Overall, 5% were diagnosed with RA. IgM RF remained the preferred test during the entire period. Test sensitivity was 61% for IgM RF and 54% for ACPA. The test specificity was 88% for IgM RF and 96% for ACPA. PPV was higher for ACPA than for IgM RF (30% versus 12%) and NPV was equal (99%) in primary care. Few individuals seroconverted from negative to positive (ACPA 2% and IgM RF 5%) and positive to negative (ACPA 3% and IgM RF 6%). Conclusions: ACPA has a higher PPV for RA than IgM RF, whereas their NPV is identical. ACPA is the better choice when testing for RA in primary care. Seroconversion is rare, and it is only rarely relevant to retest. © 2020, Danish Medical Association.

However, for an effective non-invasive drug administration method like transdermal drug delivery (TDD), drugs have to pass through this integument system. An electrical equivalent circuit can be used to represent the complex structure of skin. This circuit can be used to calculate impedance of the skin, which is a function of frequency. The current work relates to the analysis of the transfer function (TF) of the Montague Model. This model is based on physiological stratification of skin. Sensitivity analysis is performed on this skin impedance model to study the changes in system parameters of the model. During active drug delivery, the impedance of underlying skin has to be continuously monitored within a time frame for any physiological changes. Thus when impedance measurement is calculated from the same patch of skin under different conditions, it will yield different impedance patterns, which reflects the changes in the physiological stratification of the skin. This work will enable us to understand such patterns and correlate the physical significance of the parameters of the Model.

The radiating antenna elements are designed to resonate over two frequency ranges: 1.41 GHz – 2.11 GHz and 3.6 GHz – 3.8 GHz, with (S11/S22) reference considered as-10 dB,covering frequencies allotted for L1 GPS, 2G standards (GSM-1800 and GSM-1900), 3G standard (UMTS), LTE (working on TDD and FDD techniques) and 5G New Radio. The designed antenna is optimized using IE3D simulation software and fabricated on FR4 substrate having relative permittivity of 4.4, loss tangent of 0.02 and thickness of 1.6 mm. A three step isolation improvement and impedance bandwidth enhancement technique is presented to reduce the mutual coupling and cover the desired frequency range. Antenna characteristics in terms of the reflection coefficient, mutual coupling, radiation pattern and gain are measured and show good agreement with the simulated results. Diversity performance is evaluated in terms of the envelop correlation coefficient. It is found to be less than 0.12 and 0.06 in the first and second bands of frequencies, respectively. The planar structure and capability to support several frequencies of multiple generations make the proposed MIMO antenna a good candidate for integration with future wireless devices. © 2020, Paulus Editora.

Besides, these services are shifting from dominant Downlink (DL) Traffic to a more equilibrate DL/UpLink (UL) and dominant UL traffic for specific emerging services. One option to accommodate this new behavior is to use Time Duplex Division (TDD), where the radio frame is shared between UL and DL time slots, namely UL/DL pattern. While 4G TDD has a fixed number of configurations that cannot be updated on runtime, 5GNR allows complete flexibility to define the UL/DL pattern. Therefore, 5G base stations can dynamically change the pattern to adapt to the type of traffic (i.e., UL or DL). However, the 5G standard does not specify algorithms or solutions to derive the UL/DL pattern. To fill this gap, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that adds intelligence to the base station to self-adapt to the traffic pattern of the cell type. The proposed DRL algorithm monitors UL and DL buffers at the 5G base station to derive the optimal UL/DL pattern in respect to the current traffic configuration. The proposed solution delivers the optimal configuration in a timely and efficient manner. Simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to avoid buffer overflow and ensure the generality by reacting to traffic pattern changes. © 2021 IEEE.","","Base stations; Deep learning; Reinforcement learning; Time division multiplexing; Band width; Cell types; Downlink traffics; Fixed numbers; Low latency; Networks services; Runtimes; Self-adapt; Timeslots; Traffic pattern; 5G mobile communication systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127299008"

In this paper, we empirically explore the impact and relationship between refactoring operations and test smells in 250 open-source Android applications (apps). Our experiments showed that the type of refactoring operations performed by developers on test files differ from those performed on non-test files. Further, results around test smells show a co-occurrence between certain smell types and refactorings, and how refactorings are utilized to eliminate smells.

Soil is a huge C reservoir and its storage potential varies greatly with forest types. Therefore, in the present study, the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage pattern was assessed from 70 plots laid at three selected forest types comprising seven study sites at Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India: tropical dry deciduous (TDD I and TDD II), tropical semi-evergreen (TSE I and TSE II) and tropical evergreen forest (TEF I, TEF II and TEF III) at three depths (0–10, 10.1–20 and 20.1–30 cm). Statistical analyses were performed to understand the relationships between SOC stocks with other predictor variables. The SOC stock varied markedly with forest type and site-wise. The SOC ranged from 58 (TEF III) to 123.6 (TDD I) Mg C/ha with a mean of 84.9 ± 4.4 Mg C/ha at 0–30 cm depth. SOC stock decreased, while soil bulk density increased with increase in soil depth. The TDD forest type (115.6 Mg C/ha) stocked the highest SOC compared to TEF (75.1 Mg C/ha) and TSE (68.9 Mg C/ha) forest types. Of the total SOC stock (0–30 cm), 44.2, 32.0 and 23.8% were stored in 0–10, 10.1–20 and 20.1–30 cm respectively in all the forest types. In contrast, litter C stock were high in TEF and TSE forest types and low in TDD forest type. SOC showed significant (P < 0.01) negative relationships with bulk density, litter C, and vegetation attributes. The SOC stock stored in the study sites amount to 212.9 (TEF III) to 453.6 (TDD I) Mg of CO2 equivalents. The present study reveals that forest type and site characteristics have a profound impact on SOC stock, which would, in turn, exert a great bearing on the ecosystem C cycling. These results would also enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forest types in soil C sequestration and for developing and validating SOC models for tropical forest ecosystems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent; Forest types; Protected areas; Soil carbon storage; Tropical forest ecosystems; Western Ghats","Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; India; Soil; India; Kanyakumari; Tamil Nadu; Western Ghats; Animals; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Magnesium; Organic carbon; Soils; Tropics; organic carbon; soil organic carbon; soil organic matter; unclassified drug; carbon; CO2 equivalent; Forest type; Protected areas; Soil carbon storage; Tropical forest; Western ghats; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; forest ecosystem; forest soil; protected area; soil organic matter; statistical analysis; tropical forest; Article; bulk density; carbon sequestration; controlled study; dry weight; forest floor litter; India; plant litter; predictor variable; seasonal variation; soil analysis; statistical analysis; tropical dry deciduous forest; tropical evergreen forest; tropical rain forest; tropical semi evergreen forest; validation study; wildlife; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; chemistry; climate change; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; forest; soil; Forestry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074267875"

Previous studies have investigated the effectiveness of these tools by comparing automatically generated test suites (ATSs) to manually written test suites (MTSs). Most of these studies report that ATSs can achieve higher code coverage, or even mutation coverage, than MTSs, particularly when suites are generated from defective code. However, these studies usually consider a limited amount of classes or subject programs, while the adoption of such tools in the industry is still low. This work aims to compare the effectiveness of ATSs and MTSs when applied as regression test suites. We conduct an empirical study, using ten programs (1368 classes), written in Java, that already have MTSs and apply two sophisticated tools that automatically generate test cases: Randoop and EvoSuite. To evaluate the test suites' effectiveness, we use line and mutation coverage. Our results indicate that MTSs are, in general, more effective than ATSs regarding the investigated metrics. Moreover, the number of generated test cases may not indicate test suites' effectiveness. Furthermore, there are situations when ATSs are more effective, and even when ATSs and MTSs can be complementary. © 2020 ACM.","automatic test generation; empirical studies; mutation testing","Computer software; Automatically generated; Code coverage; Empirical studies; Large amounts; Large-scale studies; Regression tests; Unit test generations; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099399953"

It is a complex feature which should be robustly tested at all stages of development. Unit testing is an effective technique for fine-grained verification of feature behaviors that is not widely-used to test authentication. Part of the problem is that resources to help developers unit test security features are limited. Most security testing guides recommend test cases in a ""black box""or penetration testing perspective. These resources are not easily applicable to developers writing new unit tests, or who want a security-focused perspective on coverage. In this paper, we address these issues by applying a grounded theory-based approach to identify common (unit) test cases for token authentication through analysis of 481 JUnit tests exercising Spring Security-based authentication implementations from 53 open source Java projects. The outcome of this study is a developer-friendly unit testing guide organized as a catalog of 53 test cases for token authentication, representing unique combinations of 17 scenarios, 40 conditions, and 30 expected outcomes learned from the data set in our analysis. We supplement the test guide with common test smells to avoid. To verify the accuracy and usefulness of our testing guide, we sought feedback from selected developers, some of whom authored unit tests in our dataset.  © 2020 ACM.","Authentication; Java; Repository Mining; Security Test; Unit Test","Authentication; Black-box testing; Open source software; Security systems; Springs (components); Black boxes; Fine grained; Grounded theory; Open sources; Penetration testing; Security features; Security testing; Unit testing; Statistical tests","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093653746"

The goal of this study was to better understand treatment patterns (total daily dose [TDD] and concomitant medications), adherence, and persistence in real-world patients treated with U-500R. DESIGN AND METHODS | We selected patients from the Truven Health MarketScan database who initiated U-500R between 2010 and 2013. We collected data for three periods: Pre-index (12 months before initiation), post-index (12 months after initiation or until a gap of $60 days in U-500R claims), and follow-up (12 months after post-index). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a regression model as appropriate. RESULTS | We identified 1,582 patients who met the selection criteria. The median TDD of U-500R during the post-index period was 333 units/day, with 70.0% of patients using 300–400 units/day. During the post-index period, 74.1% of patients had U-500R claims that did not overlap with prescriptions for other insulins, interpreted as U-500R monotherapy. Among patients with $1 U-500R fill in the post-index period (n 5 1,208), 54.4% had a medication possession ratio (MPR, a measure of adherence) $80%. Although 849 patients had a gap of $60 days in U-500R claims in the post-index period, 602 of those resumed U-500R in the follow-up period. Of the 733 patients who had no gap in U-500R claims in the post-index period, 286 had a gap of $60 days in claims in year 2, and 447 continued with U-500R treatment beyond 2 years. CONCLUSION | These results demonstrate that U-500R was commonly used as insulin monotherapy, with a median TDD.300 units/day. Compared with published, relevant studies of other insulins, U-500R showed similar or greater adherence and persistence rates. These new data may help guide clinical decision-making when choosing insulin therapy for patients requiring high doses of insulin. © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.","","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; human insulin; long acting insulin; metformin; pramlintide; short acting insulin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sulfonylurea; u 500r; adult; aged; Article; combination drug therapy; controlled study; drug use; female; follow up; human; insulin treatment; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; middle aged; monotherapy; patient compliance; prescription; priority journal; very elderly; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120436796"

Especially in large-scale formats like MOOCs, this might become a question because to trick current automated assignment assessment systems (APAAS) is astonishingly easy and the question arises whether unattended grading components grade the capability to program or to trick. This study analyzed what kind of tricks students apply beyond the well-known “copy-paste” code plagiarism to derive possible mitigation options. Therefore, this study analyzed student cheat patterns that occurred in two programming courses and developed a unit testing framework JEdUnit as a solution proposal that intentionally targets such tricky educational aspects of programming. The validation phase validated JEdUnit in another programming course. This study identified and analyzed four recurring cheat patterns (overfitting, evasion, redirection, and injection) that hardly occur in “normal” software development and are not aware to normal unit testing frameworks that are frequently used to test the correctness of student submissions. Therefore, the concept of well-known unit testing frameworks was extended by adding three “countermeasures”: randomization, code inspection, separation. The validation showed that JEdUnit detected these patterns and in consequence, reduced cheating entirely to zero.

Previous research has found that concurrency faults are hard to avoid, hard to find, often leading to undesired and unpredictable behavior. Further, with the growing availability of multi-core devices and adaptation of concurrency features in high-level languages, concurrency faults occur reportedly often, which is why countermeasures must be investigated to limit harm. Reactive programming provides an abstraction to simplify complex concurrent and asynchronous tasks through reactive language extensions such as the RxJava and Project Reactor libraries for Java. Still, blocking violations are possibly resulting in concurrency faults with no Java compiler warnings. BlockHound is a tool that detects incorrect blocking by wrapping the original code and intercepting blocking calls to provide appropriate runtime errors. In this study, we seek an understanding of how common blocking violations are and whether a tool such as BlockHound can give us insight into the root-causes to highlight them as pitfalls to developers. The investigated Softwares are Java-based open-source projects using reactive frameworks selected based on high star ratings and large fork quantities that indicate high adoption. We activated BlockHound in the project's test-suites and analyzed log files for common patterns to reveal blocking violations in 7/29 investigated open-source projects with 5024 stars and 1437 forks. A small number of system calls could be identified as root-causes. We here present countermeasures that successfully removed the uncertainty of blocking violations. The code's intentional logic was retained in all validated projects through passing unit-Tests.  © 2020 IEEE.","BlockHound; Blocking-Violations; Concurrency; Reactive-Programming","Codes (symbols); High level languages; Open source software; Open systems; Stars; Intentional logic; Java compilers; Open source projects; Processing units; Reactive languages; Reactive programming; Resource utilizations; Run-time errors; Java programming language","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097654261"

For dynamic time division duplex (TDD) systems, the real-time optimization of the radio pattern selection becomes of a vital significance in achieving decent URLLC outage latency. In this study, a dual reinforcement machine learning (RML) approach is developed for online pattern optimization in 5G new radio TDD deployments. The proposed solution seeks to minimizing the maximum URLLC tail latency, i.e., min-max problem, by introducing nested RML instances. The directional and real-time traffic statistics are monitored and given to the primary RML layer to estimate the sufficient number of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) symbols across the upcoming radio pattern. The secondary RML sub-networks determine the DL and UL symbol structure which best minimizes the URLLC outage latency. The proposed solution is evaluated by extensive and highly-detailed system level simulations, where our results demonstrate a considerable URLLC outage latency improvement with the proposed scheme, compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic-TDD proposals. © 2013 IEEE.","5G new radio; cross link interference (CLI); Dynamic-TDD; machine learning; Q-learning; reinforcement learning; URLLC","E-learning; Real time systems; Reinforcement learning; Time division multiplexing; Traffic surveys; Delay-sensitive applications; Low-latency communication; Pattern optimization; Radio access technologies; Real time traffics; Real-time optimization; Reinforcement learning approach; System level simulation; 5G mobile communication systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089307031"

Alternatively, a mocking framework, such as Mockito, can automatically generate test spies that allow us to record the interactions and express our expectations in a declarative domain-specific language. According to our study of the test code for Scala's Iterator trait, the latter approach can lead to a significant reduction of test code complexity in terms of metrics such as code size (in some cases over 70% smaller), cyclomatic complexity, and amount of additional mutable state required. In this tools paper, we argue that the resulting test code is not only more maintainable, readable, and intentional, but also a better stylistic match for the Scala community than manually implemented, explicitly stateful test spies. © 2019 ACM.","Automated unit testing; Iterator design pattern; Mock-based testing; Prefix sum; Spy-based testing; Stream processing; Test code complexity; Test code metrics","Codes (symbols); Object oriented programming; Problem oriented languages; Automated unit testing; Design Patterns; Prefix sum; Stream processing; Test code; Testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074454692"

Our findings, which largely generalized across the studied IDEs and programming languages Java and C#, question several commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about developer testing: half of the developers in our study do not test; developers rarely run their tests in the IDE; most programming sessions end without any test execution; only once they start testing, do they do it extensively; a quarter of test cases is responsible for three quarters of all test failures; 12 percent of tests show flaky behavior; Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not widely practiced; and software developers only spend a quarter of their time engineering tests, whereas they think they test half of their time.

Massive MIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance the average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time-division duplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) subframe configurations, is a promising enhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic TDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic patterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference among cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique characteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a marriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the limitation of dynamic TDD in macrocell (MC) networks. Specifically, we advocate that the benefits of dynamic TDD can be fully extracted in MC networks equipped with massive MIMO, i.e., the BS-to-BS interference can be effectively removed by increasing the number of BS antennas. We provide detailed analysis using random matrix theory to show that the effect of the BS-to-BS interference on UL transmissions vanishes as the number of BS antennas per user grows infinitely large.

We have recently examined the effects of a moderate maternal exposure to EtOH on crucial brain enzyme activities in offspring rats, and discussed the translational challenges arising when attempting to simulate any of the clinical conditions associated with FASD. Materials and methods: In this current study, we: (i) address the need for a more consistent and reliable in vivo experimental platform that could simulate milder cases of FASD complicated by simultaneous thiamine-deprivation during gestation and (ii) explore the effects of such a moderate maternal exposure pattern to EtOH and a thiamine-deficient diet (TDD) on crucial enzyme activities in the offspring rat brains. Results: We demonstrate a significant decrease in the newborn and 21-day-old offspring body and brain weight due to maternal dietary thiamine-deprivation, as well as evidence of crucial brain enzyme activity alterations that in some cases are present in the offspring rat brains long after birth (and the end of the maternal exposure to both EtOH and TDD). Conclusions: Our findings provide a preliminary characterization of important neurochemical effects due to maternal exposure to EtOH and TDD during gestation that might affect the offspring rat neurodevelopment, and that characterization should be further explored in a brain region-specific manner level as well as through the parallel examination of changes in the offspring rat brain lipid composition. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Acetylcholinesterase (ATPase); ethanol; fetal alcohol syndrome; rat brain; thiamine-deprivation","Animals; Brain; Ethanol; Female; Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats; Thiamine; acetylcholinesterase; adenosine triphosphatase (magnesium); adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); alcohol; alcohol; thiamine; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; body weight; brain weight; controlled study; enzyme activity; female; fetal alcohol syndrome; newborn; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; rat; thiamine deficiency; animal; brain; pregnancy; prenatal exposure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073928544"

The Markovian view of the testing process relates unit quality and test quality to the expected unit/system quality, and to the expected number of tests. The model is based on replicating testing where the test is replicated only after a fail test outcome. A set of equations are generalized for many component systems. The study enables the costs and associated benefits for particular groups of components to be considered for module testing at different levels of system hierarchy. Simulation results show that the selection of an appropriate testing architecture and modular architecture can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of system testing. The model is applied to several testing architectures and test patterns to illustrate the tradeoff comparisons that can be made between different system architectures in terms of the overall test cost and the resulting system quality. Several heuristics are derived to assist in planning tests of complex systems for optimizing quality and cost before systems are built. This Markovian model of testability in systems shows promise for use from the modular unit build-level in engineering manufacture development through to strategizing portfolio-level integration and information assurance testing of new capability projects with legacy systems in a family-of-systems. The early abstract testability work reinforces the benefits of iterating testing as early and often as possible. Following trials to validate the model in different contexts and to refine the interface with systems engineers, this testability model could be added to other design for six-sigma tools and techniques to better enable systems engineering practitioners to tradeoff on testability options well before testing starts. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Latent defect; Markov process; modular testing; probabilistic modeling; residual defect; system architecture; testability; testing architecture","Architecture; Computer architecture; Defects; Legacy systems; Markov processes; Process engineering; Well testing; Latent defects; Modular testing; Probabilistic modeling; Residual defects; System architectures; Testability; Integration testing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075758919"

This study mainly utilizes the Fourier quantile unit root test to survey the convergence of the SO2 emissions per capita in 74 cities of China during the period of December 2014 to June 2019, by conducting five traditional unit root tests and a quantile root unit test as a comparative analysis. The empirical results indicate that the SO2 emissions per capita in 72 out of 74 cities in China are convergent in the sample period. The results also suggest that the unit root behavior of the SO2 emissions per capita in these cities is asymmetrically persistent at different quantiles. For the cities with the convergent SO2 emissions, the government should consider the asymmetric mean-reverting pattern of SO2 emissions when implementing environmental protection policies at different stages.

In path-oriented automated unit testing, the abstract memory model is used to accurately extract the semantics and constraints of variables on the path, which is a prerequisite for automatically generating test cases. However, the existing abstract memory model still has shortcomings, such as incomplete type support, difficulty in handling complex operations accurately. This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of the abstract memory model and the completeness of support. Based on the existing abstract memory model the paper proposes an optimized abstract memory model supporting the expression of numeric, pointer, structure, array, union.

Like production code, unit tests are also affected by bad programming practices which can have a negative impact on the quality and maintenance of a software system. While several studies addressed code and test smells in desktop applications, there is little knowledge of test smells in the context of mobile applications. In this study, we extend the existing catalog of test smells by identifying and defining new smells and survey over 40 developers who confirm that our proposed smells are bad programming practices in test suites. Additionally, we perform an empirical study on the occurrences and distribution of the proposed smells on 656 open-source Android applications (apps). Our findings show a widespread occurrence of test smells in apps. We also show that apps tend to exhibit test smells early in their lifetime with different degrees of co-occurrences on different smell types. This empirical study demonstrates that test smells can be used as an indicator for necessary preventive software maintenance for test suites. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Software maintenance; Software quality; Test smells; Unit test","Android (operating system); Codes (symbols); Computer software maintenance; Odors; Open source software; Android applications; Co-occurrence; Desktop applications; Empirical studies; Exploratory studies; Mobile applications; Programming practices; Software systems; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087418786"

The antenna is designed on FR-4 substrate with dielectric constant 4.4, thickness 1.6 mm and loss tangent 0.02. Ground plane of dimension 80 mm x 55 mm is selected for the final geometry. In order to improve the isolation between the identical antenna elements a T-shaped ground extension is designed. The proposed antenna is designed, simulated and optimized using IE3D simulation software. The five bands in which the antenna elements can resonate ranges from 700 MHz – 750 MHz, 1.47 GHz – 1.9 GHz, 2.04 GHz-2.26 GHz, 2.7 GHz-2.89 GHz, 3.2 GHz – 3.8 GHz and can support GPS, 2G, 3G, LTE TDD/FDD and 5G New Radio applications. Antenna characteristics regarding reflection coefficient, mutual coupling and radiation pattern in azimuth as well as elevation planes are discussed. Diversity performance is measured in terms of envelop correlation coefficient and is below 0.07 over all frequencies under consideration. The planar structure of the designed antenna provides an ease of fabrication. The ability to support multiple frequencies of different mobile communication generations makes the antenna fit to be integrated within future multi-generation compatible wireless devices. © BEIESP.","5G new radio; Isolation improvement; MIMO antenna; Penta-band antenna","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067974652"

However, few tools are publicly available and all of them target JUnit - the most popular testing framework in Java. To overcome these limitations, we propose SoCRATES. This fully automated tool is able to identify six test smells in Scala Test which is the most prevalent testing framework in Scala. An empirical investigation on 164 Scala projects shows that our tool is able to reach a high precision without sacrificing recall.

Novice students may produce code that is close to a correct solution but contains syntactic errors; WebTA attempts to salvage the promising portions of the student's submission and suggest repairs that are more meaningful than typical compiler error messages. Alternatively, a student misunderstanding may result in well-formed code that passes unit tests yet contains clear design flaws; through additional analysis, WebTA can identify and flag them.

However, the maintenance cost of the automatically generated tests presents a significant barrier to adoption of this technology. To address this challenge, we propose a novel technique for automated and fine-grained incremental generation of unit tests through minimal augmentation of an existing test suite. The technique uses iterative, incremental refinement of test-drivers and symbolic execution, guided by a diagnostics engine. The diagnostics engine works off a novel precise and efficient byte-level dynamic dependence analysis built using Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs). We present a tool FSX implementing this technique and evaluate it under two practical use-cases of incremental unit test generation, on five revisions of the open-source software iPerf, as well as on 3 large subjects, comprising more than 60 thousand lines of code, from in-house commercial network products.

The approach encompasses the construction of several models: a feature model, an interface model, a product model, and unit and integration test models. The abstract syntax and consistency rules of these models are specified by means of metamodels written in UML and Alloy and automatically checked with Alloy Analyzer. Using the model finding capabilities of Alloy Analyzer, integration tests can be automatically generated from the remaining models, through the composition and instantiation of unit tests.

Their presence negatively affects the maintainability of a test suite as well as the production code. Despite the many studies that address the negative impacts of various test smells, until now there has been no empirical evidence considering the relation between the evolution of test smells and that of faults in the production code. This paper presents such evidence. It presents a case study of data collected from 28 versions of Apache Ant that include a total of 4,447 unit tests. Three key results arise from the data. First, the absolute number of test smells increases as Apache Ant evolves. Second, some test smells are positively correlated with the existence of faults in the production code. Finally, our results show that it is possible to predict faults in the production code based on the existence of test smells in the code's unit tests. In addition, the resulting prediction model is more accurate at predicting high-severity faults than low-severity faults. This is an important result as it enables an engineer to focus preventative maintenance efforts, applied to the production code, using test smells found in the unit tests. © 2013 IEEE.","exploratory studies; mining software repositories; Test smells; unit testing","Codes (symbols); Forecasting; Odors; Absolute number; Exploratory studies; Fault proneness; Mining software repositories; Prediction model; Preventative maintenance; Unit testing; Unit tests; Software testing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077823272"

From our study, we draw the following conclusions. First, there are 3 factors/models that have a major impact on the performance of UDNs, and they should be considered when performing theoretical analyses: i) a multi-piece path loss model with line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions; ii) a non-zero antenna height difference between base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs); iii) a finite BS/UE density. Second, there are 4 factors/models that have a minor impact on the performance of UDNs, i.e., changing the results quantitatively but not qualitatively, and thus their incorporation into theoretical analyses is less urgent: i) a general multi-path fading model based on Rician fading; ii) a correlated shadow fading model; iii) a BS density dependent transmission power; iv) a deterministic BS/user density. Finally, there are 5 factors/models for future study: i) a BS vertical antenna pattern; ii) multi-antenna and/or multi-BS joint transmissions; iii) a proportional fair BS scheduler; iv) a non-uniform distribution of BSs; v) a dynamic time division duplex (TDD) or full duplex (FD) network. Our conclusions can guide researchers to down-select the assumptions in their theoretical analyses, so as to avoid unnecessarily complicated results, while still capturing the fundamentals of UDNs in a meaningful way. © 2017 IFIP.","","Directional patterns (antenna); Mobile ad hoc networks; Multipath fading; Telecommunication links; Wireless networks; Density dependent; Joint transmissions; Non-uniform distribution; Nonline of sight; Path loss models; Proportional fair; Shadow fading model; Transmission power; Wireless ad hoc networks","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026203247"

To realize an even more cost-effective network, we have studied the accommodation of MFH and secondary services in a single TDM-PON. We focus on the fact that a time division duplex (TDD) scheme will be applied to future radio access (FRA). Since a PON link is a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme, whereas a radio propagation link is a TDD scheme, unallocated intervals occur periodically in the PON link. For the above reason, we have already proposed a technique for estimating unallocated intervals in a TDD-based MFH link that involves prelearning based on a test signal transmission, and the signal of the secondary service is accommodated in the unallocated intervals. However, a scheme for recovering from an error when the estimation is wrong and the test signal is not transmitted has yet to be studied. This paper proposes an estimation technique without a test signal transmission and an estimation-error recovery scheme. The proposed estimator calculates the correlation coefficient between captured uplink traffic and the seven types of uplink and downlink ratio patterns standardized by the third generation partnership project (3GPP: http://www.3gpp.org/). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation technique by using a numerical simulation. The recovery scheme detects the estimation error and re-Allocates the bandwidth. We implement the estimator and the recovery scheme in a 10 Gigabit Ethernet PON (10G-EPON) prototype. We report the feasibility of the proposed scheme along with experimental results. © 2009-2012 OSA.","Bandwidth allocation; Mobile fronthaul (MFH); Passive optical network (PON); Time division duplex (TDD)","Bandwidth; Computer system recovery; Cost effectiveness; Errors; Estimation; Frequency allocation; Passive networks; Passive optical networks; Radio waves; Recovery; Secondary recovery; 10-Gigabit Ethernet; Centralized radio access networks; Correlation coefficient; Cost-effective network; Estimation techniques; Mobile fronthaul; Passive Optical Network (PON); Time division duplex; Time division multiplexing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042673341"

While the concept of quality is multidimensional, most of the effort in testing context hasbeen channelled towards measuring test effectiveness. Objective: While effectiveness of tests is certainly important, we aim to identify a core list of testing principles that also address other quality facets of testing, and to discuss how they can be quantified as indicators of test quality. Method: We have conducted a two-day workshop with our industry partners to come up with a list of relevant principles and best practices expected to result in high quality tests. We then utilised our academic and industrial training materials together with recommendations in practitioner oriented testing books to refine the list. We surveyed existing literature for potential metrics to quantify identified principles. Results: We have identified a list of 15 testing principles to capture the essence of testing goals and best practices from quality perspective. Eight principles do not map toexisting test smells and we propose metrics for six of those. Further, we have identified additional potential metrics for the seven principles that partially map to test smells. Conclusion: We provide a core list of testing principles along with a discussion of possible ways to quantify them for assessing goodness of tests. We believe that our work would be useful for practitioners in assessing the quality of their tests from multiple perspectives including but not limited to maintainability, comprehension and simplicity. © 2017 IEEE.","metrics; test quality; unit testing","Materials testing; Odors; Best practices; High Quality Test; Industrial training; metrics; Production system; Test effectiveness; Test quality; Unit testing; Testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026860594"

The downlink requires ultra-wide bandwidth and hence leads to the usage of millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum with analog beamforming; however, this causes difficulty for the uplink: the efficient multiple access of small-packet users in the same mmWave carrier by time-division duplex (TDD). Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-beam multi-access scheme for the uplink traffic of multiple VR users with mmWave analog beamforming. Specifically, this scheme contains an analog beamforming weight determination function and a frequency-division user scheduling function, which are executed iteratively with the increasing number of selected users. Therein, the proposed multi-beam analog beamforming pattern generation method is able to generate arbitrary number of beams with flexible beam directions, beam widths and beamforming gain ratios, by the constant-modulus weights with one radio-frequency chain. It is demonstrated by the simulation results that the proposed multi-beam multi-access scheme increases 200% for the maximum number of simultaneously served VR uplink users than the traditional single-beam multi-access scheme in 5G systems with mmWave analog beamforming. © 2018 IEEE.","Analog Beamforming; Millimeter-Wave; Multi-Beam; Multiple Access; Scheduling; Wireless Virtual Reality","5G mobile communication systems; Beamforming; Flexible structures; Iterative methods; Scheduling; Virtual reality; Analog beamforming; Millimeter waves (mmwave); Multibeams; Multiple access; Multiple access scheme; Radio frequency chains; Traffic characteristics; Ultra high data rates; Millimeter waves","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050261393"

Methods Hospital records of non-critically ill patients treated with basal insulin prior to admission were identified. After exclusion of records in which a confounding factor influencing insulin dosing was present, 258 patient-admissions over a 3-year time period were included. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between adjustments to home insulin total daily dose (TDD) and inpatient glycemic control within the first 48 h, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results On hospital days 1 (HD1) and 2 (HD2), the home insulin TDD was reduced by 43.5% and 23.9%, respectively. Reductions in the home TDD ranging from 10% to 50% were not associated with normoglycemia or hyperglycemia, whereas increases ranging from 10% to 50% were associated with 2–5-fold increased odds of hyperglycemia. For patients with home insulin TDD ≥0.4 units/kg/day, a weight-based dose of 0.4–0.6 units/kg/day was associated with significantly higher odds of normoglycemia on HD2 (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.42–11.21) compared to lower doses. Conclusions Compared to less aggressive increases, home insulin dose increases ranging from 10% to 50% were associated with greater odds of hyperglycemia without increased odds of hypoglycemia during early hospitalization.

However, in addition to conventional interference, the cross-link interference (CI) resulted by asymmetric uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission in D-TDD operation may further degrade system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic interference mitigation (OIM) framework to enhance D-TDD in UDNs by exploiting multi-user diversity in conjunction with interference-aware transmission. In particular, we first decompose the interference patterns experienced by D-TDD in a typical three- cell network, and propose novel interference alignment (IA) inspired opportunistic user scheduling and transmission schemes for each interference pattern. Our scheme mainly relies on the reference signal space (RSS) that guides the transmit beamforming and user scheduling to align the generated interference at a predefined subspace in each AP receiver with best effort. Numerical results show that our schemes can effectively mitigate the CI in D-TDD, and in conjunction with modified opportunistic IA for pure UL/DL transmission, our OIM framework achieves substantial performance again over the conventional schemes. © 2018 IEEE.","","Scheduling; Signal receivers; Conventional schemes; Interference alignment; Interference mitigation; Interference patterns; Multiuser diversity; Transmission schemes; Transmit beamforming; Ultra-dense networks; Time division multiplexing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050280841"

The ordered structure is metastable in the bulk, so any glissile dislocation that disrupts the ordered pattern will release stored energy, and experience an increased glide force. Here we show how this connection between atomic ordering and dislocation glide force can be exploited to control the threading dislocation density (TDD) in GaxIn1−xP CGBs. When ordered GaxIn1−xP is graded from the GaAs lattice constant to InP, the order parameter η decreases as x decreases, and dislocation glide switches from one set of glide planes to the other. This glide plane switch (GPS) is accompanied by the nucleation of dislocations on the new glide plane, which typically leads to increased TDD. We develop control of the GPS position within a GaxIn1−xP CGB through manipulation of deposition temperature, surfactant concentration, and strain-grading rate. We demonstrate a two-stage GaxIn1−xP CGB from GaAs to InP with sufficiently low TDD for high performance devices, such as the 4-junction inverted metamorphic multi-junction solar cell, achieved through careful control the GPS position.

The proposed solution relies on flexible slicing considering the entire spectrum band, wherein service oriented slices can independently adopt and adjust an UL/DL ratio reflecting traffic conditions. To this end, this paper initially describes and analyses the inter-slice resource allocation problem taking into account different TDD patterns, the slice traffic load and the inter-node interference, which originates by multiple and diverse sources. In this context, a graph-based framework is proposed to reduce the complexity of the problem by decoupling it in two sub-problems: the selection of TDD patterns to find which links should be activated at particular time instances and accordingly perform graph-based resource allocation for all slice traffic collectively. Our performance evaluations show significant enhancements of the UL and DL throughput respectively. © 2018 IEEE.","5G; Network Slicing; RRM; TDD","Graphic methods; Resource allocation; Time division multiplexing; Inter node interferences; Network slicing; Performance evaluations; Resource allocation problem; Resource management; Service requirements; Time division duplex; Traffic conditions; 5G mobile communication systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051430086"

Two of them concern the test and code relationship, namely isolation (unit tests should examine only a single unit) and separation (they should be placed next to this unit). These guidelines are not always kept by the developers. They can however be checked by investigating the relationship between tests and the source code, which is described by test-to-code traceability links. Still, these links perhaps cannot be inferred unambiguously from the test and production code. We developed a method that is based on the computation of traceability links for different aspects and report Structural Unit Test Smells where the traceability links for the different aspects do not match. The two aspects are the static structure of the code that reflects the intentions of the developers and testers and the dynamic coverage which reveals the actual behavior of the code during test execution. In this study, we investigated this method on real programs. We manually checked the reported Structural Unit Test Smells to find out whether they are real violations of the unit testing rules. Furthermore, the smells were analyzed to determine their root causes and possible ways of correction. Copyright © 2018 Institute of Informatics, University of Szeged.

For this, the fully integrated system, consisting of software and hardware, is investigated for remaining bugs using system tests. Unlike unit tests, these tests involve human interaction with the system and are mostly performed manually, without any tool support for their simulation or adequacy examination. Thus, important functionality can be overlooked during testing, decreasing the overall system quality. Coverage measurement during testing can be a valuable support for assessing test adequacy, but requires instrumentation that might influence the real time behavior of the system. Further, test adequacy cannot be calculated until all tests have been executed. To tackle these problems, we propose an approach that aims at estimating coverage criteria prior to system test execution at the aPS and without instrumenting the code or defining hardware simulations. To this end, the nominal hardware behavior and human interaction models are derived from existing integration tests, enabling a priori estimation of the system test coverage via simulation of the software along with the deduced behavior. © 2017 IEEE.","Manufacturing automation; Programmable logic devices; Software quality; System testing","Automatic test pattern generation; Behavioral research; Computer software selection and evaluation; Factory automation; Hardware; Logic devices; Program debugging; Automated production systems; Hardware simulation; Human interaction model; Manufacturing Automation; Programmable logic device; Software and hardwares; Software Quality; System testing; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044463087"

Despite the benefits of being descriptive, test names often fall short of this goal. In this paper we present a new approach for automatically generating descriptive names for existing test bodies. Using a combination of natural-language program analysis and text generation, the technique creates names that summarize the test's scenario and the expected outcome.

To gain insight into the processes that control the hydrologic response of such systems the role played by groundwater in an alpine basin located at the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula is investigated. As data in these environments is generally scarce and its variability is high, simple lumped parameter hydrological models that consider the groundwater component and snow accumulation and melting are needed. Instead of using existing models that use many parameters, the Témez lumped hydrological model of common use in Spain and Ibero-American countries is selected and modified to consider snow to get a simplified tool to separate hydrograph components. The result is the TDD model (Témez-Degree Day) which is applied in a high mountain watershed with seasonal snow cover in Southern Spain to help in quantifying groundwater recharge and determining the groundwater contribution to the outflow. Average groundwater recharge is about 23% of the precipitation, and groundwater contribution to total outflow ranges between 70 and 97%. Direct surface runoff is 1% of precipitation. These values depend on the existence of snow. Results are consistent with those obtained with chloride atmospheric deposition mass balances by other authors.

Existing techniques mainly focus on detecting data race bugs with pattern analysis, however, (1) the number of interleaving patterns could be huge, (2) only most suspicious write-read pattern is given, and (3) an oracle is needed which is not available in the operational phase. This paper proposes a program invariant based technique to detect a class of concurrent program bugs. By unit testing of some component of a concurrent program, we obtain a set of program invariants, which can be used as an oracle to get 'bad' invariants when the program is online. By building the function call graph of the component and applying reduction technique invariants, we compute the candidates of suspicious functions and rank them. From interactions among components, we can analyze the cause of concurrency bugs. Experimental results have shown that our proposed technique is effective in concurrency bug detection and cause analysis. © 2016 IEEE.","Fault detection; Function call graph; Program invariants; Suspicious Rate","Computer software selection and evaluation; Fault detection; Program debugging; Software reliability; Software testing; Concurrency bugs; Concurrent program; Debugging process; Function-call graphs; Operational phase; Pattern analysis; Program invariants; Reduction techniques; C (programming language)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991780868"

This paper takes an instrumental variable (IV) approach to establish individual-unit test statistics for no cointegration that are robust to variance non-stationarity. The sign of a fitted departure from long-run equilibrium is used as an instrument when estimating an error-correction model. The resulting IV-based test is shown to follow a chi-square limiting null distribution irrespective of the variance pattern of the data-generating process. In spite of this, the test proposed here has, unlike previous work relying on instrumental variables, competitive local power against sequences of local alternatives in 1/T-neighbourhoods of the null. The standard limiting null distribution motivates, using the single-unit tests in a multiple testing approach for cointegration in multi-country data sets by combining P-values from individual units. Simulations suggest good performance of the single-unit and multiple testing procedures under various plausible designs of cross-sectional correlation and cross-unit cointegration in the data. An application to the equilibrium relationship between short- and long-term interest rates illustrates the dramatic differences between results of robust and non-robust tests. © 2017 The Department of Economics, University of Oxford and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031704856"

In this paper, we report on our experience in supporting industrial partners in introducing the EvoSuite automated JUnit test generation tool in their software development processes. The first step consisted of providing a plugin to the Apache Maven build infrastructure. The move from a research-oriented point-and-click tool to an automated step of the build process has implications on how developers interact with the tool and generated tests, and therefore, we produced a plugin for the popular IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE). As build automation is a core component of Continuous Integration (CI), we provide a further plugin to the Jenkins CI system, which allows developers to monitor the results of EvoSuite and integrate generated tests in their source tree. In this paper, we discuss the resulting architecture of the plugins, and the challenges arising when building such plugins. Although the plugins described are targeted for the EvoSuite tool, they can be adapted and their architecture can be reused for other test generation tools as well. © 2016 IEEE.","","Automatic test pattern generation; Automation; Object oriented programming; Software design; Software engineering; Verification; Web services; Continuous integrations; Core components; Industrial partners; Integrated development environment; Object-oriented class; Software development process; Test generations; Unit test generations; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983349457"

Previous studies on open source systems have shown that test generation tools are quite effective at detecting faults, but how effective and applicable are they in an industrial application? In this paper, we investigate this question using a life insurance and pension products calculator engine owned by SEB Life & Pension Holding AB Riga Branch. To study fault-finding effectiveness, we extracted 25 real faults from the version history of this software project, and applied two up-to-date unit test generation tools for Java, EVOSUITE and RANDOOP, which implement search-based and feedback-directed random test generation, respectively. Automatically generated test suites detected up to 56.40% (EVOSUITE) and 38.00% (RANDOOP) of these faults. The analysis of our results demonstrates challenges that need to be addressed in order to improve fault detection in test generation tools. In particular, classification of the undetected faults shows that 97.62% of them depend on either 'specific primitive values' (50.00%) or the construction of 'complex state configuration of objects' (47.62%). To study applicability, we surveyed the developers of the application under test on their experience and opinions about the test generation tools and the generated test cases. This leads to insights on requirements for academic prototypes for successful technology transfer from academic research to industrial practice, such as a need to integrate with popular build tools, and to improve the readability of the generated tests. © 2017 IEEE.","Automated Tests Generation; Empirical Software Engineering; Random Testing; Search-based Testing","Automatic test pattern generation; Computer software; Fault detection; Industrial research; Insurance; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Technology transfer; Testing; Application under tests; Automated test; Automatically generated; Empirical Software Engineering; Industrial evaluations; Random test generation; Random testing; Search-based testing; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026838407"

In two-stage beamforming, a new algorithm for statistical pre-beamformer design is proposed for spatially correlated time-varying wideband MIMO channels under the assumption that the channel is a stationary Gauss-Markov random process. The proposed algorithm yields a nearly optimal pre-beamformer whose beam pattern is designed sequentially with low complexity by taking the user-grouping into account, and exploiting the properties of Kalman filtering and associated prediction error covariance matrices. The resulting design, based on the second order statistical properties of the channel, generates beamspace on which the RR Kalman estimator can be realized as accurately as possible. It is observed that the adaptive channel estimation technique together with the proposed sequential beamspace construction shows remarkable robustness to the pilot interference. This comes with significant reduction in both pilot overhead and dimension of the pre-beamformer lowering both hardware complexity and power consumption. © 2017 IEEE.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028353192"

The identified immaturity of existing APAAS solutions might have implications for courses that rely deeply on automation like MOOCs. Therefore, we conclude to look at APAAS solutions much more from a security point of view (code injection).

Symbolic execution has been used as an effective way of automatically generating test data that meet those criteria. Although this technique has been used for over three decades, several challenges remain and there is a lack of research on how often they appear in real-world applications. In this paper, we analyzed two samples of open source Java projects in order to understand the characteristics that may hinder the generation of unit test data using symbolic execution.

The second sample, called R47, is a set of 47 well-known and mature projects we selected from different repositories.

However, its implementation is usually based on linear precoding schemes using Channel State Information (CSI). For this reason, the use of the Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode is typically assumed since it removes the dependence on the number of antennas at the transmitter to acquire CSI. Unfortunately, most of the cellular network operate in the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode in which the acquisition of CSI depends proportionally to the number of transmit antennas. For this reason, the implementation of Massive MIMO is handicapped to few transmit antennas for the current cellular networks. In this paper we study the use of reconfigurable antennas that can switch among a set of preset modes, i.e., radiation patterns, through Blind Interference Alignment schemes. We show that it is a solution to exploit a very large number of antennas at the transmit side, overcoming the bottleneck that today constitutes the acquisition of CSI in Massive MIMO systems operating in FDD mode. © 2017 IEEE.","","Channel state information; Frequency division multiplexing; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Wireless networks; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular network; Frequency-division duplexes; Interference alignment; Linear precoding scheme; Reconfigurable antenna; Spectral efficiencies; Time-division-duplex modes; Transmit antenna; Directional patterns (antenna)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019727677"

Objective: The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-practice of quality assurance during the implementation phase in software houses. Method: For this purpose, we conducted a survey in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where 57 software houses participated. The questionnaire comprised questions regarding techniques, tools, and effort for software quality assurance during implementation as well as the perceived quality after implementation. The results were complemented by interviews and results from other surveys on software quality in general. Results: Results from the survey show that the most common software quality assurance techniques used during implementation are unit testing, code reviews and coding guidelines. Most tool support is used in the areas of bug tracking, version control and project management. Due to relationships between the used tool types, it seems that the introduction of one tool leads to the adoption of several others. Also quality assurance techniques and tools are correlated. Bug fixing takes a significant ratio of the overall project effort assigned to implementation. Furthermore, we found that the more developers a software company has, the more effort is spent on bug fixing. Finally, more than half of all companies rated the quality after implementation as rather good to good. Conclusion: For the most important quality assurance techniques and supporting tool types clear usage patterns can be seen and serve as a basis to provide guidelines on their application in practice. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Implementation; Software development; Software houses; Software quality; Software quality assurance; Survey","Codes (symbols); Houses; Project management; Quality assurance; Quality control; Software design; Software engineering; Software testing; Static analysis; Surveying; Surveys; Implementation; Perceived quality; Quality of softwares; Software house; Software Quality; Software quality assurance; State of practice; Techniques and tools; Computer software selection and evaluation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010192462"

Unfortunately, current techniques often fail to provide relevant input values, such as strings that bypass domain-specific sanity checks. As a result, state-of-the-art techniques are effective for generic classes, such as collections, but less successful for domain-specific software. This paper presents TestMiner, the first technique for mining a corpus of existing tests for input values to be used by test generators for effectively testing software not in the corpus. The main idea is to extract literals from thousands of tests and to adapt information retrieval techniques to find values suitable for a particular domain. Evaluating the approach with 40 Java classes from 18 different projects shows that TestMiner improves test coverage by 21% over an existing test generator. The approach can be integrated into various test generators in a straightforward way, increasing their effectiveness on previously difficult-to-test classes. © 2017 IEEE.","","Automatic test pattern generation; Software engineering; Complex software; Domain specific; Generating unit; Generic class; State-of-the-art techniques; Test coverage; Test generations; Testing software; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041446583"

In this paper, we present a new feature extraction framework that aims to give an enhanced representation of muscular activities through increasing the amount of information that can be extracted from individual and combined electromyogram (EMG) channels. We propose to use time-domain descriptors (TDDs) in estimating the EMG signal power spectrum characteristics; a step that preserves the computational power required for the construction of spectral features. Subsequently, TDD is used in a process that involves: 1) representing the temporal evolution of the EMG signals by progressively tracking the correlation between the TDD extracted from each analysis time window and a nonlinearly mapped version of it across the same EMG channel and 2) representing the spatial coherence between the different EMG channels, which is achieved by calculating the correlation between the TDD extracted from the differences of all possible combinations of pairs of channels and their nonlinearly mapped versions. The proposed temporal-spatial descriptors (TSDs) are validated on multiple sparse and high-density (HD) EMG data sets collected from a number of intact-limbed and amputees performing a large number of hand and finger movements. Classification results showed significant reductions in the achieved error rates in comparison to other methods, with the improvement of at least 8% on average across all subjects. Additionally, the proposed TSDs achieved significantly well in problems with HD-EMG with average classification errors of <5% across all subjects using windows lengths of 50 ms only. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","feature extraction; Myoelectric control; pattern recognition; transradial amputees","Adult; Algorithms; Amputation Stumps; Amputees; Databases, Factual; Electrodes; Electromyography; Female; Fingers; Hand; Humans; Male; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Nonlinear Dynamics; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Prostheses and Implants; Young Adult; Artificial limbs; Electromyography; Extraction; Feature extraction; Myoelectrically controlled prosthetics; Pattern recognition; Prosthetics; Time domain analysis; Amount of information; Classification errors; Classification results; Computational power; Muscular activities; Myoelectric control; Spectrum characteristic; transradial amputees; adult; algorithm; amputee; arm amputation; Article; conceptual framework; electromyography; female; human; male; mathematical and statistical procedures; movement (physiology); pattern recognition; power spectrum; prediction; temporal spatial descriptor; young adult; amputation stump; anatomy and histology; automated pattern recognition; electrode; factual database; finger; hand; nonlinear system; procedures; prostheses and orthoses; skeletal muscle; Biomedical signal processing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032971509"

Here, low-cost AlN buffer layers were sputtered on cone-shaped patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs) to obtain high-quality GaN epilayers. Without any mask or regrowth, facet-controlled epitaxial lateral overgrowth was realized by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The uniform coating of the sputtered AlN buffer layer and the optimized multiple modulation guaranteed high growth selectivity and uniformity of the GaN epilayer. As a result, an extremely smooth surface was achieved with an average roughness of 0.17 nm over 3 × 3 μm2. It was found that the sputtered AlN buffer layer could significantly suppress dislocations on the cones. Moreover, the optimized three-dimensional growth process could effectively promote dislocation bending. Therefore, the threading dislocation density (TDD) of the GaN epilayer was reduced to 4.6 × 107 cm-2, which is about an order of magnitude lower than the case of two-step GaN on the PSS. In addition, contamination and crack in the light-emitting diode fabricated on the obtained GaN were also effectively suppressed by using the sputtered AlN buffer layer. All of these advantages led to a high output power of 116 mW at 500 mA with an emission wavelength of 375 nm. This simple, yet effective growth technique is believed to have great application prospects in high-performance TDD-sensitive optoelectronic and electronic devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","epitaxial lateral overgrowth; facet-controlled; GaN; MOCVD; patterned sapphire substrate; sputtered AlN","Aluminum compounds; Buffer layers; Epilayers; Epitaxial growth; Gallium compounds; Gallium nitride; Metallorganic chemical vapor deposition; Optical waveguides; Organic chemicals; Organometallics; Quality control; Sapphire; Substrates; Application prospect; Emission wavelength; Epitaxial lateral overgrowth; Facet controlled epitaxial lateral overgrowths; facet-controlled; Patterned sapphire substrate; Threading dislocation densities; Three-dimensional growth; Vanadium compounds","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038216456"

The ice road season start, end and duration principally depend upon ice thickness, which is controlled by surface air temperature (SAT) in terms of freezing and thawing degree-days (FDD and TDD, respectively). Both FDD and TDD are indicators of climate variability and change, and are naturally influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs). This study examined the role of ACPs in interannual variations in the operating season of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road in the Bay of Bothnia, northern Baltic Sea, during 1974–2009. Significant (p <.05) shortening in duration of the ice road season, mainly attributable to later start and earlier end days, was observed. In the Oulu-Hailuoto area, maximum ice thickness showed significant declines over time. This sea ice thinning was associated with SAT warming in cold months, manifested by statistically significant decreases in cumulative FDD during October–January within the water year (September–August). Significant increases in cumulative TDD during February–April, reflecting warmer SAT in mild months, resulted in earlier end day for the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) was the most influential ACP for variations in cumulative FDD (October–January), and accordingly for sea ice thickness and start day of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. However, cumulative TDD (February–April) showed significant positive correlations with the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, which also controlled the end day of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric circulation pattern; Baltic Sea; Ice road season; Ice thickness","Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Bothnian Bay; Gulf of Bothnia; Climate change; Climatology; Meteorology; Roads and streets; Sea ice; Transportation routes; Atmospheric circulation patterns; Baltic sea; Climate variability and change; Ice roads; Ice thickness; Positive correlations; Surface air temperatures; Temperature variability; air temperature; annual variation; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate variation; cold region; ice thickness; surface temperature; temperature effect; warming; Ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043471049"

Since this is a time-consuming task, in last years many approaches and tools for automatic test case generation-such as EvoSuite-have been introduced. Nevertheless, developers have to maintain and evolve tests to sustain the changes in the source code; therefore, having readable test cases is important to ease such a process. However, it is still not clear whether developers make an effort in writing readable unit tests. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct an explorative study comparing the readability of manually written test cases with the classes they test. Moreover, we deepen such analysis looking at the readability of automatically generated test cases.

Therefore, we explore the theory of fault distributions, originating in the quantitative analysis by Fenton and Ohlsson, in the weakly explored context of unit verification in large-scale software development. We conduct a quantitative case study on a sequence of four development projects on consecutive releases of the same complex software product line system for telecommunication exchanges. We replicate the operationalization from earlier studies, analyzed hypotheses related to the Pareto principle of fault distribution, persistence of faults, effects of module size, and quality in terms of fault densities, however, now from the perspective of unit verification. The patterns in unit verification results resemble those of later verification phases, e.g., regarding the Pareto principle, and may thus be used for prediction and planning purposes.

When unit tests are generated automatically, however, they tend to be given non-descriptive names such as ""test0"", which provide none of the benefits a descriptive name can give a test. The underlying challenge is that automatically generated tests typically do not represent real scenarios and have no clear purpose other than covering code, which makes naming them difficult. In this paper, we present an automated approach which generates descriptive names for automatically generated unit tests by summarizing API-level coverage goals. The tests are optimized to be short, descriptive of the test, have a clear relation to the covered code under test, and allow developers to uniquely distinguish tests in a test suite. An empirical evaluation with 47 participants shows that developers agree with the synthesized names, and the synthesized names are equally descriptive as manually written names. Study participants were even more accurate and faster at matching code and tests with synthesized names compared to manually derived names. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Automated unit test generation; Name synthesis; Test naming","Automatic test pattern generation; Codes (symbols); Testing; Automated approach; Automated units; Automatically generated; Covering codes; Descriptive names; Empirical evaluations; Generating unit; Unit tests; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026658442"

Despite its flexibility, the TDD mode suffers from sophisticated interference patterns, i.e. mobile-To-mobile and Base station-To-Base Station interference. In order to solve this problem, the 3GPP has specified a set of methods for interference mitigation and traffic adaptation (IMTA). Cell clustering is one of these methods, where cells are organized in clusters. Inside each cluster, cells shall have the same frame configuration.

Additionally, a lot of literature deals with this topic. Therefore, it can be expected that it is widely used among developers. Despite its importance, there is no empirical study which investigates, whether unit tests are used by developers in real life projects at all. This paper presents such a study, where we collected and analyzed data from over 70K revisions of 10 different Python projects. Based on two different definitions of unit testing, we calculated the actual number of unit tests and compared it with the expected number (as inferred from the intentions of the developers), had a look at the mocking behavior of developers, and at the evolution of the number of unit tests. Our main findings show, (i) that developers believe that they are developing more unit tests than they actually do, (ii) most projects have a very small amount of unit tests, (iii) developers make use of mocks, but these do not have a significant influence on the number of unit tests, (iv) four different patterns for the evolution of the number of unit tests could be detected, and (v) the used unit test definition has an influence on the results. © 2017 IEEE.","","Computer programming; High level languages; Open source software; Testing; Verification; Empirical studies; EXtreme Programming; Open sources; Software life cycle model; Test driven development; Unit testing; Unit tests; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020732498"

However, research is lacking in what kind of programmatic interventions virtual schools might be particularly well-suited to provide to improve math performance. Engaging students in self-reflection is a potentially promising pedagogical approach for supporting math learning. Nonetheless, it is unclear how models for math learning in brick and mortar classrooms translate in an online learning environment. The purpose of this study was to (a) analyze assessment data from virtual schools to explore the association between self-reflection and math performance, (b) compare the patterns found in student self-reflection across elementary, middle, and high school levels, and (c) examine whether providing opportunities for self-reflection had positive impact on math performance in an online learning environment. In this study, the self-reflection assessments were developed and administered multiple times within several math courses during the 2014-15 school year. These assessments included 4- 7 questions that asked students to reflect on their understanding of the knowledge and skills they learned in the preceding lessons and units. Using these assessments, multiple constructs and indicators were measured, which included confidence about the topic knowledge/understanding, general feelings towards math, accuracy of self-judgment against actual test performance, and frequency of self-reflection. Through a series of three retrospective studies, data were collected from full-time virtual school students who took three math courses (one elementary, one middle, and one high school math course) in eight virtual schools in the United States during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years. The results showed that (a) participation in self-reflection varied by grade, unit test performance level, and course/topic difficulty; (b) more frequent participation in self-reflection and higher self-confidence level were associated with higher final course performance; and (c) self-reflection, as was implemented here, showed limited impact for more difficult topics, higher grade courses, and higher performing students.

In the course unit, student teams were asked to make changes to a large open source software system, and to maintain clean release builds as they did so. Release build health (in terms of compiling code and passing unit tests) was explicitly included in the marking scheme for the coursework. We set up a continuous integration server to keep track of student build health. Initially, this was used only by TAs in marking student work, but for later cohorts we provided access to continuous integration results to all students from the early stages of each exercise. This has provided us with data on the changing patterns of student build health, with differing access to the CI server, giving an insight into how students learn to manage build health and the effects of allowing them access to CI results. We found evidence of a clear improvement in ability to manage build health when CI facilities are made available, but that some student teams were not making use of the facilities to much effect. The improvement effect was strongest on the build health of release builds, corresponding to the area of greatest marks in the marking scheme. The CI results also proved to be very valuable for academic staff, in making the problems with student builds visible. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Build health; Continuous integration; Release quality; Software engineering education","Curricula; Health; Integration; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Academic staff; Continuous integrations; Keep track of; Open source software systems; Software engineering course; Student teams; Team projects; Undergraduate students; Students","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061092448"

Areas covered: The present review intends to summarize what is already known regarding early STIT in T2DM and highlight questions and dilemmas from the clinician’s point of view, with a discourse on future research agenda. Expert opinion: STIT has the potential to modify the natural history of T2DM, resulting in improved drug-free remission rates by favorably affecting the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Existing data in the field manifest significant weaknesses, mainly being the small number of trials and patients included, the lack of control groups in most studies and the wide heterogeneity between study designs and explored outcomes, which limit definitive conclusions. Therefore, before such a therapeutic strategy is incorporated into daily practice, important issues require further clarification by future trials. These issues include the optimal time point for the intervention, the ideal insulin type, the identification of patients being most likely to benefit, the STIT effects on cardiovascular and other clinical outcomes and the cost-effectiveness evaluation of this therapeutic strategy.

Several search-based techniques have proved successful at automatically generating tests that achieve high coverage. However, despite the well-established arguments behind using evolutionary search algorithms (eg, genetic algorithms) in preference to random search, it remains an open question whether the benefits can actually be observed in practice when generating unit test suites for object-oriented classes. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the effects of using evolutionary algorithms (including a genetic algorithm and chemical reaction optimization) to generate test suites, compared with generating test suites incrementally with random search. We apply the EVOSUITE unit test suite generator to 1000 classes randomly selected from the SF110 corpus of open-source projects. Surprisingly, the results show that the difference is much smaller than one might expect: While evolutionary search covers more branches of the type where standard fitness functions provide guidance, we observed that, in practice, the vast majority of branches do not provide any guidance to the search. These results suggest that, although evolutionary algorithms are more effective at covering complex branches, a random search may suffice to achieve high coverage of most object-oriented classes.

In this scenario, after the contention among the secondary nodes, the winner node transmits its data packet in the empty resource blocks (RBs) of downlink and uplink subframes of the primary network. Regarding the OFDMA structure as well as time-scheduled resources in the primary network, the time duration of opportunities for the secondary network does not follow simple exponential on-off pattern. To model the dynamic behavior of opportunities for secondary nodes as well as contentions to exploit the opportunities, we propose an analytical model comprised of a discrete-Time Markov chain and two inter-related open multi-class queueing networks (QNs). The effects of the random number of empty resource blocks at different frames as the result of random amount of download and upload data, random packet transmission time at WLAN, the dependency of the number of empty RBs at consecutive frames, and the details of 802.11 MAC protocol are included in our analytical approach.

In this article, we explore a pairwise coverage criterion to select a subset of test sequences satisfying the pattern, in order to decrease the number of test sequences.

Sincewriting good tests can be difficult and tedious, unit tests canalso be generated automatically. However, maintaining these tests(e.g., when APIs change, or, when tests represent outdated andchanged behavior), is still a manual task. Because automaticallygenerated tests may have no clear purpose other than coveringcode, maintaining them may be more difficult than maintainingmanually written tests. Could this maintenance be avoided bysimply generating new tests after each change, and disposingthe old ones? We propose disposable testing: Tests are generatedto reveal any behavioral differences caused by a code change, and are thrown away once the developer confirms whetherthese changes were intended or not. However, this idea raisesseveral research challenges: First, are standard automated testgeneration techniques good enough to produce tests that may berelied upon to reveal changes as effectively as an incrementallybuilt regression test suite? Second, does disposable testing reducethe overall effort, or would developers need to inspect moregenerated tests compared to just maintaining existing ones? © 2017 IEEE.","Automated Regression Testing; Automated Test Generation; Coverage-driven Testing; Differential Testing; Disposable Testing; Regression Test Generation; Regression Testing; Unit Test Generation; Unit Testing","Automatic programming; Automatic test pattern generation; Automation; C (programming language); Regression analysis; Software engineering; Testing; Automated regression testing; Automated test generations; Differential testing; Regression testing; Regression tests; Unit test generations; Unit testing; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026768542"

Such turbo-gears are API 613 compliant (Titled as-Special Purpose Gear Units for Petroleum, Chemical, and Gas Industry Services) and have horizontal offset transmission line, with journal bearings on the high speed shaft and low speed shaft. When a full load full speed complete unit test is carried out, pinion dynamic behavior is found to be different than what observed during full speed no load condition as mandated in API 613 . During this test, gear box high speed pinion may show up with high vibration or combination of both during certain load and speed combination in spite of proper balancing and alignment. Since full load full speed test is kept as an option in API 613 , hence these type of vibration may not be detected during a no load test in gear box manufacturer's premises. These types of vibration patterns are not explicitly addressed in API 613 . The first objective of this paper is to cover analytical, design and diagnostic aspects which can be helpful to mitigate above issues before it is towed out from manufacturer's premises.

The controller gains are optimized by an Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO) method. The improvement in GWO method is done by an approach which does not consider less important delta wolves for updating the position vector in the hunting stages of the algorithm thus making the algorithm simpler with less implementation time. Proposed IGWO is initially evaluated using some standard test functions. The outcomes are equated with GWO, modified GWO (MGWO), Differential Evolution (DE), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques to illustrate its supremacy. The IGWO algorithm is then employed to optimize PID, hybridized structure of Fuzzy PD and cascade PI-PD(FPD/PI-PD) and fuzzy based PID parameters for frequency regulation of two-area power system. The superiority of fuzzy PID is established over recently proposed Automatic Generation Control (AGC) approaches. In the second stage, the methodology is applied to a two-area six-unit test system with diverse sources and supremacy of the proposed approach is established over optimal feedback controller, DE tuned PID and TLBO tuned 2DOF PID for the same test system. Finally, the suggested technique is used in a three area nonlinear test system and the supremacy of suggested approach over IGWO tuned FPD/PI-PD and hybrid Firefly Algorithm-Pattern Search (hFA–PS) tuned fuzzy PID is shown.

The incidence and frequency of microbiological micro-organisms are known to vary across different models of intensive care units. To date, no study has attempted to describe the different findings in burn patients treated in an open, general intensive care unit (GICU) versus a dedicated burns intensive care unit (BICU). Only limited data is available on the effect of these microbiological micro-organisms on patients’ length of stay. Aim To characterize and compare the microbiological flora and antibiotic resistance patterns encountered in two different models of burn intensive care and to determine the effect of specific microbiological types on length of intensive care unit (ICU) and overall stay. Methods A retrospective case-control study of 209 burn patients treated in two highly specialized, Western burn referral centres between September 2009 and March 2014. Results 9710 culture results were analysed, of which 2590 (26.7%) yielded positive results (1537 in the GICU and 1050 in the BICU). Gram-positive cultures were more frequently found in the GICU, whereas Gram-negative and yeast cultures were more prevalent in the BICU. The most frequently encountered micro-organisms in both units were similar and included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Candida albicans. Significantly more resistant bacteria were detected in the BICU. Testing positive across all types of microbiological isolates, as well as for both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria significantly prolonged patient length of stay. This effect was even more pronounced if the micro-organisms were resistant to antimicrobial therapy. Conclusion There are notable differences in the microbiological isolate and antibiotic resistance patterns between burn patients treated in a GICU compared to a designated BICU. In both units, testing positive for resistant microbiological micro-organisms is significantly associated with longer hospital stay. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI","Burns; Designated; General; Intensive care unit; Microbiology","Adult; Bacteremia; Burn Units; Burns; Candida albicans; Candidiasis; Case-Control Studies; Catheter-Related Infections; Catheterization, Peripheral; Cross Infection; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; New South Wales; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas Infections; Respiratory Tract Infections; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Urinary Tract Infections; Wound Infection; animal model; antibiotic resistance; antimicrobial therapy; burn patient; Candida albicans; case control study; coagulase negative Staphylococcus; controlled study; disease model; drug resistance; fungal cell culture; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; length of stay; major clinical study; microbiology; microorganism; normal human; patient referral; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus; yeast; adult; antibiotic resistance; bacteremia; burn unit; Burns; candidiasis; Catheter-Related Infections; catheterization; comparative study; cross infection; female; length of stay; male; microbiology; middle aged; New South Wales; Pseudomonas Infections; Respiratory Tract Infections; Staphylococcal Infections; statistics and numerical data; Urinary Tract Infections; wound infection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977655873"

However, automatically generated tests are usually not based on realistic scenarios, and are therefore generally considered to be less readable. This places a question mark over their practical value: Every time a test fails, a developer has to decide whether this failure has revealed a regression fault in the program under test, or whether the test itself needs to be updated. Does the fact that automatically generated tests are harder to read outweigh the time-savings gained by their automated generation, and render them more of a hindrance than a help for software maintenance? In order to answer this question, we performed an empirical study in which participants were presented with an automatically generated or manually written failing test, and were asked to identify and fix the cause of the failure. Our experiment and two replications resulted in a total of 150 data points based on 75 participants. Whilst maintenance activities take longer when working with automatically generated tests, we found developers to be equally effective with manually written and automatically generated tests. This has implications on how automated test generation is best used in practice, and it indicates a need for research into the generation of more realistic tests. © 2018 IEEE.","Automated test generation; Empirical software engineering; Software maintenance; Software testing; Test maintenance","Automatic test pattern generation; Automation; Computer software maintenance; Verification; Automated generation; Automated test generations; Automatically generated; Empirical Software Engineering; Empirical studies; Maintenance activity; Realistic scenario; Test maintenances; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048422287"

While these novel approaches provide new insights into neuroimaging data, they often have unexpected properties, generating a growing literature on possible pitfalls. We propose to meet this challenge by adopting a habit of systematic testing of experimental design, analysis procedures, and statistical inference. Specifically, we suggest to apply the analysis method used for experimental data also to aspects of the experimental design, simulated confounds, simulated null data, and control data. We stress the importance of keeping the analysis method the same in main and test analyses, because only this way possible confounds and unexpected properties can be reliably detected and avoided. We describe and discuss this Same Analysis Approach in detail, and demonstrate it in two worked examples using multivariate decoding. With these examples, we reveal two sources of error: A mismatch between counterbalancing (crossover designs) and cross-validation which leads to systematic below-chance accuracies, and linear decoding of a nonlinear effect, a difference in variance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Below-chance accuracies; Confounds; Cross validation; Experimental design; Multivariate pattern analysis; Unit testing","Brain; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Neuroimaging; analytical error; analytical parameters; Article; brain region; classification; experimental design; functional magnetic resonance imaging; image analysis; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; neuroimaging; nonlinear system; priority journal; reliability; statistical analysis; stimulus response; stress; validation study; visual stimulation; brain; human; multivariate analysis; neuroimaging; physiology; procedures; standards","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040764627"

Given their widespread use, there is a need to quickly qualify them and accurately predict the reliability of these devices. Due to their inherently long operational life, most LED reliability studies involve the use of degradation tests and application of filter-based prognostic techniques for dynamic update of degradation model parameters and estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL). Although they are in general very effective, the main drawback is the need for a specific state-space model that describes the degradation. In many cases, LED degradation trends are affected by a multitude of unknown factors such as unidentified failure modes, varying operational conditions, process and measurement variance, and environmental fluctuations. These variable factors that are hard to control tend to complicate the selection of a suitable state-space model and in some cases; there may not be a single model that could be used for the entire lifespan of the device. If the degradation patterns of LEDs under test deviate from the state space models, the resulting predictions will be inaccurate. This paper introduces a prognostics-based qualification method using a multi-output Gaussian process regression (MO-GPR) and applies it to RUL prediction of high-power LED devices. The main idea here is to use MO-GPR to learn the correlation between similar degradation patterns from multiple similar components under test and thereby, bypass the need for a specific state space model using available data of past units tested to failure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Gaussian process regression; Light emitting diode; Prognostic health management; Remaining useful life","Diodes; Environmental technology; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Outages; Regression analysis; State space methods; Environmental fluctuations; Gaussian process regression; Light emitting diode (LEDs); Operational conditions; Prognostic health managements; Qualification methods; Remaining useful life predictions; Remaining useful lives; Light emitting diodes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054821471"

Epigenetic processes established in utero that affect dopaminergic (reward) signaling may mediate risks. Associations between cannabis use and offspring DNA methylation have not been investigated; however, maternal tobacco smoking in pregnancy is associated with distinct patterns of DNA methylation at birth and beyond. Objectives: To determine whether maternal cannabis use is associated with methylation of the dopamine receptor gene DRD4 promoter in infants. Methods: Mothers in the Triple B study provided detailed information on drug use in each trimester of pregnancy. Buccal swabs were collected from neonates at 8 weeks (n = 804, 51.7% male, and 48.3% female). DRD4 promoter DNA methylation was measured using SEQUENOM MassARRAY. Results: Fifty-seven of the women in the study reported drug use during pregnancy, of whom 44 used cannabis. Of 19 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) units tested in DRD4, gestational cannabis use was associated with offspring methylation at 1 CpG unit in multivariate models (β + 1.48, CI: 0.02 to 2.93, and p = 0.047). At another site there was weak evidence that both cannabis and other drug use were independently associated with increased methylation, while the association with tobacco was in the reverse direction (cannabis use β + 0.67, CI: −0.12 to 1.46, and p = 0.09; other drug use β + 1.11, CI: 0.17 to 2.05, and p = 0.02; tobacco use β −0.41, CI: −0.85 to 0.03, and p = 0.07). None of the associations would remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Conclusion: There is no strong evidence that maternal cannabis use in pregnancy is associated with offspring DRD4 methylation. © 2017 the Author(s).

As an alternative approach, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals recorded non-invasively from the brain have been utilized to decode the LMIs of humans. However, most of the existing EEG based limb movement decoding methods primarily focus on identifying limited classes of upper limb movements. In addition, investigation on EEG feature extraction methods for the decoding of multiple classes of LMIs has rarely been considered. Therefore, 32 EEG feature extraction methods (including 12 spectral domain descriptors (SDDs) and 20 time domain descriptors (TDDs)) were used to decode multiple classes of motor imagery patterns associated with different upper limb movements based on 64-channel EEG recordings. From the obtained experimental results, the best individual TDD achieved an accuracy of 67.05 ± 3.12% as against 87.03 ± 2.26% for the best SDD. By applying a linear feature combination technique, an optimal set of combined TDDs recorded an average accuracy of 90.68% while that of the SDDs achieved an accuracy of 99.55% which were significantly higher than those of the individual TDD and SDD at p < 0.05. Our findings suggest that optimal feature set combination would yield a relatively high decoding accuracy that may improve the clinical robustness of MDoF neuroprosthesis.

Such turbo-gears are API 613 compliant (Titled as -Special Purpose Gear Units for Petroleum, Chemical, and Gas Industry Services) and have horizontal offset transmission line, with journal bearings on the high speed shaft and low speed shaft. When a full load full speed complete unit test is carried out, pinion dynamic behaviour is found to be different than what observed during full speed no load condition as mandated in API 613. During this test, gear box high speed pinion may show up with high vibration or combination of both during certain load and speed combination in spite of proper balancing and alignment. Since full load full speed test is kept as an option in API 613 , hence these type of vibration may not be detected during a no load test in gear box manufacturer's premises. These types of vibration patterns are not explicitly addressed in API 613. The first objective of this paper is to cover analytical, design and diagnostic aspects which can be helpful to mitigate above issues before it is towed out from manufacturer's premises. The second objective of the paper is to suggest installation /innovation / design modification on high speed pinion as a pre-emptive approach which can save time to mitigate if encountered during any certain speed -load combination. © 2018 COMADEM International.

Instead, channel reciprocity can be utilized in time division duplex (TDD) systems so that the downlink channel estimates can be based on pilots transmitted during the uplink. User mobility affects the reciprocity and makes the channel state information outdated for high velocities and/or long downlink subframe durations. Channel extrapolation, e.g. through Kalman prediction, can reduce the problem but is also limited by high velocities and long downlink subframes. An alternative solution has been proposed where channel predictions are made with the help of an extra antenna, e.g. on the roof of a car, so called predictor antenna, with the primary objective to measure the channel at a position that is later encountered by the rearward antenna(s). The predictor antenna is not directly limited by high velocities and allows the channel in the downlinks to be interpolated rather than extrapolated. One remaining challenge here is to obtain a good interpolation of the uplink channel estimate, since a sequence of uplink reference signals (pilots) will be interrupted by downlink subframes. We here evaluate a Kalman smoothing estimate of the downlink channels and compare it to a cubic spline interpolation. These results are also compared to results where uplink channels are estimated through Kalman filters and predictors. Results are based on measured channels and show that with Kalman smoothing, predictor antennas can enable accurate channel estimates for a longer downlink period at vehicular velocities. The gaps in the uplink pilot stream, due to downlink subframes, can have durations that correspond to a vehicle movement of up to 0.75 carrier wavelengths in space, for Rayleigh-like non-line-of-sight fading. © 2018 IEEE.","","Antennas; Channel capacity; Directional patterns (antenna); Extrapolation; Fading (radio); Interpolation; Radio communication; Time division multiplexing; Velocity; Alternative solutions; Carrier wavelength; Channel prediction; Channel reciprocity; Cubic-spline interpolation; Multi-antenna systems; Time-division duplex systems; Vehicular velocity; Channel state information","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060554329"

Existing techniques mainly focus on detecting data race bugs with pattern analysis; however, the number of interleaving patterns could be huge, only the most suspicious write-read pattern is given, and an oracle is needed, which is not available in the operational phase. This paper proposes a program-invariant-based technique to detect a class of concurrent program bugs. By unit testing of the components of a concurrent program, we obtain a set of program invariants, which can be used as an oracle to obtain ""bad"" invariants when the program is online. By using the function call graph of the components and applying a reduction technique to the invariants, we find the candidates of suspicious functions and rank them. From the interactions among components, we analyze the causes to the concurrency bugs. Experimental results show that our proposed technique is effective in concurrency bug detection. © 2017 IEEE.","Bug detection; Concurrent program; Function call graph; Program invariants; Suspicious rate","Software testing; Concurrency bugs; Concurrent program; Debugging process; Function-call graphs; Operational phase; Pattern analysis; Program invariants; Reduction techniques; Program debugging","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017092217"

We adopt a centralized scheduling scheme that selects a number of active pairs in each time-slot. We consider that the transmitters apply interference alignment (IA) technique if two or more pairs are active, whereas in the special case where one pair is active point-to-point MIMO singular value decomposition (SVD) is used. We consider a time-division duplex (TDD) system where transmitters acquire their channel state information (CSI) by decoding the pilot sequences sent by the receivers. Since global CSI knowledge is required for IA, the transmitters have also to exchange their estimated CSIs over a backhaul of limited capacity (i.e. imperfect case). Under this setting, we characterize in this paper the stability region of the system under both the imperfect and perfect (i.e. unlimited backhaul) cases, then we examine the gap between these two resulting regions. Further, under each case we provide a centralized probing policy that achieves the max stability region. These stability regions and scheduling policies are given for the symmetric system, where all the path loss coefficients are equal to each other, as well as for the general system. For the symmetric system, we provide the conditions under which IA yields a queueing stability gain compared to SVD. Under the general system, the adopted scheduling policy is of a high computational complexity for moderate numbers of pairs, consequently we propose an approximate policy that has a reduced complexity but that achieves only a fraction of the system stability region. A characterization of this fraction is provided. © 2017 IEEE.","","Channel state information; Complex networks; Convergence of numerical methods; Knowledge management; MIMO systems; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Scheduling; Singular value decomposition; System stability; Transmitters; Wave interference; Wireless networks; Centralized scheduling; Dynamic traffic patterns; Interference alignment; MIMO channel; Path loss coefficients; queueing; Queueing analysis; Time-division duplex systems; Stability criteria","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029143716"

Appropriate gas-flow management realized by our homemade HVPE system permitted the growth of a GaN layer with a smooth as-grown surface and excellent thickness uniformity on the front surfaces of 4- or 6-inch patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs). However, when the grown thickness exceeded 20 μm, single-side HVPE-growth induced fractures in GaN crystals. The fracture resistance of the GaN increased markedly when it was in a cleavage-resistant polycrystalline form (poly-GaN), permitting its growth to a thickness of 100 μm. In the presence of a back-side poly-GaN layer, extremely thick GaN crystal layers could be grown on the front side without fractures.

Our approach is to use code coverage to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the tests with respect to the code elements of the program, and use this information to identify highly correlated groups of tests and code elements (using community detection algorithm). This grouping is then compared to the trivial grouping determined by package structure, and any discrepancies found are treated as 'bad smells.'

By providing large number of service antennas closer to the MUs, the cell-free massive MIMO can offer great spectral efficiency, better macro-diversity and minimal path loss. Despite several advantages, the cell-free massive MIMO suffers from energy overloading caused by uncontrolled backhaul power consumption for large number of distributed access points (APs) and pilot contamination during channel estimation. In this paper, we have taken into consideration a cell-free massive MIMO system with APs equipped with multiple antennas performing time-division-duplex (TDD) operation. Here, all the APs coordinate through a constrained backhaul network for joint transmission of signals to all the users simultaneously by multiplying the received signal with the normalized conjugate of the estimated channel state information (CSI) and send back a rounded off version of the weighted pattern to the central processing unit (CPU). Finally, an effective user defined algorithm is presented involving selection and grouping of various APs based on their individual contributions for a particular MU to improve the overall performance of the system. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Cell-free massive MIMO system; Distributed access points; Energy efficiency; Pilot contamination; Power control","Antennas; Cells; Channel estimation; Channel state information; Communication channels (information theory); Cytology; Energy efficiency; MIMO systems; Program processors; Access points; Estimated channels; Joint transmissions; Massive MIMO systems; Performance optimizations; Pilot contaminations; Spectral efficiencies; Time division duplex operations; Power control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055138449"

Similar to design patterns, patterns for unit testing promote maintainability quality attributes such as ease of diagnoses, modifiability, and comprehension. In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale study on the usage of four xUnit testing patterns which can be used to satisfy these maintainability attributes. This is a first-of-its-kind study which developed automated techniques to investigate these issues across 82,447 open source projects, and the findings provide more insight into testing practices in open source projects. Our results indicate that only 17% of projects had test cases, and from the 251 testing frameworks we studied, 93 of them were being used. We found 24% of projects with test files implemented patterns that could help with maintainability, while the remaining did not use these patterns. Multiple qualitative analyses indicate that usage of patterns was an ad-hoc decision by individual developers, rather than motivated by the characteristics of the project, and that developers sometimes used alternative techniques to address maintainability concerns. © 2017 IEEE.","Maintenance; Mining Software Repositories; Open Source; Unit Test Frameworks; Unit Test Patterns; Unit Testing","Maintainability; Maintenance; Open source software; Open systems; Testing; Automated techniques; Distributed development environments; Mining software repositories; Open source projects; Open sources; Qualitative analysis; Unit testing; Unit tests; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026510051"

Multiple-modulation of epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) is used to achieve high-quality GaN template on a novel serpentine channel patterned sapphire substrate (SCPSS). The dislocation blocking brought by the serpentine channel patterned mask, coupled with repeated dislocation bending, can reduce the dislocation density to a yet-to-be-optimized level of ∼2 × 105 to 2 × 106 cm-2. About 80% area utilization rate of GaN with low TDD and stress relaxation is obtained. The periodical variations of dislocation density, optical properties and residual stress in GaN-based epilayers on SCPSS are analyzed. The quantum efficiency of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on it can be increased by 52% compared with the conventional sapphire substrate. The reduced nonradiative recombination centers, the enhanced carrier localization, and the suppressed quantum confined Stark effect, are the main determinants of improved luminous performance in MQWs on SCPSS. This developed ELOG on serpentine shaped mask needs no interruption and regrowth, which can be a promising candidate for the heteroepitaxy of semipolar/nonpolar GaN and GaAs with high quality. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","dislocation reduction; epitaxial lateral overgrowth; GaN; InGaN quantum well; MOCVD; serpentine channel mask","Defect density; Epilayers; Epitaxial growth; Gallium alloys; Gallium nitride; Metallorganic chemical vapor deposition; Optical properties; Sapphire; Semiconducting indium compounds; Serpentine; Silicate minerals; Stress relaxation; Dislocation reduction; Epitaxial lateral overgrowth; InGaN quantum wells; Nonradiative recombination centers; Patterned sapphire substrate; Quantum confined stark effect; Serpentine channel; Threading dislocation densities; Semiconductor quantum wells","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983516263"

We need checklists and mechanisms that provide identification and knowledge of best practices to maintain consistency in performing testing activities. We propose a test patterns-based technique which supports identification of test cases on the bases of specification and domain analysis of system under test.

Many policies and programs have been implemented at local, state, and national levels in an attempt to decrease prescription opioid addiction and overdose. On August 1, 2014, Colorado Medicaid implemented a policy change that limited the quantity of short-acting opioids (SAOs) that could be filled through the Medicaid benefit to no more than 4 tablets per day, or 120 tablets in 30 days. OBJECTIVE: To compare mean total daily dose (TDD) of opioids purchased by Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) Medicaid patients before and after implementation of the Medicaid SAO quantity limit. METHODS: This investigation used a pre/post study design to compare opioid use in Medicaid-eligible patients during the 90 days before implementation of the Medicaid quantity limit on August 1, 2014, and 90 days after full implementation of the change on December 31, 2014. The study was conducted at KPCO, an integrated care delivery system providing medical care for approximately 615,000 patients, of which over 54,000 are Medicaid members. Electronic medical and pharmacy records were used to identify patients and assess medication use. RESULTS: There was a small difference in opioid use in the population of Medicaid opioid users as evidenced by the median TDD of oral morphine equivalents (OME) purchased decreasing from 6.8 mg (IQR = 2.2-25.8) in the pre-implementation period to 6.6 mg (IQR = 1.7-24.0) in the postimplementation period (P = 0.027). The proportion of patients purchasing more than 120 mg OME per day and the proportion of patients purchasing long-acting opioids (LAOs) did not change significantly from the pre- to postimplementation period (OME > 120 of 4.2% vs. 3.6%, respectively, P = 0.290; LAO use of 12.9% vs. 13.6%, respectively, P = 0.465). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a statistically significant 3% decrease of 0.2 mg OME per day in the primary study population. A 24% reduction of 10 mg OME per day before and after implementation of the Medicaid SAO quantity limit was found in those patients identified as exceeding the Medicaid SAO quantity limit at baseline. These patients tended to be purchasing low to moderate total daily doses of opioids at baseline.","","Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Colorado; Drug Overdose; Female; Humans; Male; Medicaid; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pain Management; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prescription Drug Misuse; United States; narcotic analgesic agent; adult; analgesia; clinical practice; Colorado; drug overdose; female; human; male; medicaid; Opioid-Related Disorders; Prescription Drug Misuse; procedures; United States","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013977283"

The proposed approach relies on a flexible service-oriented slicing considering diverse applications with heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) demands in terms of throughput, latency, etc. It introduces a separate and customized Uplink-Downlink (UL-DL) pattern per slice taking into account the desired Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is mapped on to a QoS policy for facilitating slicing of the radio access resources. Such a QoS policy allows the flexible allocation of Resource Blocks (RBs) considering the entire spectrum for individual services, while a dynamic resource variation additionally allocates temporarily unused RBs to particular slices in need. The end-to-end system aspects considering the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network orchestration and management architecture are also discussed and an exhaustive simulation campaign is conducted to validate our proposals against the current state- of-the-art. © 2018 IEEE.","","5G mobile communication systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Time division multiplexing; 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP); Diverse applications; End-to-end systems; Exhaustive simulation; Flexible allocations; Management architectures; Service Level Agreements; Time division duplex; Quality of service","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063449389"

Re-Du-Ning inhalation solution (RIS) is an aerosol derivative from the Re-Du-Ning injection and has been clinically used to treat respiratory diseases like pneumonia for more than twenty years in China. However, the aerosolization and inhalation performances of RIS using different nebulizers have not been characterized, which may affect the therapeutic effects of RIS on respiratory diseases. We investigated the inhalation performances of RIS using five different nebulizers utilizing Spraytec, breath simulator of BRS 2000 and NGI techniques. We tested 5 different types of jet nebulizer, using RIS and an adult breathing pattern, to determine the difference in aerosol delivery over time. The particle size distribution of RIS was monitored by a Spraytec laser particle sizer. Fine particle fraction (FPF) and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) for RIS were measured using NGI. Aerosol deposited on the filter was analysed using HPLC. Nebulization time was much longer for the Pari Boy SX (red) nebulizer than for the other nebulizers, with the minimum delivery rate (DR) and the maximum total delivered dose (TDD) and total exhalation dose (TED). Nebulization time for Pari Boy SX (blue) was the lowest, with the highest DR and the lowest TDD and TED. Furthermore, the aerodynamic particle size of RIS was much larger for the Pari blue and Pari LC Plus than other nebulizers. Pari red produced the smallest aerodynamic particle size of RIS in these five nebulizers. In addition, a good linear relationship was found between MMAD and D50 in these five nebulizers. The results demonstrated that Pari Boy SX (red) delivered most slowly and produced the smallest aerodynamic particle size of the RIS aerosols, which may be applied to manage lower respiratory diseases. Moreover, Pari LC Plus and Pari Boy SX (blue) emitted quickly and generated larger aerodynamic particle size of RIS aerosols, which could be used to treat upper respiratory diseases. A good linear relationship between MMAD and D50 showed Spraytec could be a reliable technique for the development, evaluation and quality control of aerosol particles of inhalation solution preparations. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Aerodynamics; Aerosols; Disease control; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Pulmonary diseases; Quality control; Respiratory therapy; Aerodynamic particles; Breathing patterns; Fine particle fractions; Inhalation therapy; Linear relationships; Mass median aerodynamic diameters; Solution preparations; Therapeutic effects; Interlocking signals","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072750685"

As commonly applied coverage criteria like branch coverage are potentially weak, mutation testing has been proposed as a stronger criterion. However, mutation based test generation is hampered because usually there are simply too many mutants, and too many of these are either trivially killed or equivalent. On such mutants, any effort spent on test generation would per definition be wasted. To overcome this problem, our search-based EvoSuite test generation tool integrates two novel optimizations: First, we avoid redundant test executions on mutants by monitoring state infection conditions, and second we use whole test suite generation to optimize test suites towards killing the highest number of mutants, rather than selecting individual mutants. These optimizations allowed us to apply EvoSuite to a random sample of 100 open source projects, consisting of a total of 8,963 classes and more than two million lines of code, leading to a total of 1,380,302 mutants. The experiment demonstrates that our approach scales well, making mutation testing a viable test criterion for automated test case generation tools, and allowing us to analyze the relationship of branch coverage and mutation testing in detail. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Mutation testing; Search-based testing; Test case generation; Testing classes; Unit testing","Automatic test pattern generation; Open source software; Open systems; Mutation testing; Search-based testing; Test case generation; Testing class; Unit testing; Software testing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929522239"

Each instrument has its own control unit. The Instrument Command and Data Processing Unit (VI-CDPU) is the control unit of the VIS instrument. The VI-CDPU is connected directly to the spacecraft by means of a MIL-STD-1553B bus and to the satellite Mass Memory Unit via a SpaceWire link. All the internal interfaces are implemented via SpaceWire links and include 12 high speed lines for the data provided by the 36 focal plane CCDs readout electronics (ROEs) and one link to the Power and Mechanisms Control Unit (VI-PMCU). VI-CDPU is in charge of distributing commands to the instrument sub-systems, collecting their housekeeping parameters and monitoring their health status. Moreover, the unit has the task of acquiring, reordering, compressing and transferring the science data to the satellite Mass Memory. This last feature is probably the most challenging one for the VI-CDPU, since stringent constraints about the minimum lossless compression ratio, the maximum time for the compression execution and the maximum power consumption have to be satisfied. Therefore, an accurate performance analysis at hardware layer is necessary, which could delay too much the design and development of software. In order to mitigate this risk, in the multilayered design of software we decided to design a middleware layer that provides a set of APIs with the aim of hiding the implementation of the HW connected layer to the application one. The middleware is built on top of the Operating System layer (which includes the Real-Time OS that will be adopted) and the onboard Computer Hardware. The middleware itself has a multi-layer architecture composed of 4 layers: the Abstract RTOS Adapter Layer (AOSAL), the Speci-c RTOS Adapter Layer (SOSAL), the Common Patterns Layer (CPL), the Service Layer composed of two subgroups which are the Common Service (CSL) and the Specific Service layer (SSL). The middleware design is made using the UML 2.0 standard. The AOSAL includes the abstraction of services provided by a generic RTOS (e.g Thread/Task, Time Management, Mutex and Semaphores) as well as an abstraction of SpaceWire and 1553-B bus Interface. The SOSAL is the implementation of AOSAL for the adopted RTOS. The CPL provides a set of patterns that are a general solution for common problems related to embedded hard Real Time systems. This set includes patterns for memory management, homogenous redundancy channels, pipes and filters for data exchange, proxies for slow memories, watchdog and reactive objects. The CPL is designed using a soft-metamodeling approach, so as to be as general as possible. Finally, the SL provides a set of services that are common to space applications. The testing of this middleware can be done both during the design using appropriate tools of analysis and in the implementation phase by means of unit testing tools. © 2014 SPIE.","Command Data Processing Unit (CDPU); Design Patterns; Euclid; Middleware; Model-Driven Engineering; Realtime Applications; UML; VISible imaging instrument (VIS)","Abstracting; Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Astronomy; Electronic data interchange; Hardware; Interactive computer systems; Middleware; Real time systems; Space applications; Data processing units; Design Patterns; Euclid; Model-driven Engineering; Real-time application; UML; Visible imaging; Software design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84906920527"

High performance computing (HPC) applications and libraries must exploit increasingly finer levels of parallelism within their codes to sustain scalability on these devices. A major obstacle to performance portability is the diverse and conflicting set of constraints on memory access patterns across devices. Contemporary portable programming models address manycore parallelism (e.g., OpenMP, OpenACC, OpenCL) but fail to address memory access patterns. The Kokkos C++ library enables applications and domain libraries to achieve performance portability on diverse manycore architectures by unifying abstractions for both fine-grain data parallelism and memory access patterns. In this paper we describe Kokkos' abstractions, summarize its application programmer interface (API), present performance results for unit-test kernels and mini-applications, and outline an incremental strategy for migrating legacy C++ codes to Kokkos. The Kokkos library is under active research and development to incorporate capabilities from new generations of manycore architectures, and to address a growing list of applications and domain libraries. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","GPU; Manycore; Mini-application; Multidimensional array; Parallel computing; Performance portability; Thread parallelism","GPU; Many-core; Mini applications; Multidimensional arrays; Performance portability; Thread parallelism; Parallel processing systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84910092965"

This approach is inspired by common practices in the software engineering industry in which continuous integration is widely-used for quality assurance purposes. The objective of this paper is to present a similar approach for knowledge base population and publishing. The proposed approach consists of two main steps: (i) exploratory testing, and (ii) fine-grained analysis. In the exploratory testing step, the knowledge base is tested for patterns that may reveal erroneous data or outliers that could indicate inaccuracies. This phase is knowledge-base agnostic and provides inputs for the second phase. In the finegrained analysis step, specific tests are developed for a particular knowledge base according to the data model and pre-defined constraints that shape the data. More precisely, a set of predefined queries are executed and their results are compared to the expected answers (similar to unit testing in software engineering) in order to automatically validate that the knowledge base fulfills a set of requirements. The main objective of this approach is to detect and to flag potential defects as early as possible in the data publishing process and to eliminate or minimize the undesirable outcomes in the applications that depend on the knowledge base, typically, user interfaces that enable to explore the data but rely on a particular shape of the data. This two-fold approach proves to be critical when the knowledge base is continuously evolving, not necessarily in a monotonic way, and when real-world applications highly depend on it such as the 3cixty multi-device application.","Continuous integration; Data quality; Data validation; Dynamic knowledge base","Data mining; Quality assurance; Semantic Web; Software engineering; Software testing; User interfaces; Continuous integrations; Data quality; Data validation; Dynamic knowledge base; Erroneous datum; Exploratory testing; Fine-grained analysis; Potential defects; Knowledge based systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977569389"

However, a key issue in these systems is range: mmW signals are extremely vulnerable to shadowing and poor high-frequency propagation. Multi-hop relaying is therefore a natural technology for such systems to improve cell range and cell edge rates without the addition of wired access points. This paper studies the problem of scheduling for a simple infrastructure cellular relay system where communication between wired base stations and User Equipment follow a hierarchical tree structure through fixed relay nodes. Such a systems builds naturally on existing cellular mmW backhaul by adding mmW in the access links. A key feature of the proposed system is that TDD duplexing selections can be made on a link-by-link basis due to directional isolation from other links. We devise an efficient, greedy algorithm for centralized scheduling that maximizes network utility by jointly optimizing the duplexing schedule and resources allocation for dense, relay-enhanced OFDMA/TDD mmW networks. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adapt to loading, channel conditions and traffic demands. Significant throughput gains and improved resource utilization offered by our algorithm over the static, globally-synchronized TDD patterns are demonstrated through simulations based on empirically-derived channel models at 28 GHz. © 2015 IEEE.","","Antenna arrays; Cellular radio systems; Microwave antennas; Millimeter waves; Mobile telecommunication systems; Scheduling; Trees (mathematics); Wireless networks; Centralized scheduling; Channel conditions; Greedy algorithms; Hierarchical tree; High frequency propagation; Millimeter wave (MMW); Resource utilizations; Resources allocation; Frequency division multiple access","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947810526"

Performance engineering methods may be integrated into all phases of the software lifecycle, from the conception of a system to requirements specification, architecture, testing, and finally to production. Performance expectations can be managed by carefully specifying performance requirements. Reviewing the architecture of a system before design and implementation take place reduces the risk of designing a system that contains inherent performance vice. Performance modeling can be used to justify architectural and design decisions and to plan performance tests. The outputs of such performance tests enable us able to identify concurrent programming and other issues that would not be apparent in unit testing.

Most prior work on massive MIMO considers TDD operation that relies on channel reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels, whereas most current cellular systems adopt FDD without channel reciprocity. In an FDD mode, downlink channel estimation becomes a challenging issue due to the substantial training overhead that scales with the number of antennas, which can limit the potential gain of massive MIMO systems. To tackle the issue of channel estimation, we consider the design of a training codebook that has a suitable mapping for the training signal patterns in block transmissions under the assumption of a Kaiman filtering framework. We focus on a reduced dimensionality training codebook and transmit precoding design to enable low-complexity system configuration. We discuss how this framework can extend to hybrid analog-digital precoding using a limited number of active RF chains for transmit beamforming by applying the Toeplitz distribution theorem to large-scale linear antenna arrays. A practical guideline for training codebook parameters is presented, and numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","","Antenna arrays; Antennas; Beam forming networks; Channel estimation; Design; Energy efficiency; Mobile security; Block transmissions; Channel reciprocity; Linear antenna arrays; Massive multiple-input- multiple-output system (MIMO); Practical guidelines; System configurations; Transmit beamforming; Transmit precoding; MIMO systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949922829"

The PDMS micropillars were first constructed by casting PDMS on the computer numerical control-machined cylindrical microwells, which then went through etching process to obtain the MNs for subsequent fabrication of polymer MNs or high aspect ratio micropillars. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.","","Aspect ratio; Computer control systems; Controlled drug delivery; Fabrication; Microchannels; Needles; Targeted drug delivery; 3D microstructures; Computer numerical control; Etching process; High aspect ratio; Micro-pillars; Microneedle arrays; Tissue damage; Transdermal drug delivery; Wet etching","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946595471"

Methods: A 6-cm3 ionization chamber was placed at 5-cm intervals of 225 locations in a 70 × 70 cm2 x-ray beam field. The chamber was placed at a level of 30 cm above the x-ray table to measure the air kerma intensity of the x-ray output across the whole area. Three different brands of radiographic units with different anode target angles and at different tube aging stages were studied. The same exposure parameters were used for each location, and measurements were made for three different tube potentials at 60, 85, and 110 kilovoltage peaks (kV[p]). Results: At the tube potential of 85 kV(p), the relative maximum percentage differences on the average air kerma measured along the central anode-cathode axis (x-axis) of the x-ray tube were found to be 31.5%, 15.5%, and 43.1% more at the cathode ends than those at the anode ends of the three radiographic units. Results of a paired samples t test (confidence intervals at 95%, two-tailed) on three of the four fixed pair-wise sampling points along the x-axis were found to be statistically significant in their relative percentage differences in air kerma intensity with respect to the central point (labeled as 35 cm) with a P value ≤.03. However, those measured at four fixed pair-wise points at 90° across the anode-cathode direction were all found to be statistically nonsignificant (P ≥ .29). Similar trends were observed for the other two tube potentials tested. From the three-dimensional displays of radiation output intensity, a similar unique pyramidal shape pattern with a skewed peak toward the cathode end was observed for all three diagnostic x-ray tubes tested. Conclusions: The anode heel effect was found to be enhanced in the x-ray tube with a smaller anode target angle, more aging, and higher tube potentials. Three-dimensional air kerma distribution maps of the three x-ray units tested were found to be similar in pattern, and this was displayed in detail regarding the extent of the anode heel effect. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, the more compact the frequency reuse patterns, the more severe the co-channel interference (CCI), which affects the network performance significantly. In this paper, according to Specification IEEE 802.16j/m, based on the downlink radio resource management, a proper resource reuse scheme and multi-hop relay downlink sub-frame were designed to deal with the inter-cell interference and guarantee the efficient utilization of resources in networks. The efficient PF algorithm was applied in MRCNs to take into account both the overall system performance and fairness of users.

It is increasingly clear that tumor growth depends on both internal tumor factors, and factors that are external to tumor, such as microenvironment. We recently showed that parameter values alone are less important than patterns of all patient parameters toger for identification of prognostic subtypes and have identified a network phenotyping strategy method to quantitatively describe dependency of tumor on environment, to characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtypes. We have also shown that information about tumor mass toger with patterns of or prognostic factors is related to survival. We now use a different patient cohort to validate this prognostic approach. A main finding is our identification of a common time of total disease duration (TDD) for every HCC patient. Clinical prognosis at time of baseline patient evaluation is n calculable as difference between TDD and time from disease onset to diagnosis (Tonset). We show that total pattern of all parameter values and differences in relationships between this pattern and a reference pattern that, toger with tumor mass, best reflects patient's prognosis at baseline.

It produces directional BF by adjusting the weighted coefficient of each array element to obtain obvious array gain. At present, the most common BF algorithms are eigen-based Beamfirming (EBB) algorithm and grid of beam (GOB) algorithm, but these two algorithms still have some defects. Therefore, this paper thoroughly illustrates EBB and GOB algorithms and respectively presents the corresponding improvements. On the one hand, this article proposes a modified EBB algorithm which only adaptively changes phase pattern to reduce the impact on the amplitude of the original signal, thus decreases the power loss. On the other hand, this paper puts forward an improved GOB algorithm which adds the correlation factors of the antennas with different polarization at the same physical position to increase BF gain. The performances of improved and original BF algorithms are simulated in a platform of TD-LTE. The simulation result shows that BLER performances of two enhanced BF algorithms are better than corresponding traditional algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.","BF; EBB; GOB; LTE; TDD","Beamforming; Ubiquitous computing; Array elements; Beamforming algorithms; Correlation factors; Directional signals; Original signal; Phase patterns; Signal processing technique; Weighted coefficients; Beam forming networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925252196"

As a result, developers write tests and execute them after making changes. However, high quality tests are needed that can reveal unintended bugs, and not all developers have access to such tests. Moreover, since tests are written without the knowledge of future changes, sometimes new tests are needed to exercise such changes. While this problem has been well studied in the literature, the current approaches for automatically generating such tests either only attempt to reach the change and do not aim to propagate the infected state to the output, or may suffer from scalability issues, especially when a large sequence of calls is required for propagation. We propose a search-based approach that aims to automatically generate tests which can reveal functionality changes, given two versions of a program (e.g., pre-change and post-change). Developers can then use these tests to identify unintended functionality changes (i.e., bugs). Initial evaluation results show that our approach can be effective on detecting such changes, but there remain challenges in scaling up test generation and making the tests useful to developers, both of which we aim to overcome. © 2015 ACM.","Automated unit test generation; Genetic algorithms; Regression testing; Search-based testing","Automatic test pattern generation; Genetic algorithms; Software engineering; Automated units; Evaluation results; High Quality Test; Regression testing; Scalability issue; Search-based testing; Software program; Test generations; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960351014"

In order to ease the acquisition of such test cases, automatic methods can be used. This paper introduces such an approach to unit testing of ontologies using subgroup discovery methods. The tests are given by small ontologies, which will be compared to an existing ontology. The generation of the test ontologies uses subgroup discovery methods to derive concepts and relations from real data which refers to the ontology. For each concept of the ontology, we apply subgroup discovery in order to identify subgroup patterns consisting of concepts that are (un-) correlated with the target concept. Then, subgroups with very high (or low) confidence will be selected for the testing ontology. We exemplify the approach using real-world data from the ophthalmology domain, and present first results and experiences of a case study demonstrating the test case generation process.

The pattern was produced by an inductively coupled plasma etch using a self-assembled monolayer of silica spheres on AlN as the lithographic mask. The resulting uniform 1 μm length rod structure across a wafer showed a massive reduction in threading dislocations (TDs) when annealed at 1100 °C. Overgrowing homoepitaxial AlN on top of the nanorods, at a temperature of 1100 °C, produced a crack free coalesced film with approximately 4 μm of growth, which is formed at a much lower temperature compared to that typically required for microscale ELOG. The improved crystal quality, in terms of TD reduction, of the AlN above the rods was determined by detailed weak beam (WB) electron microscopy studies and showed that the threading dislocation density (TDD) was greatly reduced, by approximately two orders of magnitude in the case for edge-type dislocations. In situ reflectance measurements during the overgrowth allowed for thickness coalescence to be estimated along with wafer curvature changes. The in situ measurements also confirmed that tensile strain built up at a much slower rate in the ELOG AlN layer compared to that of AlN prepared directly on sapphire.

Nowadays, systems typically consist of multiple interacting components and, due to their complexity, testing presents a considerable portion of the effort and cost in the design process. Exploiting the compositional structure of system specifications can considerably reduce the effort in model-based testing. Moreover, inferring properties about the system from testing its individual components allows the designer to reduce the amount of integration testing. In this paper, we study compositional properties of the ioco-testing theory. We propose a new approach to composition and hiding operations, inspired by contract-based design and interface theories. These operations preserve behaviors that are compatible under composition and hiding, and prune away incompatible ones. The resulting specification characterizes the input sequences for which the unit testing of components is sufficient to infer the correctness of component integration without the need for further tests. We provide a methodology that uses these results to minimize integration testing effort, but also to detect potential weaknesses in specifications. While we focus on asynchronous models and the ioco conformance relation, the resulting methodology can be applied to a broader class of systems. © 2014 IEEE.","compositional testing; model-based testing","Automatic test pattern generation; Integration testing; Specifications; Component integration; Compositional properties; Compositional specifications; Compositional structure; Contract-based designs; High level specification; Model based testing; Software and hardware testing; Black-box testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903127477"

First, a stripe pattern parallel to the a-axis of Al2O3 was formed on an as-received c -sapphire wafer and then a second stripe pattern rotated around 3° from the m-axis of Al2O3 was formed on the first stripe PSS. The light output power of TPSS LEDs was around 1.25 times higher than that of LEDs on a flat sapphire substrate. This enhancement is caused by the increase of both the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and the LEE. On the other hand, although the LED on TPSS with the second stripe just parallel to the m-axis of Al2O3 showed a similar enhancement ratio of the light output power, the current leakage of this LED increased with the concentration of threading dislocations on the surface of LEDs.

The BS chooses each slot the users to be active, and serves them using Zero Forcing (ZF) precoding. This requires the knowledge of the users' channels which is assumed to be performed e.g. via uplink training. Due to the channel acquisition overhead, only a subset of users must be active at each timeslot (depending on traffic patterns and channel states). In this paper, we develop an active user selection strategy where the base station sets a given threshold for the channel gain of the users. Then, only the users that have their channel gain higher than the threshold send their training sequence and are then considered to be served. The base station estimates the channel states of these users and, due to channel reciprocity, uses these channel states to transmit data via ZF precoding. With appropriate signaling and threshold selection, which adapt to the queuing behavior of the users, we prove that our proposed method achieves a larger stability region than the baseline centralized policy where the BS selects the users based on channel statistics and queue lengths. The performance of the threshold-based method is illustrated via simulations, where we can observe a tradeoff between the expansion of the stability region and delay performance. © 2015 IEEE.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84953748659"

In this paper, we explore the relationship between production code properties (at the class level) and a set of test smells, in five open source systems. Specifically, we examine whether complexity properties of a production class can be used as predictors of the presence of test smells in the associated unit test. Our results, derived from the analysis of 975 production class-unit test pairs, show that the Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) and Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) of production classes are strong indicators of the presence of smells in their associated unit tests. The Lack of Cohesion of Methods in a production class (LCOM) also appears to be a good indicator of the presence of test smells. Perhaps more importantly, all three metrics appear to be good indicators of particular test smells, especially Eager Test and Duplicated Code. The Depth of the Inheritance Tree (DIT), on the other hand, was not found to be significantly related to the incidence of test smells. The results have important implications for large-scale software development, particularly in a context where organizations are increasingly using, adopting or adapting open source code as part of their development strategy and need to ensure that classes and methods are kept as simple as possible. © 2016 IEEE.","Empirical study; OO metrics; Software testing; Test smells","Codes (symbols); Odors; Open source software; Open systems; Software design; Testing; Cyclomatic complexity; Development strategies; Empirical studies; Inheritance tree; OO metrics; Open source system; Open-source code; Weighted method; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018507379"

In the absence of a specification, developers are expected to manually construct or verify the test oracle for each test input. Nevertheless, it is assumed that these generated tests ease the task of testing for the developer, as testing is reduced to checking the results of tests. While this assumption has persisted for decades, there has been no conclusive evidence to date confirming it. However, the limited adoption in industry indicates this assumption may not be correct, and calls into question the practical value of test generation tools. To investigate this issue, we performed two controlled experiments comparing a total of 97 subjects split between writing tests manually and writing tests with the aid of an automated unit test generation tool, EVOSUITE. We found that, on one hand, tool support leads to clear improvements in commonly applied quality metrics such as code coverage (up to 300% increase). However, on the other hand, there was no measurable improvement in the number of bugs actually found by developers. Our results not only cast some doubt on how the research community evaluates test generation tools, but also point to improvements and future work necessary before automated test generation tools will be widely adopted by practitioners. © 2015 ACM.","Automated test generation; Branch coverage; Empirical software engineering; Unit testing","Automation; Engineering research; Software testing; Automated test generations; Branch coverage; Controlled experiment; Empirical Software Engineering; Empirical studies; Research communities; Test generations; Unit testing; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941555928"

In particular, the proposed method checks for properties related to pointer safety, memory leaks, and invalid deallocation. To investigate our method’s effectiveness, we developed a tool called Map2Check that adopts the ESBMC model checker and the CUnit testing framework. Additionally, Map2Check provides an integration of BMC tools with unit testing frameworks, which helps developers not very familiar with formal methods to verify large C programs. We use Map2Check to perform an empirical evaluation over publicly available benchmarks and compare the results to recognized tools, e.g., Valgrind’s Memcheck, CBMC, LLBMC, CPA Checker, Predator, and ESBMC. Experimental results show that our proposed method detects at least as many memory management defects as existing tools; and it does not report any false positive and negative. We compared Map2Check with tools on the Competition on Software Verification 2014 (SVCOMP), in the Memory Safety category.

In the past, we have demonstrated scientific advance in automated unit test generation with the EvoSuite tool by evaluating it on manually selected open-source projects or examples that represent a particular problem addressed by the underlying technique. However, demonstrating scientific advance is not necessarily the same as demonstrating practical value; even if EvoSuite worked well on the software projects we selected for evaluation, it might not scale up to the complexity of real systems. Ideally, one would use large ""real-world"" software systems to minimize the threats to external validity when evaluating research tools. However, neither choosing such software systems nor applying research prototypes to them are trivial tasks. In this article we present the results of a large experiment in unit test generation using the EvoSuite tool on 100 randomly chosen open-source projects, the 10 most popular open-source projects according to the SourceForge Web site, seven industrial projects, and 11 automatically generated software projects. The study confirms that EvoSuite can achieve good levels of branch coverage (on average, 71% per class) in practice. However, the study also exemplifies how the choice of software systems for an empirical study can influence the results of the experiments, which can serve to inform researchers to make more conscious choices in the selection of software system subjects. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate how practical limitations interfere with scientific advances, branch coverage on an unbiased sample is affected by predominant environmental dependencies. The surprisingly large effect of such practical engineering problems in unit testing will hopefully lead to a larger appreciation of work in this area, thus supporting transfer of knowledge from software testing research to practice. © 2014 ACM.","Automated test generation; Benchmark; Branch coverage; Empirical software engineering; Java; JUnit; Unit testing","Automatic test pattern generation; Automation; Benchmarking; Engineering research; Knowledge management; Open source software; Open systems; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Software prototyping; Automated test generations; Branch coverage; Empirical Software Engineering; Java; JUnit; Unit testing; Software testing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920201232"

Current web test automation techniques target the generation of event sequences, but they ignore testing the JavaScript code at the unit level. Further they either ignore the oracle problem completely or simplify it through generic soft oracles such as HTML validation and runtime exceptions. We present a framework to automatically generate test cases for JavaScript applications at two complementary levels, namely events and individual JavaScript functions. Our approach employs a combination of function coverage maximization and function state abstraction algorithms to efficiently generate test cases. In addition, these test cases are strengthened by automatically generated mutation-based oracles. We empirically evaluate the implementation of our approach, called JSEFT, to assess its efficacy. The results, on 13 JavaScript-based applications, show that the generated test cases achieve a coverage of 68% and that JSEFT can detect injected JavaScript and DOM faults with a high accuracy (100% precision, 70% recall).

This chapter describes one such effort which distinguishes itself from the rest by considering and describing a system with true commercial potential and thus significant social impact. Promising efforts in investigating and identifying the requirements for a system of smart monitoring and adaptive lifestyle pattern detection and analysis are described. An initial proposal for a system relying on remote monitoring using persistent communications technology and a centralized data gathering, analysis and decision making is presented. During the initial development stage requirements for sensor placements, efficient sensor data formats and transmission protocols became apparent; unit testing and system validation demanded generation of large amounts of suitable sensor data. Here we also describe a simulator we developed in order to support these requirements; the rationale behind the simulator, its main functions and usage and the positive contribution it has made during the initial stages and the prototyping phases of the above system are explained. Finally a prototype developed in facilitating initial investigations is described and the vision for future developments is articulated. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Assisted living; Communications protocols; Pattern recognition; Remote sensors; Rule-based inference; Simulation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958553024"

Although transmit-side channel state information (CSI) can be obtained by employing channel reciprocity in time division duplexing (TDD) systems, explicit feedback of CSI from the user to the basestation is required for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. In this paper, we propose an antenna grouping based feedback reduction technique for FDD-based massive MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm, dubbed antenna group beamforming (AGB), groups antenna elements using pre-designed patterns. The proposed method introduces the concept of using a header of overall feedback resources to select a suitable group pattern and the payload to quantize the effective channel vector. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves significant feedback overhead reduction over conventional approach. © 2014 IEEE.","","Antennas; Base stations; Feedback; MIMO systems; Antenna groupings; Channel reciprocity; Conventional approach; Explicit feedback; Feedback overhead; Frequency division duplexing; Reduction techniques; Time division duplexing; Channel state information","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907000454"

Parameter Control automatically adapts parameters during test generation, and has shown to help solve this problem in other areas. To investigate any improvements parameter control could have in search-based generation of test suites, we adapted multiple methods of controlling mutation and crossover rate in EvoSuite, a tool that automatically generates unit test suites.

Finding a predefined pattern in a domain-specific model can be requested in MDE. This technique can help in optimizing or refactoring the models or to translate from one language to another one. The goal of the current researching is to create a framework for MDE which can find patterns defined by the users. Performance is a key issue. Using heterogeneous computation system (e.g.: CPU+GPU) is a promising way to increase the performance of the calculation. Therefore, we created a solution based on the OpenCL framework which is one of the most popular heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, the new pattern matching framework and the main steps of its creation are presented. The applied conception consists of two main steps. Firstly, a simpler case study is solved and experiences are collected from the occurring challenges. Secondly, the achieved solution was extended for general pattern matching. In both steps, the core algorithms are implemented according to the test-driven development methodology. To elaborate these steps, a new technique is provided which can be useful in creating any GPU-based model transformation and thus MDE approaches are improved in general. © 2015 IEEE.","","Information science; Intelligent systems; Pattern matching; Program processors; Software engineering; Domain specific modeling; Heterogeneous computation; Heterogeneous platforms; Model transformation; Model-driven Engineering; Software development methodologies; Software industry; Test driven development; Software design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964857551"

This is, however, a very challenging problem. Although on the large scale, the wind speed is related to atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other meteorological variables, no improvement in forecasting accuracy was found by incorporating air pressure and temperature directly into an advanced space-time statistical forecasting model, the trigonometric direction diurnal (TDD) model. This paper proposes to incorporate the geostrophic wind as a new predictor in the TDD model. The geostrophic wind captures the physical relationship between wind and pressure through the observed approximate balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis acceleration due to the Earth’s rotation. Based on our numerical experiments with data from West Texas, our new method produces more accurate forecasts than does the TDD model using air pressure and temperature for 1to 6-hour-ahead forecasts based on three different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, forecasting errors can be further reduced by using moving average hourly wind speeds to fit the diurnal pattern. For example, our new method obtains between 13.9% and 22.4% overall mean absolute error reduction relative to persistence in 2-hour-ahead forecasts, and between 5.3% and 8.2% reduction relative to the best previous space-time methods in this setting. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014.","Geostrophic wind; Space-time statistical model; Wind energy; Wind speed forecasting","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896392672"

It is a promising way to apply computations in parallel in order to meet the performance requirements. Since GPUs are designed to apply highly parallel tasks, using a CPU+GPU heterogeneous architecture has gained an increasing popularity in computation intensive applications. The paper presents a new generic GPGPU-based approach for pattern matching in graphs. The approach is part of a modeltransformation solution we are building. The solution is referred to as GPGPU-based Engine for Model Processing (GEMP). Building on top of the OpenCL framework, the computation is hardware and software platform independent in GEMP. The kernel code is generated at run-time based on the concrete pattern to be found. The generative solution allows us to optimize the code based on several aspects, e.g. the size of the pattern, the GPU device type, or the available memory. This new generic code approach is compared to a universal kernel code which can handle all kinds of patterns without any modification in the code. To verify the functional and non-functional requirements, the implementation is tested in two main steps using unit tests, and a real world case study. Evaluation of our measurements, performance and scalability results are described.

But how good are these tests at actually finding faults? To answer this question, we applied three state-of-the-art unit test generation tools for Java (Randoop, EvoSuite, and Agitar) to the 357 real faults in the Defects4J dataset and investigated how well the generated test suites perform at detecting these faults. Although the automatically generated test suites detected 55.7% of the faults overall, only 19.9% of all the individual test suites detected a fault. By studying the effectiveness and problems of the individual tools and the tests they generate, we derive insights to support the development of automated unit test generators that achieve a higher fault detection rate. These insights include 1) improving the obtained code coverage so that faulty statements are executed in the first instance, 2) improving the propagation of faulty program states to an observable output, coupled with the generation of more sensitive assertions, and 3) improving the simulation of the execution environment to detect faults that are dependent on external factors such as date and time. © 2015 IEEE.","Automated test generation; Empirical study; Regression testing; Test effectiveness; Unit testing","Automation; Fault detection; Software engineering; Software testing; Statistical tests; Automated test generations; Empirical studies; Regression testing; Test effectiveness; Unit testing; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963828697"

The proposed CoRAC scheme comprises dynamic base-band unit-remote radio unit (BBU-RRU) mapping and cooperative dynamic downlink/uplink (DL/UL) reconfiguration. Specifically, in our proposed scheme, the logical connections between BBUs and RRUs are adaptively adjusted according the the traffic condition and interference patterns. Cell clusters are correspondingly formed, on which the developed cooperative reconfiguration method is conducted. With this setup, the DL/UL configurations are no longer determined with respect to an individual cell, but are chosen in form of the cluster-specific configuration patterns (CPs) with optimized performance metrics. Our proposed CoRAC scheme is custom designed for time-division duplex (TDD) systems aiming at (1) asymmetric traffic adaptation with load balancing; and (2) cross-subframe co-channel interference (CCI) management. In addition to (1) and (2), the CoRAC is beneficial from the perspective of network energy savings. This is because by shutting down under-utilized BBUs and selecting appropriate DL/UL configurations for traffic adaptation, the power consumption of both BBUs and RRUs (in terms of per-subframe radiated transmission power) can be reduced. System level evaluation results are provided, which show that by employing our proposed scheme, remarkable performance improvements can be obtained relative to the existing methods, in terms of the packet throughput, traffic adaptation and power consumption. © 2013 IEEE.","","Resource allocation; Cochannel interference (CCI); Cooperative dynamics; Energy saving potential; Interference patterns; Optimized performance; Radio access networks; System level evaluation; Time-division duplex systems; Energy conservation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893595006"

Not only it protects the system from various exploits, but it also improves the user experience. User immediately sees what values are missing or are not valid and should be fixed. It is important to validate code on client side in the browser, but that does not mean that the validation on server side can be omitted. The golden rule of the web applications is not to trust user input and validate code on server side as well. The user input validation is therefore duplicated - it validates the input values first on client side using JavaScript before the data is sent to server and then the received data is validated again on the server side. Changes made to the validation code must be synchronized in code on both sides. All implementations must be also unit tested, multiple sets of unit tests must be created and maintained. We will describe how we extended white-box testing tool Pex to generate user input validation code for web applications created on .NET platform. The JavaScript client side validation code is generated from the controller code written in C#. The code then validates input values on the client side. Most of the testing can be automated executing generated test. Testing resources - i.e time spent on testing and number of testers involved people - are saved.

During an early development stage, the developer specifies threats and vulnerabilities in the target system, and then TESEM verifies whether the security patterns are properly applied and assesses whether these vulnerabilities are resolved. © 2015 IEEE.","Component; Model Testing; Security Patterns; Test-Driven Development; UML","Security of data; Verification; Well testing; Component; Development process; Development stages; Model testing; Security patterns; Security requirements; Test driven development; Threats and vulnerabilities; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84935039839"

This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features [31] and deep-learned features [24]. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMD-B51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features [31] and deep-learned features [24]. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets. © 2015 IEEE.","","Computer vision; Convolution; Motion estimation; Trajectories; Action recognition; Channel normalization; Constrained sampling; Deep architectures; Intrinsic characteristics; Normalization methods; Temporal dimensions; Video representations; Pattern recognition","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955282488"

It is unreasonable to expect developers to understand search algorithms well enough to find the optimal parameter settings for a problem at hand, and even if they did, a static value for a parameter can be suboptimal at any given point during the search. To counter this problem, parameter control methods have been devised to automatically determine and adapt parameter values throughout the search. To investigate whether parameter control methods can also improve search-based generation of test suites, we have implemented and evaluated different methods to control the crossover and mutation rate in the EVOSUITE unit test generation tool. Evaluation on a selection of open source Java classes reveals that while parameter control improves the values of mutation and crossover rate successfully during runtime, the positive effects of this improvement are often countered by increased costs of fitness evaluation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","Automatic test pattern generation; Open source software; Software engineering; Software testing; Testing; Crossover and mutation; Fitness evaluations; Optimal parameter settings; Parameter control; Parameter control method; Search Algorithms; Search-based testing; Unit test generations; Parameter estimation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951291034"

An extensive literature exists with the goal of facilitating the adoption of formal methods for educational and industrial practices, yet its adoption for teaching introductory software engineering courses and analyzing critical software systems in the industry is poor. The goal of this research is to provide an easy-to-use approach for using formal methods for industrial and academic purposes. Our approach is based on generating formal representations of static and dynamic abstractions of software expressed in a textual language, called Umple, which is derived from UML. To enrich the modeling experience, we adopt a pattern-based approach to specify various object-oriented and transition patterns. To maintain scalability of the dynamic aspects, we adopted a compositional approach to integrate hierarchical systems. To ensure correctness of our approach, we have adopted simulation and rigorous test-driven development methodologies. Current results have demonstrated that the constraints and generated formal methods code represent the patterns faithfully.","Automated code generation; Formal methods; Model checking; Model-driven engineering; Scalability; Software engineering","Computational linguistics; Engineering research; Hierarchical systems; Industrial research; Model checking; Object oriented programming; Scalability; Software engineering; Teaching; Automated code generation; Formal representations; Industrial practices; Initial exploration; Model-driven Engineering; Software engineering course; Test driven development; Transition patterns; Formal methods","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962212406"

The internal quality is typically enforced through testing, which in turn also affects the development and maintenance costs. This is the reason why testing methodologies have become a major concern for any company that builds - or is involved in building - software. Although there is no testing approach that suits all contexts, we infer some general guidelines learned during the Development of the Italian Single-dish COntrol System (DISCOS), which is a project aimed at producing the control software for the three INAF radio telescopes (the Medicina and Noto dishes, and the newly-built SRT). These guidelines concern both the development and the maintenance phases, and their ultimate goal is to maximize the DISCOS software quality through a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) workflow beside a continuous delivery pipeline. We consider different topics and patterns; they involve the proper apportion of the tests (from end-to-end to low-level tests), the choice between hardware simulators and mockers, why and how to apply TDD and the dependency injection to increase the test coverage, the emerging technologies available for test isolation, bug fixing, how to protect the system from the external resources changes (firmware updating, hardware substitution, etc.) and, eventually, how to accomplish BDD starting from functional tests and going through integration and unit tests. We discuss pros and cons of each solution and point out the motivations of our choices either as a general rule or narrowed in the context of the DISCOS project. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

In order to achieve the performance that massive MIMO systems promise, accurate transmit-side channel state information (CSI) should be available at the base station. While transmit-side CSI can be obtained by employing channel reciprocity in time division duplexing (TDD) systems, explicit feedback of CSI from the user terminal to the base station is needed for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. In this paper, we propose an antenna grouping based feedback reduction technique for FDD-based massive MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm, dubbed antenna group beamforming (AGB), maps multiple correlated antenna elements to a single representative value using predesigned patterns. The proposed method modifies the feedback packet by introducing the concept of a header to select a suitable group pattern and a payload to quantize the reduced dimension channel vector. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves significant feedback overhead reduction over conventional approach performing the vector quantization of whole channel vector under the same target sum rate requirement. © 2015 IEEE.","","Antennas; Base stations; Communication channels (information theory); Information retrieval; MIMO systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Vector quantization; Channel reciprocity; Conventional approach; Correlated antennas; Feedback compressions; Frequency division duplexing; Reduction techniques; Representative values; Time division duplexing; Channel state information","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941216867"

Contrasting with the current embedded engineering practices, Test-Driven Development (TDD) promotes testing software during its development, even before the target hardware becomes available. Principally, TDD promotes a fast feedback cycle in which a test is written before the implementation. Moreover, each test is added to a test suite, which runs at every step in the TDD cycle. As a consequence, test-driven code is well tested and maintainable. Still, embedded software has some typical properties which impose challenges to apply the TDD cycle. Essentially, uploading software to target is generally too time-consuming to frequently run tests on target. Secondary issues are hardware dependencies and limited resources, such as memory footprint or processing power. In order to deal with these limitations, four methods have been identified and evaluated. Furthermore, a number of relevant design patterns are discussed to apply TDD in an embedded environment. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958523962"

There is some discussion in the software engineering community on whether TDD can really be used to achieve software quality. Some experiments were conducted in the last years comparing development by using TDD with one creating tests after the production code. However, these experiments always have some threats to validity that prevent researchers from reaching a final answer about its effects. This chapter, instead of trying to prove that TDD is more effective than creating tests after, investigates projects where TDD was successfully used, and presents recurrent and common practices applied to its context. A common mistake is to believe that just by creating tests before production code will make the application design ""just happens."" As with any other technique, TDD is not a silver bullet, and while it certainly helps to achieve some desirable characteristics in software, such as decoupling and separation of concerns, other practices should complement its usage, especially for architecture and design coherence. In this chapter, we dive deep in TDD practice and how to perform it to achieve quality in software design. We also present techniques that should be used to setup a foundation to start TDD in project and to refine the design after it is applied. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, the GaN layers still contain a dislocation density of over 3×108/cm2 and stacking faults (SFs). To reduce such defects, we employed shallowly etched r-PSSs. The etching depths of the shallowly etched r-PSSs were from 100 to 500 nm, whereas that of a conventional r-PSS was 1 μm. As a result, we found that the threading dislocation density (TDD) decreases as the etching depth decreases. The TDD of the {11-22} GaN layer on r-PSS etched to a depth of 100 nm was 1.3×108/cm2. Moreover, the reduction of the SFs was observed by photoluminescence at cryogenic temperature. The reduction of the defects revealed the growth mechanism; the crystalline quality of {11-22} GaN on an r-PSS depends on the selective growth area of the sapphire sidewall. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","A1.

In addition to discovery in traditional access point-to-user equipment (AP2UE) links, there is a need to support also other link types, such as device-to-device (D2D) communication and wireless backhauling. In this paper, we provide a design for discovery patterns and groups of patterns applicable to half-duplex time division duplexing (TDD) nodes operating in a frame based system. The proposed scheme allows an easy design of discovery patterns, which can be used for comprehensive bi-directional communication where all nodes are able to listen to each other. Proposed approach provides also an upper limit for the discovery time with an assumption that discovery signal is received correctly at the receiving node. We also support network topologies containing network elements of different hierarchies which require mono-directional discovery function among network nodes, e.g. from higher towards lower hierarchy levels. © 2013 Authors.","Discovery pattern; Half-duplex; LTE; TDD","Communication; Electric network topology; Mobile telecommunication systems; Bi-directional communication; Deviceto-device (D2D) communication; Discovery pattern; Half-duplex; LTE; TDD; Time division duplexing; Wireless backhauling; Design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890020102"

However, a lot of Java’s popularity is due to its usage to develop enterprise applications with frameworks such as Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) or Spring. These frameworks pose challenges to the automatic generation of JUnit tests. In particular, code units (""beans"") are handled by external web containers (e.g., WildFly and GlassFish). Without considering how web containers initialize these beans, automatically generated unit tests would not represent valid scenarios and would be of little use. For example, common issues of bean initialization are dependency injection, database connection, and JNDI bean lookup. In this paper, we extend the EvoSuite search-based JUnit test generation tool to provide initial support for JEE applications.

It is expected that TD-LTE will be more rapidly deployed in near future and most of WiMax operators will upgrade their networks to TD-LTE gradually. Before completely upgrading to TD-LTE, WiMax may coexist with TD-LTE in an adjacent frequency band. In addition, multiple TD-LTE operators may deploy their networks in adjacent bands. When more than one TDD network operates in adjacent frequency bands, severe interference may happen due to adjacent channel interference (ACI) and unsynchronized operations. In this paper, coexistence issues between TD-LTE and other systems are analyzed and coexistence requirements are provided. This paper has three research objectives. First, frame synchronization between TD-LTE and WiMax is discussed by investigating possible combinations of TD-LTE and WiMax configurations. Second, an uplink scheduling algorithm is proposed to utilize a leakage pattern of ACI in synchronized operations. Third, minimum requirements for coexistence in unsynchronized operations are analyzed by introducing a concept of adjacent-channel coupling loss. From the analysis and simulation results, we can see that coexistence of TD-LTE with other TDD systems is feasible if the two networks are synchronized. For the unsynchronized case, some special cell-site engineering techniques may be required to reduce the ACI. © 2014 Woon-Young Yeo et al.","","Computer Communication Networks; algorithm; analytic method; article; feasibility study; long term evolution; methodology; simulation; computer network","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896378354"

Several search-based techniques have proved successful at automatically generating tests that achieve high coverage. However, despite the well-established arguments behind using evolutionary search algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms) in preference to random search, it remains an open question whether the benefits can actually be observed in practice when generating unit test suites for object-oriented classes. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the effects of using a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate test suites over generating test suites incrementally with random search, by applying the EvoSuite unit test suite generator to 1,000 classes randomly selected from the SF110 corpus of open source projects. Surprisingly, the results show little difference between the coverage achieved by test suites generated with evolutionary search compared to those generated using random search. A detailed analysis reveals that the genetic algorithm covers more branches of the type where standard fitness functions provide guidance. In practice, however, we observed that the vast majority of branches in the analyzed projects provide no such guidance. © 2015 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Automated Unit Test Generation; Genetic algorithms; Random testing; Search-based testing","Algorithms; Automatic test pattern generation; Genetic algorithms; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Software testing; Automated units; Evolutionary search; Evolutionary search algorithms; Object-oriented class; Object-oriented test suites; Open source projects; Random testing; Search-based testing; Evolutionary algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960418726"

Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consisting of low-power small cells underlying the existing macro cells represent the preferred solution to increase the capacity of cellular systems by means of spatial spectrum reuse. Static uplink/downlink time-division duplexing (TDD) configurations of existing networks cannot satisfy the varying traffic patterns of large number of small cells, which vary among cells and over time. In this paper we propose and evaluate a centralized algorithm for dynamic TDD frame configuration to which operates on a cluster-based cellular network, maximize the network throughput and preserving fairness. Our algorithm is characterized by only O(n log n) time complexity (with n cells in the network), which allows for instantaneous network-wise reconfigurations minimizing overhead. The algorithm is proven to be optimal and time efficient. Extensive simulation results using realistic application traffic have shown the superiority the proposed solution against static TDD configurations of LTE systems.

A developer would first need to know when and how to apply such a tool, and would then need to understand the resulting tests in order to provide test oracles and to diagnose and fix any faults that the tests reveal. Considering all this, does automatically generating unit tests provide any benefit over simply writing unit tests manually? We empirically investigated the effects of using an automated unit test generation tool (EVOSUITE) during development. A controlled experiment with 41 students shows that using EVOSUITE leads to an average branch coverage increase of +13%, and 36% less time is spent on testing compared to writing unit tests manually. However, there is no clear effect on the quality of the implementations, as it depends on how the test generation tool and the generated tests are used. In-depth analysis, using five think-aloud observations with professional programmers, confirms the necessity to increase the usability of automated unit test generation tools, to integrate them better during software development, and to educate software developers on how to best use those tools.

TDD dynamic UL/DL reconfiguration, under discussion in LTE Release 12, enables cells to quickly adapt the ratio of allocated UL and DL subframes to changing traffic patterns which can be different for neighboring cells. Having different UL/DL directions for the same subframe in adjacent cells can result in new destructive interference components, i.e., eNB-to-eNB and UE-to-UE, with levels that can significantly differ from one subframe to another. In this paper, UL power control mechanisms are considered to manage such interference, where different sets of UL subframes use different UL power control parameters. In particular, two schemes are studied where, in one, fixed subframe sets are chosen based on expected interference and, in the other, the eNB monitors interference levels in the subframes and dynamically reconfigures the subframe sets accordingly. The performance of each scheme is evaluated through system level simulations and it is shown that the UL power control with dynamic UL subframe set configuration outperforms the one with static UL subframe sets, with significant improvement achieved at cell edge. © 2014 IEEE.","","Cells; Cytology; Interference suppression; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optical communication; Power control; Control mechanism; Control parameters; Destructive interference; Interference level; Interference mitigation; Power control schemes; Spectrum allocation; System level simulation; Wireless telecommunication systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904157999"

However, only a few studies focus on normally hearing subjects with tinnitus complaint. Objective: to investigate normally hearing adults with tinnitus complaint by (central) auditory processing tests and otoacoustic emissions. Method: Clinical transversal study. 24 adults with ages between 20 to 45 years of age, with basic audiologic evaluation within normal limits were evaluated. They were divided into two groups: experimental, consisting of eight patients with unilateral or bilateral, constant or frequent intermittent idiopathic tinnitus and control group composed of 16 normally hearing adults without tinnitus complaint. The (central) auditory processing tests used were: speech in noise, masking level difference (MLD), dichotic digits test (TDD) and pitch pattern sequence test (PPST). Transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were determined. Results: The mean score on the test speech in noise test was worse in patients with tinnitus complaint.

In particular, a common problem in modern programming languages is posed by code that involves networking (e.g., opening a TCP listening port). In order to generate tests for such code, we describe an approach where we mock (simulate) the networking interfaces of the Java standard library, such that a search-based test generator can treat the network as part of the test input space. This not only has the benefit that it overcomes many limitations of testing networking code (e.g., different tests binding to the same local ports, and deterministic resolution of hostnames and ephemeral ports), it also substantially increases code coverage. An evaluation on 23,886 classes from 110 open source projects, totalling more than 6.6 million lines of Java code, reveals that network access happens in 2,642 classes (11%). Our implementation of the proposed technique as part of the EVOSUITE testing tool addresses the networking code contained in 1,672 (63%) of these classes, and leads to an increase of the average line coverage from 29.1% to 50.8%. On a manual selection of 42 Java classes heavily depending on networking, line coverage with EVOSUITE more than doubled with the use of network mocking, increasing from 31.8% to 76.6%. © 2015 ACM.","Automated test generation; Java; Junit; Unit testing","Automation; Codes (symbols); Computer software; Open source software; Open systems; Software engineering; Software testing; Testing; Automated test generations; Automated units; External resources; Java; Junit; Open source projects; Standard libraries; Unit testing; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960344128"

Our growth technique using SiN layers makes it possible to decrease twist components (edge-type threading dislocation components). The edge-type TDDs are almost the same values as those of LEDs grown on Al2O3 (0001) substrates. EQE of LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates increases with decreasing edge-type dislocation in the low-current-density region, and the EQE of the sample with low TDD is almost as high as that of the LED grown on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate at room temperature. It is found that the hot/cold factors (HCFs) of LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates increase with decreasing edge-type dislocations in the low-current-density region, but are less than those of an LED grown on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) shows that the dominant origin of the thermal quenching is edge-type dislocations in our samples, but other defects such as screw-type dislocations also contribute to it. We also found the fluctuated emission patterns consisting of bright and dark areas originated from the difference of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type defect densities in the multi-quantum wells (MQWs) grown on Si (111) substrates. The bright areas spread, and the configurations of the bright areas change into ring-like patterns with reducing edge-type TDDs. We suggest that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of dark areas should be promoted to improve the performance of the MQWs grown on Si (111) substrates. © 2014 SPIE.","emission pattern; GaN; LEDs; photoluminescence; Si substrate; thermal quenching; threading dislocation","Aluminum; Edge dislocations; Gallium nitride; Light emitting diodes; Photoluminescence; Quenching; Screw dislocations; Semiconductor quantum wells; Silicon; Silicon nitride; Emission pattern; GaN; LEDs; Si substrates; Thermal quenching; Threading dislocation; Substrates","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901817945"

Indeed, while some studies inspected the effectiveness and the usability of these tools in practice, it is still unknown whether test code is maintainable.

The MPSS samples' surfaces consisted of a triangular grid of about 375 nm high truncated cones with different pitches of 460 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, 700 nm and 800 nm. A commercially available patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) and a flat sapphire substrate (FSS) was also used in the experiments for comparison. According to the cathode luminescence observation, the GaN template on MPSS with a thickness of 3 μm showed a threading dislocation density (TDD) of around 1.9 × 108 cm-2. Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that many of the dislocations were bent and disappeared as loops formed in the vicinity of MPSS cones. On the other hand, PSS required a GaN template thicker than 5μm to achieve a level of TDD equal to MPSS. The LED on MPSS with a pitch of 600 nm showed the highest light output power among the evaluated LEDs as it was 1.89 times higher than that on FSS and 1.05 times higher than that on PSS. The pitch dependence of the light output improvement agrees with the pitch dependence of the simulated transmissivity at the GaN/sapphire interface. As a result of our comparison, we concluded that MPSS provides the most cost effective solution for high performance LEDs. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The Test Automation Framework and Data-Driven Test patterns can provide the reuse of test logic and the automation of implementation mechanisms, reducing the effort required to test the variations of each application.

This leads to tests which are not maintainable, hard to understand and inefficient to execute. For source code and unit tests, so called code smells and test smells have been established as indicators to identify poorly written code. We apply the idea of smells to natural language tests by defining a set of common Natural Language Test Smells (NLTS).

It was not merely a change in the form of tests being used or the ways students were graded. It had more to do with students assuming much more active roles, becoming the primary workers, engaged in content issues that mattered to them; a curriculum that was flexibly organized and called upon students to actually demonstrate their understandings, with uncoverage as opposed to coverage of content assuming prominence; and teachers learning to live with more uncertainty, being willing to alter-generally slow down-their pace, accepting the fact that students might pursue different directions, different topics, possibly learn different things. The shift in patterns and responsibilities was large. What we should learn from the earlier experience is that a more productive system of assessment only makes sense if the teaching-learning exchange itself is equally powerful. Why develop, for example, portfolios of students’ work if the work students are asked to complete is primarily sets of worksheets? Why record student presentations if the presentations are on topics about which the students had little choice and have little interest? Why ask students to select “best work’' and share with their parents how they selected their work if they haven’t had the time or resources to complete work they, in fact, honor and see as important? Having a system-wide spelling list from which there will be a test each Friday, having a standard textbook with unit tests and year-end tests to prepare students for, having a predetermined set of topics to study along with a list of things every child should clearly know, leaves teachers with greater certainty and with less to invent, stay in touch with, observe, respond to. Given the organization of schools, it is not surprising that the less complex patterns of assessment, curriculum, and pedagogy remained dominant in the earlier period, even as teachers and schools here and there pursued more progressive possibilities.

Random and heuristic approaches are well known for test input data generation. Unfortunately, in the presence of complex pre-conditions especially in the case of non-primitive data types those approaches often fail. A promising technique for generating an object that exactly satisfies a given pre-condition is mocking, i.e., replacing the concrete implementation with an implementation only considering the necessary behavior for a specific test case. In this paper we follow this technique and present an approach for automatically deriving the behavior of mock objects from given Design by Contract™ specifications. The generated mock objects behave according to the Design by Contract™ specification of the original class. Furthermore, we make sure that the observed behavior of the mock object satisfies the pre-condition of the method under test. We evaluate the approach using the Java implementations of 20 common Design Patterns and a stack based calculator. Our approach clearly outperforms pure random data generation in terms of line coverage.

Such systems often rely on streams of sensor data for intelligent methods of analyzing daily activity patterns and acting on any detected exception conditions. During the initial development phase of one such system a need for defining the requirements for sensor placements, efficient sensor data formats and transmission protocols became apparent, later unit testing and the final validation phases demanded generation of large amounts of suitable sensor test data. In this paper we describe a simulator we developed in order to support both the hardware and software developments of a collaborative project for an assisted living system designed to leverage smart remote monitoring and home security technology.

Archaeological excavation units, test pits, feature fill, and natural exposures contain sediments used to interpret geomorphic history that can, in turn, shed light on archaeological site selection in a challenging environment. The Grand Canyon experiences dramatic geomorphic events such as catastrophic floods and destructive debris flows that are preserved in the stratigraphic record, and can be used to understand cultural/landscape interactions. By combining new geomorphic, stratigraphic, and archaeological data collected during recent excavations with results from previous geomorphic and sediment transport studies, observed trends can be interpreted regarding the possible influence of paleofloods on past settlement patterns. For example, at each of the four sites, reconstructed paleoflood elevations (from existing HEC-RAS virtual shorelines), flood recurrence intervals, site layout, and site stratigraphy/geomorphic setting suggests a temporal trend in site location. The two early sites (Early Pueblo II period: A.D. 1050-1080) contain habitation features located above the approximately 6-8. year high flood (3500. cubic meters per second [cms]) recurrence interval; larger floods (4800 to 5900. cms) of a longer recurrence interval between 40 and 80. years inundate these features. The two later sites in the sample (Late Pueblo II; A.D. 1080-1170) contain habitation features located well above the 40-80. year recurrence high flows. We suggest that early farmers (Early Pueblo II period: A.D. 1050-1080) may not have had adequate experience with flood magnitudes and frequencies and therefore their habitation structures were located in risk-prone areas relatively close to the river. Later habitations (Late Pueblo II; A.D. 1080-1170) were positioned in more protected areas further from the river, perhaps reflecting an acquired knowledge of river dynamics. These trends, although currently based on a limited data set, provide insights into site selection decisions and settlement patterns of early farmers along the Colorado River through Grand Canyon. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Colorado River; Geoarchaeology; Geomorphology; Grand Canyon; Paleoflood; Pueblo II","Arizona; Colorado River [North America]; Grand Canyon; United States; agricultural worker; archaeological evidence; data acquisition; debris flow; decision making; excavation; fluvial geomorphology; paleoflood; recurrence interval; settlement pattern; site selection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951948984"

Survival infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at significant risk for neurodevelopmental impairment, either as a result of in utero physiological effects of abnormal circulation, associated congenital brain anomalies, neurodevelopmental compromise before, during and after surgical repair, or combinations of all these factors. This book examines the neurodevelopmental outcomes for patients with CHD, risk factors for adverse neurodevelopmental sequelae and peri- and intraoperative neuromonitoring and neuroprotective strategies. Furthermore, electroencephalography (EEG) has been utilized for decades in the neonatal intensive care unit to assess brain maturation, detect and localize brain injury, diagnose seizures and give prognostic information. This book reviews specific EEG/aEEG patterns and their value in predicting long term neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants. Also examined are the risks and benefits of physical activity in epileptics, sports in which epileptics may participate and the positive effect of physical exercise in experimental models of epilepsy. Other chapters in this book examine the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, tangle dominant dementia (TDD), a sporadic subtype of late onset progressive dementia, the effects of methylphenidate (MPD) treatment in adolescence on MPD response in adulthood, and a discussion of the ""neurodevelopmental abnormality"" theory, which proposes that some schizophrenics suffer from subtle neurodevelopmental insults during fetal development. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The cross-entropy (CE) method, originated from an adaptive variance minimization algorithm for estimating probabilities of rare events, is a generic approach to combinatorial and multi-extremal optimization. Exploration capability of CE algorithm is enhanced in this paper by using chaotic sequence and the resultant ECE is applied to DED with valve-point effects. The performance of the proposed ECE method is rigorously tested for optimality, convergence, robustness and computational efficiency on a 10-unit test system. Additional test cases with different load patterns and increased number of generators are also solved by ECE. Numerical results show that the proposed ECE approach finds high-quality solutions reliably with faster convergence. It outperforms CE and all the previous approaches. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

One hundred seventy-three children (84 boys) with a mean diabetes duration of 4.9 ± 2.8 years participated in this observational study. Medical charts were reviewed for background, disease- and treatment-related parameters, and growth parameters. Study endpoints were HbA1c value, rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis events, and growth patterns. Mean HbA1c for the total duration of diabetes (HbA1c-TDD) was 7.9 ± 0.8%. Comparison of the study variables between patients with HbA1c-TDD <7.5% (n = 53) or ≥7.5% yielded a significantly shorter duration of diabetes (P = 0.01) and lower rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (P = 0.02) in those with HbA1C-TDD <7.5%, without differences between these groups in age at diabetes onset, insulin regimens, daily glucose measurements, and rate of severe hypoglycemia. Factors significantly predicting achievement of the mean target HbA1c-TDD <7.5% were lower HbA1c at 0.5 years and 1 year after diabetes diagnosis (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). Patients followed for at least 5 years (n = 48) showed a significant decrease in height-SDS (P < 0.001) and a significant increase in weight-SDS (P = 0.004) from diabetes diagnosis to the last follow-up visit, without a significant change in weight-SDS from 0.5 years after diagnosis to the last follow-up visit. Our results suggest that in patients with T1D diagnosed during the preschool-age, mean HbA1c level in the first year is a strong predictor of achieving target HbA1c level in the subsequent years, regardless the type of insulin regimen. This metabolic tracking emphasizes the importance of achieving early optimal control even in younger children. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Glycemic control; Growth; Type 1 diabetes","Adolescent; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Child; Child, Preschool; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; insulin aspart; insulin detemir; insulin glargine; insulin lispro; recombinant human insulin; thyroxine; adolescent; article; blood glucose monitoring; child; continuous infusion; disease association; disease duration; disease severity; female; follow up; glycemic control; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; ketoacidosis; major clinical study; male; observational study; onset age; outcome assessment; prediction; preschool child; priority journal; risk factor; school child","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867996029"

A multithreaded unit test creates two or more threads, each executing one or more methods on shared objects of the class under test. Such unit tests can be generated at random, but basic random generation produces tests that are either slow or do not trigger concurrency bugs. Worse, such tests have many false alarms, which require human effort to filter out. We present Ballerina, a novel technique for automated random generation of efficient multithreaded tests that effectively trigger concurrency bugs. Ballerina makes tests efficient by having only two threads, each executing a single, randomly selected method. Ballerina increases chances that such simple parallel code finds bugs by appending it to more complex, randomly generated sequential code. We also propose a clustering technique to reduce the manual effort in inspecting failures of automatically generated multithreaded tests. We evaluate Ballerina on 14 real-world bugs from six popular codebases: Groovy, JDK, JFreeChart, Apache Log4j, Apache Lucene, and Apache Pool. The experiments show that tests generated by Ballerina find bugs on average 2X-10X faster than basic random generation, and our clustering technique reduces the number of inspected failures on average 4X-8X. Using Ballerina, we found three previously unknown bugs, two of which were already confirmed and fixed. © 2012 IEEE.","","Automatic programming; Software engineering; Apache Lucene; Automatic Generation; Automatically generated; Class under tests; Clustering techniques; False alarms; Multithreaded; Novel techniques; Parallel code; Random generation; Shared objects; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864224668"

A key problem when automatically generating unit tests that achieve high structural code coverage is the selection of relevant method-call sequences, since the number of potentially relevant sequences explodes with the number of methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, called DyGen, that generates tests via mining dynamic traces recorded during program executions. Typical program executions tend to exercise only happy paths that do not include error-handling code, and thus recorded traces often do not achieve high structural coverage. To increase coverage, DyGen transforms traces into parameterized unit tests (PUTs) and uses dynamic symbolic execution to generate new unit tests for the PUTs that can achieve high structural code coverage. In this paper, we show an application of DyGen by automatically generating regression tests on a given version of software. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","dynamic symbolic execution; object-oriented unit testing; regression testing","Regression analysis; Software testing; Testing; Wavelet transforms; Object oriented; Regression testing; Symbolic execution; Unit testing; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954695973"

Design and setting: Observational analysis of testosterone prescribing data obtained from two independent data sources-the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and IMS, a source of commercial pharmaceutical sales data. Main outcome measures: Temporal trends in testosterone prescribing-measured as units prescribed (converted into monthly defined doses) and expenditure-according to state or territory and product type (injectable, implantable, transdermal and oral). Results: Over two decades, total annual expenditure on testosterone products increased ninefold to $12.7 million according to PBS data and fivefold to $16.3 million according to IMS data. When adjusted for inflation and population growth, expenditure increased 4.5-fold according to PBS data and 2.5-fold according to IMS data. The patterns of testosterone prescribing according to PBS and IMS data were highly congruent. When converted into monthly defined dose units, testosterone prescribing increased over the two decades with approximately twofold differences in total testosterone prescribed per capita between the states and territories with the highest and lowest rates of prescribing. When analysed by product type, the stable market patterns over the first 15 years were disrupted by sharp changes to create market dominance owing to introduction of two new testosterone products-a depot injectable testosterone and a transdermal testosterone gel. Conclusions: The progressive increase in PBS-subsidised testosterone prescribing without changes in proven medical indications or improvements in diagnosis of pathologically based androgen deficiency are likely to be due to promotion-driven non-compliance with PBS prescribing criteria, indicating that more effective implementation of the criteria is needed.","","Androgens; Australia; Health Expenditures; Humans; Male; Pharmacoepidemiology; Physician's Practice Patterns; Testosterone; reandron; testosterone; testosterone undecanoate; unclassified drug; androgen; testosterone; article; Australia; cost benefit analysis; data analysis; drug dosage form; drug dosage form comparison; drug indication; gel; health care cost; observational study; pharmacoepidemiology; postmarketing surveillance; prescription; transdermal patch; trend study; clinical practice; economics; human; male; pharmacoepidemiology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84865077426"

However the time and spatial reuse characteristics of RS should be taken into account in order to mitigate the co-channel interference. This paper presents two adaptive frequency reuse schemes for MRN by using different reuse patterns in different time zones of the same frame. In our schemes, reuse pattern of 1x3x1 is applied in the Relay Zone (RZ), and 1x3x3 is applied in the Access Zone (AZ). The former allows only the two RSs which are located farthest apart in one cell to share the same frequency portion; while in the latter two adjacent RSs may share the same resources. Analysis and simulation results show that both schemes improve the system throughput greatly. The comparison of coverage and throughput between the two schemes indicates that the latter scheme has better performance and an aggressive full reuse scheme could be utilized to all RSs. ©2010 IEEE.","1x3x1; 1x3x3; Frequency reuse; Two-hop relay","Cochannel interference; Relay control systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adaptive frequency; Analysis and simulation; Frequency re-use; Frequency resources; Multi-hop relay networks; Relay stations; Spatial reuse; System throughput; Time zones; Two-hop relay networks; Wireless networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955026120"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach and framework for specifying and testing the inter-dependencies between the process-under-test and its partner services.

A 4 μm-thick ELO-AlN layer with stripe pattern along <10-10> direction of AlN can be coalesced successfully.

Multithreaded code is getting increasingly important but remains extremely hard to develop and test. Most recent research on testing multithreaded code focuses solely on finding bugs in one given version of code. While there are many promising results, the tools are fairly slow (as they, conceptually, explore a large number of schedules) and do not exploit the fact that code evolves over several versions during development and maintenance. Our proposal is to allow explicit specification of relevant schedules (either manually written or automatically generated) for multithreaded tests, which can substantially speed up testing, especially for evolving code. To enable the use of schedules, we propose to design a novel language for specifying schedules in multithreaded tests, and to develop tools for automatic generation of multithreaded tests and for improved regression testing with multithreaded tests. © 2010 ACM.","","Computer software maintenance; Software engineering; Software testing; Testing; Automatic Generation; Automatically generated; Multithreaded; Position papers; Regression testing; Speed-ups; Unit testing; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954598990"

However, testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy, distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows MAS developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the JUnit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The aspect of the system we are focusing on is stability. For user scheduling for stability as a performance measure, both the queue and channel states need to be known by the base station. However channel states can be known only via feedback from the receivers. In order to collect CQI feedback from each user at one channel, a fraction of the available time for transmission is used. This means that the time left to transmit is getting smaller. We present a joint feedback and scheduling algorithm which can guarantee an expansion of the stability region with respect to prior works. We also provide expressions regarding the distribution of the time needed to be devoted for feedback at each channel in some special cases. The proposed algorithm does not need knowledge of the statistics of the channels and traffic patterns. Simulations illustrate the operation of the proposed scheme. © 2013 IEEE.","","Communication channels (information theory); Channel state feedbacks; Downlink systems; Parallel channel; Performance measure; Scheduling schemes; Stability regions; Traffic pattern; User scheduling; Scheduling","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893235037"

Prior to our enrollment in this research, the environment supported use case construction, requirements document analysis, requirements traceability and use case points estimation. In this paper it is presented a strategy to generate test scenarios for unit testing and integration testing, based on use case model. Such test scenarios are generated automatically through a module that uses information from this broader environment and they are a starting point to test case definition. The data modeling was based on some proposals found in literature which provided the means to implement the dependency chart, graphs and the test tree. Such structures supported the test scenarios generation. Based on a system previously tested from a real company, we compared the unit and integration test scenarios generated by the environment and the results showed that some test cases were not covered by our new module but, on the other side, some generated scenarios were not planned by the company. With this in mind, the test scenarios automatically generated by the environment can be considered as a support to the test plan elaboration and to the test case definition.","Automated environment; Integration test scenarios; Test scenarios generation; Unit test scenarios; Use case","Software engineering; Testing; Trees (mathematics); Automated environments; Automatically generated; Dependency chart; Requirements document; Requirements traceability; Research groups; Test scenario; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84886652154"

Such tests are typically case-based, checking a likely error scenario or an error that has previously been identified and fixed. Coming up with good test cases is challenging, and focusing on individual tests can distract from creating tests that cover the full functionality. Axioms, known from program specification, allow for an alternative way of generating test cases, where the intended functionality is described as rules or equations that can be checked automatically. Axioms are proposed as part of the concept feature of the upcoming C++0x standard. In this paper, we describe how tests may be generated automatically from axioms in C++ concepts, and supplied with appropriate test data to form exctive automated unit tests.

Developers can then manually write ""glue"" code so that these scenarios can be translated into executable software tests. This glue code represents individual steps within unit and acceptance test cases, and tools exist that automate the mapping from scenario descriptions to manually written code steps (typically using regular expressions). This paper takes the position that, instead of requiring programmers to write manual glue code, it is practical to convert natural language scenario descriptions into executable software tests fully automatically. To show feasibility, this paper presents preliminary results from a tool called Kirby that uses natural language processing techniques to automatically generate executable software tests from structured English scenario descriptions. Kirby relieves the developer from the laborious work of writing code for the individual steps described in scenarios, so that both developers and customers can both focus on the scenarios as pure behavior descriptions (understandable to all, not just programmers). Preliminary results from assessing the performance and accuracy of this technique are presented.

Whilst it is effective in promoting and rewarding deep approaches to learning in some settings, we hypothesised that implementation of the curriculum (design and assessment) may impact on students' preparation for the PT and their learning. Aim To compare students' perceptions of and preparations for the PT at two medical schools. Method Focus groups were used to generate items for a questionnaire. This was piloted, refined, and then delivered at both schools. Exploratory factor analysis identified the main factors underpinning response patterns. ANOVA was used to compare differences in response by school, year group and gender. Results Response rates were 640 (57%) and 414 (47%) at Schools A and B, respectively. Three major factors were identified: the PT's ability to (1) assess academic learning (2) support clinical learning; (3) the PT's impact on exam preparation. Significant differences were found between settings. In the school with early clinical contact, more frequent PTs and no end of unit tests, students were more likely to appreciate the PT as a support for learning, perceive it as fair and valid, and use a deeper approach to learning-but they also spent longer preparing for the test. Conclusion Different approaches to the delivery of the PT can impact significantly on student study patterns. The learning environment has an important impact on student perceptions of assessment and approach to learning. Careful decisions about PT deployment must be taken to ensure its optimal impact. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Assessment; Learning environment; Medical education; Problem based learning; Progress test","Analysis of Variance; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; England; Focus Groups; Humans; Interdisciplinary Studies; Perception; Problem-Based Learning; Questionnaires; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Test Taking Skills; analysis of variance; article; comparative study; curriculum; education; human; information processing; interdisciplinary education; medical education; medical school; medical student; methodology; organization and management; perception; problem based learning; psychological aspect; questionnaire; standard; statistics; study skills; United Kingdom","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866075975"

A lack of unit tests can hinder effective and efficient maintenance processes. Introducing unit tests after deployment is a promising approach for (a) enabling systematic and automation-supported tests after deployment and (b) increasing product quality significantly. An important question is whether unit tests should be introduced manually by humans or automatically generated by tools. This paper focuses on an empirical investigation of tool-supported and human-based unit testing in a controlled experiment with focus on defect detection effectiveness, false positives, and test coverage of two different testing approaches applied to unfamiliar source code.

Concolic testing alleviates this problem by automatically generating test cases that achieve high coverage. However, specialized execution platforms and resource constraints of embedded software hinder application of concolic testing to embedded software. To overcome these limitations, we have developed CONcrete and symBOLic (CONBOL) testing framework to unit test large size industrial embedded software automatically. To address the aforementioned limitations, CONBOL tests target units on a host PC platform by generating symbolic unit testing drivers/stubs automatically and applying heuristics to reduce false alarms caused by the imprecise drivers/stubs. We have applied CONBOL to four million lines long industrial embedded software and detected 24 new crash bugs. Furthermore, the development team of the target software adopted CONBOL to their development process to apply CONBOL to the revised target software regularly. © 2013 IEEE.","","Automation; Concrete testing; Embedded software; Industry; Software engineering; Software testing; Automated unit testing; Concolic testing; Current testing; Development process; Development teams; Execution platforms; Resource Constraint; Testing framework; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893544389"

For AlxGa1-xN layers with x = 0.8 the difference in Al content between facets and surrounding material is much smaller. Therefore, the threading dislocation density (TDD) is only defined by the TDD in the underlying epitaxially laterally overgrown (ELO) AlN layer. This way high quality Al0.8Ga0.2N with a thickness up to 1.5 μm and a TDD ≤ 5×108 cm-2 was obtained.","","Aluminum; Cathodoluminescence; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; Annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy; Dislocation formation; Epitaxially laterally overgrown; Inhomogeneities; Metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy; Structural and optical properties; Surrounding materials; Threading dislocation densities; Optical properties","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84890742078"

In the current SRS pattern scheme, because SRSs of up to eight users are multiplexed on the same time-frequency resources, there exist mutual interferences among these SRSs over fading channels. Thus, the current scheme impacts the estimation accuracy of CSI and degrades the beamforming performance. Based on the characteristics of TDD systems, the authors propose a SRS pattern scheme, in which each user sends SRSs only on the allocated bandwidth instead of on full bandwidth as in the current LTE TDD systems, to eliminate the interferences among SRSs. Simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the current scheme in the estimation accuracy for various frequency-selective and time-selective fading channels. In addition, compared with the current SRS pattern scheme, the proposed SRS pattern scheme is robust to frequency-selective channels, and does not be impacted by the timing offset, and provides the flexibility for the choice of channel estimator at the BS side. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.","","Bandwidth; Beamforming; Channel state information; Estimation; Fading channels; MIMO systems; Multiplexing equipment; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Channel estimator; Current schemes; Downlink beam-forming; Downlink channels; Frequency-selective; Frequency-selective channels; Long-term evolution; Mutual interference; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems; Reference signals; Time division duplex; Time frequency; Time-division duplex systems; Time-selective fading channel; Timing offsets; Frequency estimation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862255504"

Constructed wetland, as a kind of waste water treatment technologies with high efficiency and low cost, is widely used to treat different types of waste water. Because of the fact that Beijing residents in rural areas are relatively scattered and centralizing waste water is difficult, economical and easily constructed wetland project was carried out in Yang zhen No.l Middle School of Beijing. The aim of this research is to make foundation for the applicatioiLof constructed wetland in northern area of China. The project is consisted of buried integrative pretreatment system, multi-level complex constructed wetland system and wetland landscape system. Its effective area is 400 m 2. It can be divided into two east-west parallel connected systems with the 1 : 1 ratio of the length to the width. Each system is composed of many various subsurface flow wetlands in different orders, such as the vertical downward flow wetland and vertical upward flow wetland, and horizontal flow wetland. The paper presents detailed analysis of the constructed wetland location, mechanism design, water sample collection, test analysis, feature and the essentials. Through unit test, some innovations are made in packing structure, plant selection, water distribution design, water level regulation, designing system of preventing wetland from blocking and the design of pretreatment system. The effect of hydraulic retention time (1 day, 2 days and 3 days) on waste removal is analyzed. The constructed wetlands substrate clogging experiment, winter insulation measurement research, and studies on the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wetlands are carried out. The processing effect of the constructed wetland and the hydraulic retention time is closely related. Two days of the hydraulic retention time is suitable to the removal of chemical oxygen demand. In constructed wetland, 0-10 m horizontal distance, 0-5 cm, 30-35 cm, and 60-65 cm depth matrix blockage dates are significantly different (n=9, p < 0.05). The most obvious matrix blockage occurs at 0 m, 2 m and 4 m. So if matrix needs changing, the only thing to do is to change 0-4 m to save spending and reduce disturbance to the normal operation of the constructed wetland. In winter, film cover system and ice cover system can both increase the removal rate of total nitrogen. Generally speaking, film cover system is better and more suitable for the northern area, because there are many merits of the film cover system. It can run uninterruptedly and easily. Plants do not plant again. What is more, it costs little. Buried integrative pretreatment system, multi-level complex constructed wetland system and wetland landscape system can treat waste water jointly so that the effluent can meet Beijing waste water discharge first-level B (total nitrogen content is 20 mg/L, total phosphorus content is 0.5 mg/L).The three characteristics of the waste water disposal project are as follows. First of all, winter pipe system and winter insulation measurements, such as film cover system and ice cover system, are used to make sure the constructed wetland system can run normally in winter. Secondly, many aeration measurements have been taken in the constructed wetland system and the constructed wetlands substrate clogging experiment is carried out to prevent the constructed wetland substrate from jamming. Thirdly, wetland landscape system is built to treat waste water further and increase the environment biodiversity. The design of the waste water disposal project is rational and the parameter is feasible, so it can be used as a pattern in northern area of China.","Buried integration pretreatment system; Constructed wetlands; Landscape wetland; Rural domestic sewage; Treatment effect on waste water","Beijing [China]; China; aeration; biodiversity; chemical oxygen demand; constructed wetland; domestic waste; experimental study; film; flow pattern; ice cover; landscape structure; nitrogen; phosphorus; pollutant removal; rural development; subsurface flow; waste disposal; waste treatment; wastewater; water level; water pollution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84859954687"

We found previous test generation techniques inadequate for two main reasons. First. they were designed for and evaluated upon libraries rather than applications. Second, they were designed to find bugs rather than to create maintainable regression test suites: the test suites that they generated were brittle and hard to understand. This paper presents a suite of techniques that address these problems by enhancing an existing unit test generation system. In experiments using an industrial system, the generated tests achieved good coverage and mutation kill score, were readable by the product's developers, and required few edits as the system under test evolved. While our evaluation is in the context of one test generator, we are aware of many research systems that suffer similar limitations, so our approach and observations are more generally relevant. © 2011 IEEE.","","Automation; Regression analysis; Software engineering; Software testing; Testing; Automated test generations; Automatic technique; Industrial systems; Regression tests; Research system; Scaling-up; System under test; Test generations; Unit test generations; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855459912"

Cognitive biases, which are defined as patterned deviations of human thought from the laws of logic and mathematics, are a likely cause of software defects. However, there is little empirical evidence to date to substantiate this assertion. In this research, we focus on a specific cognitive bias, confirmation bias, which is defined as the tendency of people to seek evidence that verifies a hypothesis rather than seeking evidence to falsify a hypothesis. Due to this confirmation bias, developers tend to perform unit tests to make their program work rather than to break their code. Therefore, confirmation bias is believed to be one of the factors that lead to an increased software defect density. In this research, we present a metric scheme that explores the impact of developers' confirmation bias on software defect density. In order to estimate the effectiveness of our metric scheme in the quantification of confirmation bias within the context of software development, we performed an empirical study that addressed the prediction of the defective parts of software. In our empirical study, we used confirmation bias metrics on five datasets obtained from two companies. Our results provide empirical evidence that human thought processes and cognitive aspects deserve further investigation to improve decision making in software development for effective process management and resource allocation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Confirmation bias; Defect prediction; Human factors; Software psychology","Behavioral research; Computer software selection and evaluation; Decision making; Defect density; Human engineering; Human resource management; Software design; Software testing; Cognitive aspects; Confirmation bias; Defect prediction; Defective parts; Empirical studies; Process management; Software defects; Software psychology; Software quality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875477125"

Unfortunately, input-dependent loops may cause an explosion in the number of constraints to be solved and in the number of execution paths to be explored. In practice, whitebox fuzzers arbitrarily bound the number of constraints and paths due to input-dependent loops, at the risk of missing code and bugs. In this work, we investigate the use of simple loop-guard pattern-matching rules to automatically guess an input constraint defining the number of iterations of input-dependent loops during dynamic symbolic execution. We discover the loop structure of the program on the fly, detect induction variables, which are variables modified by a constant value during loop iterations, and infer simple partial loop invariants relating the value of such variables. Whenever a guess is confirmed later during the current dynamic symbolic execution, we then inject new constraints representing pre and post loop conditions, effectively summarizing sets of executions of that loop. These pre and post conditions are derived from partial loop invariants synthesized dynamically using pattern-matching rules on the loop guards and induction variables, without requiring any static analysis, theorem proving, or input-format specification. This technique has been implemented in the whitebox fuzzer SAGE, scales to large programs with many nested loops, and we present results of experiments with a Windows 7 image parser. © 2011 ACM.","loop invariant generation; program summarization; program testing and verification","Computer software selection and evaluation; Natural language processing systems; Static analysis; Theorem proving; Constraint Solving; Current dynamics; Dynamic symbolic executions; Dynamic tests; Execution paths; Induction variables; Input constraints; Large programs; Loop conditions; Loop invariants; Loop iteration; Loop structure; Missing codes; Nested Loops; Number of iterations; On the flies; Pre and post conditions; program summarization; Program testing; Security testing; Symbolic execution; Unit testing; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80051944492"

With this setup, the DL/UL configurations are no longer determined with respect to an individual cell, but are chosen in form of the cluster-specific configuration patterns (CPs) with optimized performance metrics.

We have implemented this technique in IRULAN, a fully automatic tool for systematic black-box unit testing of Haskell library code. We have designed IRULAN to generate high coverage test suites and detect common programming errors in the process. We have applied IRULAN to over 50 programs from the spectral and real suites of the nofib benchmark and show that it can effectively generate high-coverage test suites - exhibiting 70.83% coverage for spectral and 59.78% coverage for real - and find errors in these programs.

To do so, Pex performs a systematic program analysis, similar to path bounded model-checking.

Such bugs are often hard to reproduce because they typically happen under very specific interleaving of the executing threads. Basically, it is very hard to fix a bug (or software failure) in concurrent programs without being able to reproduce it. In this paper, we present an approach, called ConCrash, that automatically and deterministically reproduces concurrent failures by recording logical thread schedule and generating unit tests. For a given bug (failure), ConCrash records the logical thread scheduling order and preserves object states in memory at runtime. Then, ConCrash reproduces the failure offline by simply using the saved information without the need for JVM-level or OS-level support. To reduce the runtime performance overhead, ConCrash employs a static data race detection technique to report potential possible race conditions, and only instruments such places. We implement the ConCrash approach in a prototype tool for Java and experimented on a number of multi-threaded Java benchmarks. As a result, we successfully reproduced a number of real concurrent bugs (e.g., deadlocks, data races and atomicity violation) within an acceptable overhead. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","","Automatic test pattern generation; Computer software; Safety engineering; Concurrent failures; Concurrent program; Concurrent threads; Data race detection; Data races; Generating unit; Multithreaded; Offline; Prototype tools; Race condition; Runtime performance; Runtimes; Software failure; Thread scheduling; Program debugging","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77951292783"

Thousands of theoretical papers and a number of books on data clustering have been published over the past 50 years. However, few books exist to teach people how to implement data clustering algorithms. This book was written for anyone who wants to implement or improve their data clustering algorithms. Using object-oriented design and programming techniques, Data Clustering in C++: An Object-Oriented Approach exploits the commonalities of all data clustering algorithms to create a flexible set of reusable classes that simplifies the implementation of any data clustering algorithm. Readers can follow the development of the base data clustering classes and several popular data clustering algorithms. Additional topics such as data pre-processing, data visualization, cluster visualization, and cluster interpretation are briefly covered. This book is divided into three parts— • Data Clustering and C++ Preliminaries: A review of basic concepts of data clustering, the unified modeling language, object-oriented programming in C++, and design patterns • A C++ Data Clustering Framework: The development of data clustering base classes • Data Clustering Algorithms: The implementation of several popular data clustering algorithms A key to learning a clustering algorithm is to implement and experiment the clustering algorithm. Complete listings of classes, examples, unit test cases, and GNU configuration files are included in the appendices of this book as well as in the CD-ROM of the book.

This paper illustrates the approach that I am investigating and that consists in capturing information in unit test cases with static analysis techniques to automatically merge unit test cases to produce useful integration test cases. The preliminary results reported in this paper provide evidence of the effectiveness of the approach. My current research is developing the approach further and producing additional experimental evidence.

We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns.

One method for generating unit tests is to use formal class and method specifications as test oracles and automatically run them with developer-provided data values; for Java code with formal specifications written in the Java Modeling Language, this method is embodied in the JMLUnit tool and the JUnit testing framework on which it is based. While JMLUnit can provide reasonable test coverage when used by a skilled developer, it suffers from several shortcomings including excessive memory utilization during testing and the need to manually write significant amounts of code to generate non-primitive test data objects. In this paper we describe JMLUnitNG, a TestNG-based successor to JMLUnit that can automatically generate and execute millions of tests, using supplied test data of only primitive types, without consuming excessive amounts of memory.

A study - carried out on four Java programs, Ant 1.8.3, ArgoUML 0.20, Check Style 4.0, and JFreeChart 1.0.13 - supports the evidence that, on the one hand, antipatterns unit testing requires, on average, a number of test cases substantially higher than unit testing for non-antipattern classes. On the other hand, antipattern classes must be carefully tested because they are more defect-prone than other classes. Finally, we illustrate how specific refactoring actions - applied to classes participating in antipatterns - could reduce testing cost. © 2013 IEEE.","Antipatterns; Object oriented testing; Refactoring; Testing cost","Computer software; Computer software maintenance; Defects; Java programming language; Reengineering; Anti-patterns; Data members; Defect proneness; Java program; Object-oriented testing; Refactorings; Software systems; Testing costs; Costs","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84877308389"

The growth condition of the 3D-2D growth process is optimized to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD). It is found that the condition of the 3D layer is critical. The 3D layer keeps growing under the conditions of low V/III ratio, low temperature, and high pressure until its thickness is comparable to the height of the cone-shaped patterns. Then the 3D layer surrounds the cone-shaped patterns and has inclined side facets and a top (0001) plane. In the following 2D-growth process, inclined side facets coalesce quickly and the interaction of TDs with the side facets causes the TDs to bend over.

To reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) at low thickness, Ge deposition with cyclic annealing followed by HCl etching is performed. In the case of blanket Ge deposition, a TDD of 1.3 × 106 cm- 2 is obtained, when the Ge layer is etched back from 4.5 μm thickness to 1.8 μm. The TDD is not increased relative to the situation before etching. The root mean square of roughness of the 1.8 μm thick Ge is about 0.46 nm, which is of the same level as before HCl etching. Further etching shows increased surface roughness caused by non-uniform strain distribution near the interface due to misfit dislocations and threading dislocations. The TDD also becomes higher because the etchfront of Ge reaches areas with high dislocation density near the interface. In the case of selective Ge growth, a slightly lower TDD is observed in smaller windows caused by a weak pattern size dependence on Ge thickness. A significant decrease of TDD of selectively grown Ge is also observed by increasing the Ge thickness. An about 10 times lower TDD at the same Ge thickness is demonstrated by applying a combination of deposition and etching processes during selective Ge growth. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the performance of AlGaNbased DUV LEDs on sapphire substrates have increased markedly due to improvements in the crystalline-quality of high Al-content AlGaN layers, and the optimization of LED structures. On the other hand, DUV LEDs fabricated on Si substrates are very promising as a low-cost DUV light-source in the near future. However, AlN layers on Si have suffered from cracking induced by the large mismatch in lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients between AlN and Si. In this paper, DUV LEDs on Si were realized by a combination of a reduction in the number of cracks and of the threading dislocation density (TDD) of AlN templates by using the epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) method. The ELO-AlN templates were successfully coalesced on trench-patterned substrates, with the stripes running along the <1-100> direction of AlN. The density of cracks was greatly reduced in 4- m-thick ELO-AlN templates, because voids formed by the ELO process relaxed the tensile stress in the AlN layer. Furthermore, the AlN templates showed low-TDD. The full-width-at-half-maximum values of the (0002) and (10-12) X-ray rocking curves were 780 and 980 arcsec, respectively. DUV LEDs fabricated on these high-quality ELO-AlN/Si substrates showed single peak emission at 256- 278 nm in electroluminescence measurements. It is expected that we will be able to realize low-cost DUV LEDs on Si substrates by using ELO-AlN templates. © 2013 SPIE.","AlGaN; AlN template; Crack; DUV LED; Epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO); Low-TDD; Si substrate; Void","Cracks; Electroluminescence; Epitaxial growth; Gallium nitride; Sapphire; Silicon; Structural optimization; Substrates; Thermal expansion; Water supply; AlGaN; AlN; Duv leds; Epitaxial lateral overgrowth; Low-TDD; Si substrates; Void; Light emitting diodes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84878700831"

In many such systems these defects are the result of interactions among no more than 6 variables, suggesting that 6-way combinatorial testing would be sufficient to trigger and detect them. The National Institute of Standards and Technology developed an approach to automatically generating, executing, and analyzing such tests. This paper describes an industry proof-of-concept demonstration of automated unit and integration testing using this approach. The goal was to see if it might cost-effectively reduce rework by reducing the number of software defects escaping into system test-if it was adequately accurate, scalable, mature, easy to learn, and easy to use and still was able to achieve the required level of structural coverage. Results were positive-e.g., 2775 test input vectors were generated in 6 seconds, expected outputs were generated in 60 minutes, and executing and analyzing them took 8 minutes.

These different requirements of interactive system testing are not easily combined within a single testing strategy. We investigate the use of models of interactive systems, which have been derived from design artefacts, as the basis for generating tests for an implemented system. We show how automatically generated abstract tests can be used as the basis for a model-based method for testing interactive systems which has low overhead in terms of the models required and which enables testing of UI and system functionality from the perspective of user interaction. We also examine other testing strategies which use the same abstract tests as their basis and discuss general problems in the area of interactive system testing and propose some solutions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.","Formal methods; Prototyping; Unit testing; User interface","Automatic test pattern generation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Formal methods; Software prototyping; System theory; Automatically generated; Interactive system; Model based testing; Model-based method; System functionality; Testing strategies; Unit testing; User interaction; User interfaces","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84881490451"

However, TDD is one of the most challenging agile practices to adopt because it requires changes to work practices and skill sets. It is therefore important to gain an understanding of TDD through the experiences of those who have successfully adopted this practice. We collaborated with an agile team to provide this experience report on their adoption of TDD, using observations and interviews within the product development environment. This article highlights a number of practices that underlie successful development with TDD. To provide a theoretical perspective that can help to explain how TDD supports a positive philosophy of software development, we have revised Northover et al.’s conceptual framework, which is based on a four stage model of agile development, to reinterpret Popper’s theory of conjecture and falsification in the context of agile testing strategies. As a result of our findings, we propose an analytical model for TDD in agile software development which provides a theoretical basis for further investigations into the role of TDD and related practices. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Agile methods; Design patterns; Pair programming; Software architecture; Test driven development; Testing strategies","Computer programming; Software testing; Agile development; Agile software development; Conceptual frameworks; Development cycle; Development environment; Experience report; Four-stage model; Test driven development; Software design","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052344770"

Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) has thus been greatly developed in the past ten years in order to be able to by-pass the skin protective layers in a minimally invasive way. With the advent of micro electro mechanical systems, opportunities have appeared, particularly in the area of microneedles. In this paper we present a new design of hollow polymeric microneedles aimed at being used for TDD by allowing injection of a liquid in the non-innerve part of the dermis. The design has been studied in order to be able to manufacture these microneedles arrays using techniques that may be applicable to industrial production at low cost. The envisioned microfabrication processes and their stacking are presented which involve injection micromolding and excimer laser ablation. Microneedles are also numerically characterized in terms of mechanics and microfluidics showing that the design also involves interesting features in terms of needles resistance and microfluidic. Due to the innovative double-molding technique, the micro-needles are indeed emptied leaving a cavity. An outlet channel on the side of the needle allows fluid flowing out of the needles. The characteristics of this outlet channel contribute to flow homogenization when several needles are placed in an array pattern. This microneedle design thus combines interesting characteristics in terms of ease of fabrication at large scale, mechanical resistance and fluid dynamics. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","","Ablation; Design; Drug delivery; Excimer lasers; Manufacture; Microfluidics; Micromachining; Molding; Polymers; Array patterns; Drug administration; Fluid flowing; Industrial production; Innovative design; Low costs; Mechanical resistance; Micro electro mechanical system; Microfabrication process; Micromolding; Microneedles; Minimally invasive; Negative image; New design; Protective layers; Transdermal drug delivery; Needles","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80755153550"

Two different buffer layer schemes between the film and the sapphire substrate were used, giving rise to differing threading dislocation densities (TDDs) in the GaN. Frequency-dependent capacitance and conductance measurements have been used to study the electronic states associated with the Mg doping, and to determine how these are affected by the TDD. Current-voltage and admittance spectroscopy measurements were carried out using Al/Au Schottky contacts and Ni/Au Ohmic contacts fabricated in a dot-and-ring pattern. Frequency-dependent measurements on these devices were corrected to remove the series resistance effects arising from the well known high resistivity of Mg-doped GaN using formulae derived from the equivalent parallel circuit model. Thermal admittance spectroscopy, in which the conductance is monitored as a function of temperature, verified the existence of a single impurity-related acceptor level in samples with different TDDs at 165 ± 10 meV. For all of the samples the extrapolated capture cross-section values were very small, in the range of ∼ 10 - 20 cm - 2, suggesting that the acceptor level could be very repulsive. Since admittance spectroscopy detects only majority carrier traps, we believe these defect signature values are most probably associated with the Mg acceptor state as they are very close to the results previously reported by other research groups using different techniques. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For configurator applications it is equally important but often neglected. This paper shows how to support testing object-oriented and constraint-based configurators by automatically generating positive and negative test cases using answer set programming (ASP). The object-model of the configurator is mapped to ASP code; the constraints to be tested are coded redundantly in ASP. Based on that, the ASP solver generates appropriate test cases, which are then used for unit testing in the object-oriented configurator. There are different strategies to improve this basic process, e.g. reduction of the number of test cases with symmetry breaking.","","Automatic test pattern generation; Computer programming; Logic programming; Software testing; Answer set programming; Configurator; Constraint-based; Object oriented; Software project; Support testing; Symmetry-breaking; Unit testing; Object oriented programming","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922710201"

As they do not generate oracles, it is up to the developer to figure out what a test does and how to check the correctness of the observed behavior. In this paper, we present an approach to generate parameterized unit tests - unit tests containing symbolic pre- and postconditions characterizing test input and test result. Starting from concrete inputs and results, we use test generation and mutation to systematically generalize pre- and postconditions while simplifying the computation steps. Evaluated on five open source libraries, the generated parameterized unit tests are (a) more expressive, characterizing general rather than concrete behavior; (b) need fewer computation steps, making them easier to understand; and (c) achieve a higher coverage than regular unit tests. © 2011 ACM.","assertions; test case generation; test oracles; unit testing","Automatic test pattern generation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Concrete testing; Parameterization; Testing; assertions; Automated test generations; Computation steps; Concrete behavior; Open-source libraries; Parameterized; Program behavior; State of the art; Test case generation; Test generations; Test inputs; Test oracles; Test results; Unit testing; Unit tests; Software testing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-80051920892"

Test-first strategy and code refactoring are the important practices of Extreme Programing for rapid development and quality support. The test-first strategy emphasizes that test cases are designed before system implementation to keep the correctness of artifacts during software development; whereas refactoring is the removal of ""bad smell"" code for improving quality without changing its semantics. However, the test-first strategy may conflict with code refactoring in the sense that the original test cases may be broken or inefficient for testing programs, which are revised by code refactoring. In general, the developers revise the test cases manually since it is not complicated. However, when the developers perform a pattern-based refactoring to improve the quality, the effort of revising the test cases is much more than that in simple code refactoring. In our observation, a pattern-based refactoring is composed of many simple and atomic code refactorings. If we have the composition relationship and the mapping rules between code refactoring and test case refactoring, we may infer a test case revision guideline in pattern-based refactoring. Based on this idea, in this research, we propose a four-phase approach to guide the construction of the test case refactoring for design patterns. We also introduce our approach by using some well-known design patterns and evaluate its feasibility by means of test coverage. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Code refactoring; Design pattern; Test cases refactoring; Test-driven development","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84855415766"

Test suites with high internal quality facilitate maintenance activities, such as code comprehension and regression testing. Several guidelines have been proposed to help developers write good test suites. Unfortunately, such rules are not always followed resulting in the presence of bad test code smells (or simply test smells). Test smells have been defined as poorly designed tests and their presence may negatively affect the maintainability of test suites and production code. Despite the many studies that address code smells in general, until now there has been no empirical evidence regarding test smells (i) distribution in software systems nor (ii) their impact on the maintainability of software systems. This paper fills this gap by presenting two empirical studies. The first study is an exploratory analysis of 18 software systems (two industrial and 16 open source) aimed at analyzing the distribution of test smells in source code. The second study, a controlled experiment involving twenty master students, is aimed at analyzing whether the presence of test smells affects the comprehension of source code during software maintenance.

This is done by weighting the physical throughput in each concentric coverage ring by the size of the ring. In this paper, multihop cells are formed by a central coverage zone and three outer coverage zones, which are served by cheaper low-complexity relays. Although the reuse distance in this case is augmented by a factor of √3, we show that, with the use of relays in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) mode with an adapted time-division duplexing (TDD) uplink (UL) subframe structure to accommodate communication from/to the relay station (RS) to/from subscriber station (SS), only the consideration of trisectored base stations (BSs) with a reuse pattern of K = 3 enables attainment of values for the cell per sector throughput that is comparable with cases without the use of relays. Cost/revenue optimization results show that trisectored BSs in topologies with relays enable us to achieve more profitable reuse configurations than with omnidirectional BSs and no relays. Under the same total bandwidth and with the coverage distance set at R ∼ 500 m, we show that it is preferable to consider K = 1 with three carriers per sector instead of K = 3 with one carrier per sector, whereby the profit in this case is increased from ∼1000% to ∼1450%. Furthermore, if the price [in (€/MB)] is increased from 0.0025 to 0.005, the achievable profit more than doubles. © 2010 IEEE.","Broadband communication; economics; planning; relays; Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)","Channel estimation; Interoperability; Optimization; Profitability; Throughput; Broadband Communication; Carrier-to-interference ratio; Coverage zone; Distance set; Duplexing; Implicit formulation; Low-complexity; Multihop; Relay stations; relays; Reuse distance; Subframe structures; Subscriber stations; Transmission mode; Worldwide interoperability for microwave access; Wimax","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78751666260"

Deletion of the tdd7 gene induced a reduction of growth in liquid medium, wrinkling of the mycelium on solid medium, and poor spore and actinorhodin production. On the other hand, deletion of the tdd13 gene did not significantly affect growth in liquid medium but induced a small colony phenotype on solid medium with abundant sporulation and overproduction of undecylprodigiosin.

Such tests are typically case-based, checking a likely error scenario or an error that has previously been identified and fixed. Coming up with good test cases is challenging, and focusing on individual tests can distract from creating tests that cover the full functionality. Axioms, known from program specification, allow for an alternative way of generating test cases, where the intended functionality is described as rules or equations that can be checked automatically. Axioms are proposed as part of the concept feature of the upcoming C++0x standard.

Those units can then be tested in isolation using automated test generation techniques and tools, such as dynamic software model checkers. We discuss preliminary experimental results showing that automatic software partitioning can significantly increase test coverage without generating too many false alarms caused by unrealistic inputs being injected at interfaces between units.

Targeting primarily for solving the well-known last mile problem for broadband access [1, 2], WMNs aim to offer high-speed coverage at a significantly lower deployment and maintenance cost. As shown in Fig. 4.1, most of the nodes are stationary in WMNs. Only a fraction of nodes have direct access, and will serve as gateways, to the Internet. In addition, several nodes serve as relays forwarding traffic from other nodes (as well as their own traffic) and maintain network-wide Internet connectivity, while the remaining nodes send frames along dynamically selected ad-hoc paths to the gateway nodes with Internet access. WMNs are preferable to existing cable/DSL based networks or wireless LANs (that provide WiFi access), due to the following advantages: (i) mesh networks are more cost-effective as service providers do not have to install a wired connection to each subscriber (20-50K per square mile to establish access, approximately 1/4 of the cost incurred in high speed cable access); (ii) mesh networks are inherently more reliable since each node has redundant paths to reach the Internet; (iii) the throughput attained by a mesh network user can be, in principle, increased through routing via multiple, bandwidth-abundant paths (in contrast, in WLANs the shared bandwidth decreases as the number of users within a HotSpot increases); and (iv) WMNs can readily extend their coverage by installing additional ad-hoc hops. Several cities are planning or have partially deployed WMNs, such as Bay Area Wireless Users Group (BAWUG) [3], Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network (CUWiN) [4], SFLan [5], SeattleWireless [6], Southampton OpenWireless Network (SOWN) [7], and Wireless Leiden (in Netherlands) [8]. The academic/research efforts are, on the other hand, represented by the MIT Roofnet project [9], the Rice University Technology for All project [10], and the MSR Self-organizing neighborhood wireless mesh networks project [1]. Although initial successes have been reported in these efforts, a number of performance related problems have also been identified. Excessive packet losses [11-13], unpredictable channel behaviors [11,12], inability to find stable and high-throughput paths [11, 12], and throughput degradation due to intra-flow and inter-flow interference [13-15] are among those most cited. All these problems are rooted in the fact that the notion of a link is no longer well-defined in wireless environments. In network theory and practice, a link is usually characterized by its bandwidth, latency, packet loss ratio and patterns. However, in a WMN, a wireless medium is shared among nodes, and the sharing range is determined by (i) several PHY/MAC attributes such as the transmit power, the carrier sense threshold, and the channel on which an interface sends/receives frames, (ii) intra- and inter-flow interference (which in turn is contingent upon how nodes and traffic are distributed in the spatial and temporal domains), and (iii) environmental factors, such as multi-path fading and shadowing effects, temperature and humidity variation, and existence of objects in between. As a result, all the definitive metrics that characterize a link are no longer well-defined for a wireless link. All the protocols that were devised, and well-suited, for wireline networks will likely yield poor performance or even fail in WMNs. For example, as shown in [11] and [16], the shortest path algorithm with the hop count as the link metric will likely identify paths that are composed of long, lossy links with low bandwidth. To solve (or at least mitigate) the above problems, one should (a) characterize how, and to what extent, wireless links are affected by PHY/MAC attributes and other environmental factors, (b) identify control knobs in the PHY/MAC layers with which the sharing range of a wireless link can be better controlled, and (c) understand the implication of making available these PHY/MAC attributes to higher-layer protocols on system performance optimization. Central to issues (a) and (b) is medium access control (MAC), while issue (c) is usually termed as cross layer design and optimization. In this chapter, we discuss the state of the art in designing and implementing MAC for WMNs in Section 4.2. In particular, we categorize existingMAC-related research into four categories: (1) controlling the sharing range of the wireless medium and increasing spatial reuse; (2) exploiting temporal/spatial diversity; (3) exploiting availability of multiple channels; and (4) exercising rate control. We also introduce in Section 4.3 a modular programming environment, termed as the Transport Device Driver (TDD), that exports the PHY/MAC attributes via well-defined APIs and facilitates cross layer design and optimization, as a case study of cross layer design and optimization. We then present various routing protocols that take advantage of PHY/MAC attributes (such as channels) for route optimization in Section 4.4. We discuss open research issues in Section 4.5.

Essentially we consider multi-hop wireless networks based on opportunity-driven multiple access (ODMA) which will be shown to reduce the overall transmission power in a system, to be resilient to shadowing and to potentially increase the coverage compared with single-hop transmission. However, for simple receivers and low user density, the actual capacity of UTRA-TDD may be marginally reduced from the maximum non-relaying capacity. This chapter begins the study of ODMA based systems by analysing the implications of relaying in a cellular scenario compared to a conventional nonrelaying system. Initially the interference is analysed by investigating the effect of reduced transmitted power resulting from reduced path loss for a link. The effect of shadowing is considered and it is shown that a relaying system is able to benefit from increased zero mean lognormal shadowing by utilising the diversity of paths available. A correlated shadowing model is developed from a previous model considering both distance and angle of arrival (Klingenbrunn and Mogensen, 1999) to include the shadowing correlation between all transceivers, as they may all be available to receive in a relaying environment. It is shown that while this affects the interference pattern the perturbation is not significant. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.","","Radio transceivers; Wireless networks; Correlated shadowing; Hybrid cellular networks; Interference patterns; Log-normal shadowing; Multihop wireless network; Opportunity driven multiple access; Shadowing correlation; Single hop transmission; Peer to peer networks","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928278562"

Each proposed scheme can be applied to the measurement procedure for the possible handover scenarios to GSM and 1.28 Mcps TDD mode using different frequency band from original 1.28 Mcps TDD mode, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed structures attain the longer measurement time for target system to enhance the reliability of measurement or increase the probability of successful synchronization for handover.

The approach is based on students contributing programming problems to an open source web-based system that is used for student practice and instructor assessment of assignments. WeBWorK, and some of the latest web-based systems, use a mechanism based on unit testing to account for variation in the way in which the same problem can be answered in an accurate manner, making such systems highly appealing for education. Tackling open-ended programming problems within WeBWorK therefore requires students to write a code fragment that is then checked for semantic correctness. Given that WeBWorK is open source, the teaching approach that we have evolved revolves around students creating their own problems for other students to practice with. This requires students to construct comprehensive unit tests that can assure botii the usability and accuracy of their work prior to deployment. The paper describes this approach, gives examples of student work, presents findings from the experience of using the approach in the classroom, and discusses broader lessons and reasons for integrating software quality assurance practices into the computer science curriculum.

Therefore the effective directionally-launching-gain of the Smart Antenna will come to zero and the desired objective of isolating multi-user interference via space division multiple access can't be realized either. Additionally, it proves the unavailability of the Smart Antenna in the TD-SCDMA standard in several other ways, such as the TD-SCDMA system features, the possibility of forming multiple-direction beam by the Smart Antenna in the same time, and the rationality of the directional line array Smart Antenna.","Directional pattern; Self-interference; Smart antenna; Space division multiple access","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34548640159"

We describe an algorithm for taking time-synchronized samples of single-phase voltage and current power signals and calculating their dynamic parameters, in particular the signal magnitude, phase, frequency, and rate of change of frequency that a PMU reports. PMUs must time stamp their values at periodic Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) markers called the update times. Thus, to provide a reference for PMU testing the sampled data can be fit to a model to define the value of a dynamic parameter at a specific time. The analysis model proposed in this paper assumes that the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters of the signals are constant over the sampling interval analyzed. This analysis interval is usually the same as the update period or an integer multiple of that period. In the proposed analysis model the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters are considered a polynomial in time about the update times. The order of the polynomial can be adjusted in a way that meets the needs of the signal being analyzed, yet minimizes the computational effort and sensitivity to noise. We show that when the dynamic variations are analyzed in this way, a single matrix can be used to iteratively converge on a good estimate of the dynamic frequency and magnitude parameters. The polynomial model can be used to generate and analyze test signals. Several test patterns are proposed, which include linearly changing magnitudes or frequencies. As expected, during low voltage tests of the system, the analysis does very well when the generation model matches the analysis model. Several other generation models are also proposed, such as sine waves or damped sine waves. The proposed analysis model is shown to be very accurate in these cases as well. © 2007 IEEE.","Calibration; Dynamic measurement; Electric power grid; Global positioning system; Phase measurement; PMU; Power system reliability; Synchronization; Time- Synchronized metrology","Electric power generation; Global positioning system; Parameter estimation; Phase measurement; Statistical tests; Synchronization; Coordinated Universal Time (UTC); Current power signals; Dynamic measurements; Electric power grids; Phasor measurement unit test systems; Power system reliability; Time Synchronized metrology; Electric variables control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-42549137266"

TXL programs are self-contained, specifying and implementing all aspects of parsing, pattern matching, transformation rules, application strategies and unparsing in a single uniform notation with no dependence on other tools or technologies. Programs are directly interpreted by the TXL processor without any compile or build step, making it particularly well suited to rapid turnaround, test-driven development.

Although manually created tests are valuable, programmers often overlook some special test inputs. If programmers write down specifications, special or common tests can be automatically generated and selected by tools. However, specifications are not commonly written in practice. This research develops a novel approach for automatically identifying common and special unit tests for a class without requiring any specification. Given a class, our approach automatically generates test inputs and identifies common and special tests among the generated tests. Programmers can inspect these identified tests and use them to augment existing (manual) tests. Our approach is based on statistical algebraic abstractions, program properties (in the form of algebraic specifications) dynamically inferred from test executions. We use statistical algebraic abstractions to characterize program behavior. A test is identified to be common if the test exercises a behavior that is universally or commonly exercised by generated tests, or to be special if the test violates a behavior that is commonly exercised by generated tests.","","Abstracting; Algebra; Automation; Computer systems programming; Object oriented programming; Specifications; Testing; Algebraic specifications; Automatic identification; Automatically generated; Class under tests; Program behavior; Program properties; Special objects; Test execution; Test inputs; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79951752152"

MRM involves a multiple regression of a response matrix on any number of explanatory matrices, where each matrix contains distances or similarities (in terms of ecological, spatial, or other attributes) between all pair-wise combinations of n objects (sample units); tests of statistical significance are performed by permutation. The method is flexible in terms of the types of data that may be analyzed (counts, presence-absence, continuous, categorical) and the shapes of response curves. MRM offers several advantages over traditional partial Mantel analysis: (1) separating environmental distances into distinct distance matrices allows inferences to be made at the level of individual variables; (2) nonparametric or nonlinear multiple regression methods may be employed; and (3) spatial autocorrelation may be quantified and tested at different spatial scales using a series of lag matrices, each representing a geographic distance class. The MRM lag matrices model may be parameterized to yield very similar inferences regarding spatial autocorrelation as the Mantel correlogram. Unlike the correlogram, however, the lag matrices model may also include environmental distance matrices, so that spatial patterns in species abundance distances (community similarity) may be quantified while controlling for the environmental similarity between sites. Examples of spatial analyses with MRM are presented. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Community similarity; Distance matrix; Mantel correlogram; Multivariate analysis; Partial Mantel test; Spatial autocorrelation","abundance index; autocorrelation; community structure; multiple regression; multivariate analysis; numerical model; similarity index; spatial analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33846126538"

The development methodology proposed in this paper adapts agile principles and patterns to support the building of embedded control systems, focusing on the issues relating to a system's constraints and safety. Strong unit testing, to ensure correctness, including the satisfaction of timing constraints, is the foundation of the proposed methodology. A platform-based design approach is used to balance costs and time-to-market in relation to performance and functionality constraints. It is concluded that the proposed methodology significantly reduces design time and costs, as well as leading to better software modularity and reliability. © 2008 IEEE.","","Constraint theory; Discrete time control systems; Embedded systems; Real time systems; Embedded control systems; Functionality constraints; Software modularity; Software design","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-44149119116"

System tests are effective at exercising complex usage patterns. Differential unit tests (DUT) are a hybrid of unit and system tests. They are generated by carving the system components, while executing a system test case, that influence the behavior of the target unit, and then re-assembling those components so that the unit can be exercised as it was by the system test. We conjecture that DUTs retain some of the advantages of unit tests, can be automatically and inexpensively generated, and have the potential for revealing faults related to intricate system executions. In this paper we present a framework for automatically carving and replaying DUTs that accounts for a wide-variety of strategies, we implement an instance of the framework with several techniques to mitigate test cost and enhance flexibility, and we empirically assess the efficacy of carving and replaying DUTs.

Although the FP units' complex structure consists of classic integer arithmetic components, the embedded components encounter serious testability problems due to their limited accessibility from the FP unit ports and testability loss due to FP unit inherent operations, such as rounding and normalization. In this paper, we analyze the testability problems and present scalable test generation for FP units using as a demonstration vehicle the popular, high-speed, two-path architecture of the most complex unit, the FP adder. The key feature of the presented methodology is the identification of testability conditions that guarantee effective test pattern application and fault propagation for each of the components of the FP adder. The identified test conditions can be utilized with respect to any fault model and are independent of the internal structure and the size of the components. Thus, they can be applied to FP adders of various exponent and significand sizes (single, double, and custom precision), as well as to other types of FP units, which also consist of classic integer arithmetic components similarly interconnected. © 2006 IEEE.","Datapath testing; Floating-point unit testing; Processor testing; Test generation; Testability conditions","Design for testability; Embedded systems; Integer programming; Microprocessor chips; Complex floating-point (FP); Datapath testing; Floating-piont unit testing; High-speed datapaths; Integer arithmetic components; Processor testing; Test generation; Testability conditions; Program processors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33750101203"

Browser-based interfaces incorporate rich, client-side scripting that is increasingly independent of server-side application logic. At the same time, the server side application logic interacts with reusable components for key elements (security, shopping cart, product catalog, order processing) within the framework of a component-based architecture, using beans and web services. In this paper, we illustrate how a test specification approach using a language like TTCN-3 can be used to define test cases at different levels of abstraction that are more robust in the face of volatile presentation and implementation details. A case study of a shopping cart scenario with order processing is used as an illustration. Features of TTCN-3 are demonstrated, including a powerful matching mechanism that allows a separation between behavior and the conditions governing behavior. As well, TTCN-3's data types and set-based operations allow one to track and verify the information management done by a web application, independent of implementation details. These features allow a tester to take a systematic approach to testing web applications but requires more sophistication and skills. The advantages and challenges of a test specification approach are characterized in comparison to approaches based on unit testing and test automation tools. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Component; Pattern matching; Sets; Templates; Test case; Test script; Test specification; TTCN-3","Arsenic compounds; Computer software reusability; Fuzzy logic; Industrial engineering; Information management; Information services; Management information systems; Public key cryptography; Separation; Web services; World Wide Web; Application logic; Case studies; Component-based architectures; Data typing; Evolution (CO); Functional testing (FT); Key elements; Levels of abstraction (loA); Order processing; Reusable components; SERVER side; Shopping carts; Special sections; Systematic approaches; Test Automation; Test cases; Test specification (TS); Unit testing; WEB applications; Testing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-48349118535"

The DSL supports interactive prototyping and unit testing, simplifying the process of designing efficient implementations of common patterns. Unscheduled C and scheduled assembly language output are supported. Using the patterns, even nonexpert users can write efficient function implementations, leveraging special hardware features. A production-quality library of elementary functions for the Cell BE SPU compute engines has been developed. Coconutgenerated and -scheduled vector functions were more than four times faster than commercially distributed functions written in C with intrinsics (a nicer syntax for in-line assembly), wrapped in loops and scheduled by spuxlc. All Coconut functions were faster, but the difference was larger for hard-to-approximate functions for which register-level SIMD lookups made a bigger difference. Other helpful features in the language include facilities for translating interval and polynomial descriptions between GHCi, a Haskell interpreter used to prototype in the DSL, and Maple, used for exploration and minimax polynomial generation. This makes it easier to match mathematical properties of the functions with efficient calculational patterns in the SPU ISA.

The On Board Software (OBSW) product Is always on the satellite schedule critical path due to its own features : part of all embedded functional chains, product flexibility, late modifications possibility, etc .... and also due to the fact that the product is essential to all validation phases at Avionics, AIT and ground segment level. Consequently, the validation phase is a predominant effort of the complete OBSW development cycle, where each bug detection is extremely costly. The tendency of OBSW schedule reduction and the late bug detection cost impact have been mentioned in all report on the ""software crisis"" established by ESA, CNES, NASA etc ... and are the basis of Agencies software roadmap. To answer to this problematic, several axes are investigated at ASP software level: technologies evolution, process adaptation and product line strategy. This paper talks about one of our investigation axis: introduction of an original tool to the development cycle which really permits to pass a step in term of bug anticipation. Classical tools which allow to have static information on the code or to help developer in term of unit test phase as test pattern generator, dynamic analysis are out of scope of this article. The focus is really put on the use of new tool which detects defects at the earliest stage of a project. After a first use of IABC INRIA prototype tool in the scope of Proteus project (with the CNES support), the approach of the problematic taken by this tool had kept our attention: it is naturally that the first Polyspace Verifier industrialization version has been introduced on ASP on board software development process. This paper recalls briefly the tool features and describes the advantage to introduce it in the development process, illustrated with some metrics.","","Avionics; Embedded systems; Program debugging; Project management; Risk assessment; Satellite communication systems; Space research; ASP; On Board Software (OBSW); Product flexibility; Schedule reduction; Software engineering","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-26944447135"

This architecture is motivated from the network system requirements, especially single-hop distance and jamming-resilience requirements. It is shown that the power consumption of current-day Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) limits the channel bandwidth that can be used, both for a baseband processing system and the scanning system. We therefore propose to use a form of Frequency Hopping Time Division Multiplexing (FH/TDD) system, similar to Bluetooth. However, we propose to use OFDM as modulation scheme instead of GFSK and show that the OFDM symbol length for the frequency range at hand (400 -1000 M Hz) is consistent with a Bluetooth-alike FH/TDD scheme. We propose to modify the FH/TDD scheme to incorporate a radio-spectrum measurement phase. Based on these measurements carriers in the OFDM-based scheme are selected in such a fashion that legacy users are avoided. In case of too much legacy-user spectral usage hopping patterns may be altered. © 2005 IEEE.","","Analog to digital conversion; Cognitive systems; Disaster prevention; Electric power utilization; Jamming; Legacy systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Time division multiplexing; Bluetooth; Jamming resilience; Radio spectrum measurement phase; Scanning systems; Telecommunication networks","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33749064905"

The DCXRD results reveal various dislocation configurations on both types of PSSs. The etch pits of GaN on the recess PSS exhibit a regular distribution, i.e. less etch pits or threading dislocation density (TDD) onto the recess area than those onto the sapphire mesas. On the contrary, an irregular distribution is observed for the etch pits of GaN on the protruding PSS. A higher crystal quality of the GaN epilayer grown onto the recess PSS can be achieved as compared with that onto the protruding PSS. These data reflect that the GaN epilayer on the recess PSS could be a better template for the second epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) of GaN.

The process of maintaining and updating the network models for EMS & BMS applications became more challenged and cumbersome for our engineers to support. These challenges are becoming more relevant as the NYISO grids are becoming more congested with rapidly changing power flow patterns responding to market conditions. The NYISO's network models cover the entire New York state with about 3100 buses, 30/70 split between internal/external and 40 AGC tie lines to other ISOs such as PJM, ISONE, IMO & HQ and all the 69KV and above systems. Currently, there are eight Transmission Owners and 400 plus Market Participants that participate in our markets. As part of the SMD-2's requirements, which were successfully implemented in December 2005, the NYISO consolidated all the SCADA, EMS & BMS applications to run under one single platform and that is ABB's Ranger Systems. To maximize the convergence and improve the solutions between the SCADA, EMS and BMS applications, network models for various applications on different platforms were also consolidated into a single model and that in turn drives all the applications including the Dispatcher Training Simulator. CIM Data Engineering Toolkit: ABB's Ranger System that utilized the CIM DE Toolkit, an Oracle based program, was selected and used to maintain and update the network model. The CIM Toolkit features a graphical editing environment to manage data in a CIM-based format, including automatic diagram generation, and multi-user, versioned editing. The CIM DE Toolkit includes tools for the import and export of CPSM-compliant full and incremental CIM/XML data as well as the comparison of existing models to CIM/XML data. The CIM database contains not only the network model data such as breakers, generators, lines, transformers, shunts, SVCs, Statcom, loads and others but also contains the SCADA data as well as Seasonal and Dynamic equipment ratings. The CIM database also contains PI data definition, and other data that are required to drive the Control Center Map board. In addition to standard data requirements for EMS applications, there are a few special data that are required for BMS applications such as Equipment Outage Priority, Load Pocket Definition, Facility Monitored and Secured flags and others. Network Model Update: The network model update is being initiated by the Market Participants, Transmission Owners, and internally. Various processes were implemented to ensure that appropriate upgrade and newly added equipments and associated measurements were notified in a timely manner by the Transmission Owners so that they can be reflected in the CIM database for all applications. Currently, network data updates are being reported to the NYISO through the one-line station diagrams, and text files, since most of the TOs do not have the tools to generate either full or incremental CIM-XML files from their EMS systems. The External Control Area network updates are being requested on a needed basis. The NYISO has been providing the full net work model in the standard CIM-XML file to other neighboring ISOs and Transmission Owners. Currently, the CIM-XML Extension, which was created directly from the DE Toolkit, is being used to generate the Ranger Run-Time for BMS applications on a monthly basis. Data Exchanged between EMS. BMS and others applications: In addition to the Load Forecast and generator bid data, which was provided from other applications based on different platforms, BMS applications also acquire other data directly from the EMS system such as Contingency Definition, Contingency Group, Security Monitor Flags, Branch Group flags, Incremental Limit Change Table flags, EMS load patterns, EMS external generator schedules, Equipment Outage Priority, Regulation and reserve requirement. The data is being exchanged between SCADA, EMS and BMS applications in real time and on exception. The key that allows all data being exchanged among applications is the PTID number, a unique ID that was assigned to each piece of the network equipments and other Control Area related definitions. Network Model Validation: Unlike other ISO's where different groups within the organization handle the physical and financial models, the NYISO designates just one department to handle all the network modeling and validation processes. All the network model data unit validation is being performed on the development servers, where the live-data is fed directly from the Production System. Benchmark tests can be performed in parallel against the Production Systems. The following applications are be validated once the new run-time database is created: SCADA system, EMS - State Estimator, Contingency Analysis, Dispatcher Load Flow, Security Monitor, AGC and BMS - Real Time Commitment, Real-Time Dispatch, and Security Constrained Unit Commitment (Day Ahead Evaluation software). Once the unit tests are completed, then the final model is further validated in the QA department for System Integration bid-to-bill testing. The network model is being updated to the Production System on a one to two month basis. ©2007 IEEE.","","Competitive intelligence; Electric lines; Mathematical models; Real time systems; Business Management Systems (BMS); Energy Management System (EMS); Standard Market Design (SMD-2); Energy management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-42649142266"

We start the course with two weeks of controlled lab exercises designed to teach the students about test driven development in JUnit/Eclipse and designing for testability (with the humble dialog box design pattern) while practicing pair programming. The rest of our semester is spent in three four-week iterations developing a product for a customer. Our teams are generally large (14-16 students) so that the projects can be large enough to motivate the use of configuration management and defect tracking tools. The requirement of pair programming limits the amount of project work the students can do outside of class, so class time is spent on the projects and teaching is on-demand individual mentoring with lectures/labs inserted as necessary. One significant challenge in managing this course is tracking individual responsibilities and activities to ensure that all of the students are fully engaged in the project. To accomplish this, we have modified the story and task cards from XP to provide feedback to the students and track individual performance against goals as part of the students' grades. The resulting course has been well received by the students. This paper will describe this course in more detail and assess its effect on students' software engineering background through students' feedback and code metrics. © 2005 IEEE.","About four, - Agile methodology; Extreme programming; Software engineering education","Customer satisfaction; Design for testability; Engineering education; Iterative methods; Software engineering; Structured programming; Students; Agile methodology; Extreme Programming (XP); Iteration Planning Game; Pair programming; Project management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33947248135"

In population pharmacokinetic analyses of such TDM data, CL has frequently been modeled as a function of dose. This paper demonstrates by simulation methodology that the TDM process does indeed introduce a correlation between dose and CL which can be interpreted as a nonlinearity. Using literature values of carbamazepine pharmacokinetics, three steady-state concentrations were simulated following a standard 1000 mg total daily dose (TDD) regimen in 100 in silico subjects. A set of clinical rules was established to adjust the TDD based on these three concentrations, as might be done in the clinical setting. Another set of concentrations using these TDM-derived TDDs for each subject (600-1600 mg) was simulated. A standard population pharmacokinetic analysis of the post-TDM data was conducted using NONMEM. This process was replicated 100 times to estimate the type II error rate. When CL was modeled without TDD, plots of WRES versus PRED demonstrated a clear pattern, as did the delta plots of CL (CL minus TVCL) versus TDD, suggesting the covariate TDD should be incorporated into the model. After TDD was included in the model for CL, the objective function value decreased by an average of 75.7 (p < 0.001). In addition, the inter-individual variability in CL expressed as a coefficient of variation decreased by an average of 9.9% and the diagnostic plots improved. Although CL was simulated to be independent of TDD, it was identified as an important covariate using standard approaches in a simulated TDM setting in 100% of the replicated simulation studies. The TDM process introduces a correlation between CL and TDD that can be misinterpreted as nonlinearity in the system. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Carbamazepine; Nonlinear pharmacokinetics; Population pharmacokinetics; Therapeutic drug monitoring","Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Analysis of Variance; Carbamazepine; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Monitoring; Humans; Linear Models; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Reproducibility of Results; Statistics; carbamazepine; adult; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; correlation analysis; drug monitoring; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical literature; methodology; molecular model; population research; priority journal; seizure; standardization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-28944452426"

In the TDD-CDMA system, the transmission for asymmetric traffic from neighboring cells may cause the cross-slot interference, which can seriously degrade system capacity. To avoid the cross-slot interference for TDD-CDMA systems, many current resource allocation algorithms typically require a global control on the transmission direction (either downlink or uplink) in each time slot. Apparently, this requirement substantially constrains the flexibility of TDD-CDMA systems to deliver asymmetric traffic services in a more practical situation where every cell may have different uplink and downlink bandwidth requirements. We analyze the interference of the TDD-CDMA system with a trisector cellular architecture, where three directional antennas are employed at each base station. We find that the directivity of directional antennas can provide an additional degree of freedom for allocating radio resource. Taking advantage of this property, we introduce the concept of virtual cell, defined as the same converge area of a cell but is composed of three sectors from the three adjacent base stations. Furthermore, we propose a new virtual cell-based distributed code/time slot allocation algorithm to enable a TDD-CDMA system to provide asymmetric services with different rates of asymmetry in every cell coverage area. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm does not only offer more flexibility in handling nonuniform traffic patterns, but maintain good radio link performance and call blocking performance. © 2005 IEEE.","Code division multiple access (CDMA); Opposition direction interference; Resource allocation; Time duplex division (TDD)","Algorithms; Antennas; Bandwidth; Code division multiple access; Computer simulation; Radio interference; Radio links; Telecommunication traffic; Cross slot interference; Opposition direction interference; Time division duplex (TDD); Mobile telecommunication systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-21244506265"

This system, which will operate in the L frequency band (960 to 1164 MHz), would be internationally deployed from 2020. Many technologies were considered for this new aeronautical system but only two among them were preselected by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO): candidate one, named L-DACS1, is based on a FDD-OFDM technology and candidate two, named L-DACS2, is based on a TDD-GMSK technology. One of the most important issues for both candidates is the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with the legacy systems operating in the same band or/and in adjacent bands. Different scenarios have to be evaluated due to the fact that these systems will be implanted either in the airplanes (on board) or in ground stations. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the air-air scenario, where we focus on the signals generated by onboard L-DACS transmitters on onboard victim receivers, taking into account the L-DACS antenna radiation pattern and the frequency mask.

It is important for the reliability of these containers that they are tested adequately. We describe techniques for automated test input generation of Java container classes. Test inputs are sequences of method calls from the container interface. The techniques rely on state matching to avoid generation of redundant tests. Exhaustive techniques use model checking with explicit or symbolic execution to explore all the possible test sequences up to predefined input sizes. Lossy techniques rely on abstraction mappings to compute and store abstract versions of the concrete states; they explore underapproximations of all the possible test sequences. We have implemented the techniques on top of the Java PathFinder model checker and we evaluate them using four Java container classes. We compare state matching based techniques and random selection for generating test inputs, in terms of testing coverage. We consider basic block coverage and a form of predicate coverage - that measures whether all combinations of a predetermined set of predicates are covered at each basic block. The exhaustive techniques can easily obtain basic block coverage, but cannot obtain good predicate coverage before running out of memory. On the other hand, abstract matching turns out to be a powerful approach for generating test inputs to obtain high predicate coverage. Random selection performed well except on the examples that contained complex input spaces, where the lossy abstraction techniques performed better.

Intuitively, a step-by-step approach might seem more practical; however, XP practices are heavily intertwined and mutually dependent, creating problems in terms of prioritizing and justifying one instructional sequence over another. We propose a way to technically analyze the complex interrelationships between XP practices by identifying cluster patterns. These patterns can then be used to assist us in sequencing the introduction XP practices, helping both inexperienced teams and classroom learners in using XP.

Bluetooth hosts are not able to communicate unless they have previously discovered each other through synchronization of their timing and frequency-hopping patterns. Thus, even if all nodes are within proximity of each other, only those nodes which are synchronized with the transmitter can hear the transmission. To support any-to-any communication, nodes must be synchronized so that the pairs of nodes, which can communicate with each other, form a connected graph. Using Bluetooth as an example, we first provide deeper insights into the issue of link establishment in frequency-hopping wireless systems. We then introduce an asynchronous distributed protocol that begins with nodes having no knowledge of their surroundings and terminates with the formation of a connected network topology satisfying all constraints posed by Bluetooth. An attractive protocol feature is its ease in implementation using the communication primitives offered by the Bluetooth Specification. © 2005 IEEE.","Bluetooth; Frequency hopping; Scatternet; Topology construction","Broadcasting; Frequency hopping; Laptop computers; Local area networks; Mathematical models; Network protocols; Personal digital assistants; Telecommunication networks; Topology; Transmitters; Bluetooth; Piconets; Scatternet; Time divison duplex (TDD); Topology construction; Mobile telecommunication systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-15244359199"

It is time consuming and tedious to write unit tests, and it is especially difficult to write unit tests that model the pattern of usage of the application they will be used in. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) addresses the problem of separation of concerns in programs which is well suited to unit test problems. What's more, unit tests should be made from different concerns in the application instead of just from functional assertions of correctness or error. In this paper, we firstly present a new concept, application-specific Aspects, which mean top-level aspects picked up from generic low-level aspects in AOP for specific use. It can be viewed as the separation of concerns on applications of generic low-level aspects. Second, this paper describes an Aspect-Oriented Test Description Language (AOTDL) and techniques to build top-level aspects for testing on generic aspects. Third, we generate JUnit unit testing framework and test oracles from AspectJ programs by integrating our tool with AspectJ and JUnit. We use runtime exceptions thrown by testing aspects to decide whether methods work well. Finally, we present a double-phase testing way to filter out meaningless test cases in our framework. © 2004 IEEE.","","Codes (symbols); Error analysis; Mathematical models; Object oriented programming; Problem solving; Regression analysis; Aspect-oriented programming (AOP); Automated generation; Commercial tools; Extreme programming (XP); Computer programming languages","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-18944404257"

Methods and Results: Escherichia coli, Salmonella and F-specific RNA bacteriophage were enumerated in sludge and amended soil. Salmonella was not detected and only small numbers of bacteriophages were found in conventional, dewatered mesophilic anaerobically digested biosolids (DMAD). Neither organism was detected in soil. Escherichia coli numbers in soil increased with DMAD application compared with the unamended control, or soil receiving enhanced treated, thermally dried digested (TDD) and composted (CPT) biosolids. Empirical statistical models were developed summarizing the relationship between soil temperature, moisture content and time and E. coli populations. Background numbers of E. coli declined with increasing soil temperature and decreasing soil moisture responding to seasonal patterns in environmental conditions. Time following application was the only significant explanatory variable of E. coli numbers and decay in DMAD-amended soil. Conclusions: E. coli are an indigenous component of the microbial community in field soil and populations increased in cool, moist soil during autumn-winter and declined in warm, dryer soil during spring-summer. Enhanced treated biosolids were not a source of E. coli, but reduced the size of the indigenous population possibly by stimulating the activity of predatory and competing soil flora because of the organic substrate input from sludge. Conventionally treated biosolids increased E. coli numbers in soil. However, introduced bacteria declined rapidly and survival was limited to 3 months, irrespective of the timing of sludge application or environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results provide assurance that residual numbers of pathogens applied to soil in treated biosolids decay to background values well within cropping and harvesting restrictions imposed when sewage sludge is spread on farmland. © 2007 The Authors.","Agriculture; Biosolids; Decay; E. coli; Enteric; Pathogens; Sewage sludge; Soil","Escherichia coli; Salmonella; Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Bacteriophages; Biosolids; Population statistics; Salmonella; Sewage sludge; Soil moisture; Temperature; Agricultural soils; Amended soil; Decay; E. coli; Enteric; Environmental conditions; Field investigation; Mesophilic; Micro-organisms; Soil temperature; agricultural soil; bacteriophage; biosolid; coliform bacterium; microbial community; RNA; soil amendment; soil biota; survival; activated sludge; agricultural species; article; bacterial survival; bacteriophage; biosolid; composting; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli; moisture; nonhuman; Salmonella; sludge; soil microflora; soil moisture; soil temperature; spring; summer; Escherichia coli","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35448949627"

Tissue equivalent breast phantoms simulating an adipose to glandular ratio of 50/50, 30/70, and 20/80 were imaged according to each manufacturers' recommendation with four full-field digital mammography units (Fuji, Sectra, Fischer, and General Electric) and a screen-film mammography unit (MammoMatII 2000, Siemens, Munich, Germany). A total of 20 images were obtained in both hard- and soft-copy formats. For the purpose of soft-copy display, the screen-film hard-copy images were digitized with a 50 μm micron scanner. Six radiologists, experts in breast imaging, and three physicists, experts in scoring mammography phantoms, participated in a reader study where each reader scored each phantom for visibility of line-pairs and for 24 objects (fibers, clusters of specks, and masses). The data were recorded, entered into a database, and analyzed by a mixed-effect model. The limiting spatial resolution in line-pairs per millimeter visible with the digital units was less, regardless of display modality used, than that provided by the screen-film unit. The difference was statistically significant for the General Electric (p < 0.01) and Fuji digital mammography units (p=0.03). With respect to the number of visible objects, a statistically significant higher number could be detected with the screen-film unit as compared to the Fischer (p<0.01) and Sectra (p < 0.01) digital mammography units, but there was no significant difference between the other digital units and screen film. Overall, there was significantly better performance on the 50/50 phantom than with the 30/70 and 20/80 phantoms (p =0.01, p < 0.01) for object visibility. For the digital mammography units, soft-copy display performed better than hard-copy display for the Fischer and Sectra images, but worse for Fuji and General Electric. In addition, soft-copy display of digitized screen-film images was significantly better than hard-copy display (p=0.02) of the original screen films for object visibility, but worse for spatial resolution. The higher contrast resolution of the FFDM units tested did not result in improved detection of line-pair resolution or objects in the phantoms tested versus screen-film mammography. The phantom performance of a digital mammography unit seems to be influenced by the type of detection task (line-pair resolution versus object visibility), the display modality (soft-copy versus hard-copy) chosen to score the phantoms, and the parenchymal pattern composition of the phantom. © 2005 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","","Image resolution; Medical imaging; Object detection; Phantoms; Tissue; Visibility; Contrast resolution; Digital mammography; Full field digital mammography; Improved contrasts; Mixed-effect models; Parenchymal patterns; Screen-film mammographies; Spatial resolution; adipose tissue; apparatus; article; breast; contrast enhancement; data analysis; data base; digital radiography; film; full field digital mammography; human; image analysis; image display; image enhancement; image quality; image reconstruction; intermethod comparison; mammary gland; mammography; model; normal human; parenchyma; phantom; priority journal; radiologist; scoring system; screen film mammography; simulation; Mammography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-27244459487"

The metering units included a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the standard cell corn plate, a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the flat plate, and a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus row unit with the finger pick-up metering system. Planter seed spacing uniformity was measured using three parameters: ISO Miss index, ISO Multiples index, and Coefficient of Precision (CP3). Six replications for nine field slope treatments were conducted for each metering unit. The field slope treatments included: front-up (front of planter unit), front-down, right-up (right side of planter unit), and left-up (left side of the planter unit) each at field slope levels of 10% and 20%, and level. Slope and travel pattern had significant effects on the seed spacing uniformity for each of the three metering units tested. The finger pick-up was the least affected by slope as only the treatment of front-up at 20% slope had significantly worse seed spacing uniformity than the level treatment. For the cell plate metering unit, seed spacing uniformity was best with the planter on a level surface, or with the uphill-downhill travel pattern on a 10% slope, and on a 20% slope the uphill-downhill travel pattern had better seed spacing uniformity than the on-the-contour travel pattern. The finger pick-up metering unit had equally good seed spacing uniformity on a level surface and with either travel pattern on the 10% slope. On a 20% slope, the finger pick-up metering unit had better seed spacing uniformity with the on-the-contour travel pattern than with the uphill-downhill travel pattern. The flat plate metering unit had its best seed spacing uniformity with the front up on a 10% slope, followed by equivalent seed spacing uniformity between right up on a 10% slope and on a level surface.

The technique takes a program or software component, plus a set of correct executionssay, from observations of the software running properly, or from an existing test suite that a user wishes to enhance. The technique first infers an operational model of the software's operation. Then, inputs whose operational pattern of execution differs from the model in specific ways are suggestive of faults. These inputs are further reduced by selecting only one input per operational pattern. The result is a small portion of the original inputs, deemed by the technique as most likely to reveal faults. Thus, the technique can also be seen as an error-detection technique. The paper describes two additional techniques that complement test input selection. One is a technique for automatically producing an oracle (a set of assertions) for a test input from the operational model, thus transforming the test input into a test case. The other is a classification-guided test input generation technique that also makes use of operational models and patterns. When generating inputs, it filters out code sequences that are unlikely to contribute to legal inputs, improving the efficiency of its search for fault-revealing inputs. We have implemented these techniques in the Eclat tool, which generates unit tests for Java classes. Eclat's input is a set of classes to test and an example program execution - say, a passing test suite. Eclat's output is a set of JUnit test cases, each containing a potentially fault-revealing input and a set of assertions at least one of which fails.

This paper proposes an approach to generating test cases automatically for the unit test of C programs with derived types including pointers, structures and arrays. Our approach combines symbolic execution and concrete execution. The approach captures operations on variables precisely by concrete execution, and thus it is capable of handling derived types. Benefited from symbolic execution, accessing variables as array index can be solved by a substitution strategy. The substitution strategy also translates a path constraint involving variables of derived type to the one containing only primitive variables. An implementation of this approach is integrated into our test case generation tool called CAUT 1.Experimental results show that our approach is effective to generate test data for derived types. © 2009 IEEE.","","C (programming language); Computer software selection and evaluation; Data communication systems; Software engineering; Software testing; Test facilities; Testing; C programs; Path constraint; Primitive variables; Symbolic execution; Test case; Test case generation; Test data; Test data generation; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-71049164564"

However, generation of the test scenarios is usually a manual and labor-intensive task. It is often desired that test scenarios can be automatically generated. As a semi-formal modeling language, UML is widely used in both academia research and industry practice to describe analysis and design specifications. The UML activity diagrams (ADs) are mainly used in business logic processing at the early stage of software development life-cycle. Obviously, testing scenarios generated from ADs can contribute to test driven development. Nevertheless, it is difficult to automatically generate test scenarios from ADs which contains fork-join pairs mixed with loops and branches. In this paper, a systematic approach is proposed to automatically generate test scenarios from the UML activity diagrams which may contain complicated fork-join structure.","Scenarios; Testing; UML activity diagram","Arsenic; Computer programming languages; Computer science; Computer software selection and evaluation; Computers; Graphic methods; Life cycle; Software testing; Systems analysis; Test facilities; Testing; Unified Modeling Language; Analysis and designs; Automatically generate; Automatically generated; Business logics; Early stages; Formal modeling languages; Industry practices; Scenarios; Software developments; Systematic approaches; Test scenarios; UML activity diagram; UML activity diagrams; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-56149118523"

However, the cross-slot interference is caused by the asymmetry traffic between mobile subscribers and base stations, which can seriously degrade the system performance. In this paper, an efficient dynamic channel assignment with channel locked (DCA/CL) is investigated for TDD-CDMA communication systems. The cell is divided into three sections by directional antennas. The above tri-sector cell architecture possesses additional orthogonality inherently due to the directivity of directional antenna, which can provide an additional degree of freedom in allocating radio resource with the channel locked directly in the section of the neighbor cell. Further, the proposed scheme is combined with transmission power control to decrease the interference, and is also evaluated by computer simulation. The results show it efficiently reduces the failure probability and achieves better system performance. ©2008 IEEE.","CDMA; DCA; TDD","Code division multiple access; Communication systems; Computational methods; Computer networks; Computer simulation; Concurrency control; Directional patterns (antenna); CDMA; DCA; Directional antennas; TDD; Time division multiplexing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-50649102139"

These distinctions are increasingly important as software becomes prevalent in the design tools and products of other engineering disciplines. By considering what is similar and what is different we help reveal how the lessons of software design may help other disciplines, and vice versa. This in turn illuminates a core meta-question of how educators in academia and industry can help evolve our understanding of what we do so that we can be more effective at software design.

Across CN subdivisions, the proportional representation of frequencies differed. A striking result was the substantial number of units tuned to frequencies <23 kHz. Across frequency bands, temporal response patterns, latency, and spontaneous discharge differed. For example, the 23- to 30-kHz representation, which comprises the fundamental of the sonar call, had an unusually high proportion of units with onset responses (39%) and low spontaneous rates (53%). Units tuned to 58-59 kHz, corresponding to the sharply tuned cochlear resonance, had slightly but significantly longer latencies than other bands. In units tuned to frequencies >30 kHz, 31% displayed a secondary excitatory peak, usually between 10 and 22 kHz. The secondary peak may originate in cochlear mechanisms for some units, but in others it may result from convergent input onto CN neurons. In 20% of units tested with two-tone stimuli, suppression of best frequency (BF) responses was tuned at least an octave below BF. These properties may underlie similar IC responses. However, other forms of spectral interaction present in IC were absent in CN: we found no facilitatory combination-sensitive interactions and very few combination-sensitive inhibitory interactions of the dominant IC type in which inhibition was tuned to 23-30 kHz. Such interactions arise above CN. Distinct forms of spectral integration thus originate at different levels of the ascending auditory pathway.

The suffix tree is a versatile data structure that can be used to evaluate a wide variety of queries on sequence datasets, including evaluating exact and approximate string matches, and finding repeat patterns. However, methods for constructing suffix trees are often very time-consuming, especially for suffix trees that are large and do not fit in the available main memory. Even when the suffix tree fits in memory, it turns out that the processor cache behavior of theoretically optimal suffix tree construction methods is poor, resulting in poor performance. Currently, there are a large number of algorithms for constructing suffix trees, but the practical tradeoffs in using these algorithms for different scenarios are not well characterized. In this paper, we explore suffix tree construction algorithms over a wide spectrum of data sources and sizes. First, we show that on modern processors, a cache-efficient algorithm with O(n 2) worst-case complexity outperforms popular linear time algorithms like Ukkonen and McCreight, even for in-memory construction. For larger datasets, the disk I/O requirement quickly becomes the bottleneck in each algorithm's performance. To address this problem, we describe two approaches. First, we present a buffer management strategy for the O(n 2) algorithm. The resulting new algorithm, which we call ""Top Down Disk-based"" (TDD), scales to sizes much larger than have been previously described in literature. This approach far outperforms the best known disk-based construction methods. Second, we present a new disk-based suffix tree construction algorithm that is based on a sort-merge paradigm, and show that for constructing very large suffix trees with very little resources, this algorithm is more efficient than TDD. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Sequence matching; Suffix tree construction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-25844465842"

The revival of interest in testing tools and techniques follows in particular from the popularity of ""Test-Driven Development""; rigorous specification and proofs have, for their part, also made considerable progress. There remains, however, a fundamental superiority of specifications over test: you can derive tests from a specification, but not the other way around. Contract-Driven Development is a new approach to systematic software construction combining ideas from Design by Contract, from TestDriven Development, from work on formal methods, and from advances in automatic testing as illustrated for example in our AutoTest tool. Like TDD it gives tests a central role in the development process, but these tests are deduced from possibly partial specifications (contracts) and directly supported by the development environment.

It helps to solve the dead-spots problem and to ease congestion in hotspots. However, to obtain good performance of multi-hop relaying, an effective channel assignment scheme is needed. In this paper, we study the design goals of a good channel assignment scheme. We then propose a channel assignment scheme, called Extended Delay-Sensitive Slot Assignment (E-DSSA), which achieves all these goals. The distinctive feature of E-DSSA is the use of a novel transmission zone testing technique which allows high flexibility and precision in channel assignment in TDD W-CDMA multi-hop cellular environment. Performance evaluation shows that E-DSSA outperforms its existing counterparts in terms of data throughput with low delay for both sparse and dense networks. E-DSSA is also shown to adapt to different cell sizes achieving high throughput and call acceptance ratios.

Coarser granularity tests, however, are necessary to validate the behavior of larger software components, and are also likely to be more robust in the presence of program changes. This paper investigates whether coarser granularity tests can be automatically generated by aggregating unit tests. We leverage our Differential Unit Test (DUT) framework to represent unit tests, define a space of potential aggregations of those unit tests, and implement a strategy to traverse that space to generate Aggregated DUTs (A-DUTs) that validate the effects of multiple method calls on a (set of) receiver object(s). An empirical study of A-DUTs on two applications shows their tradeoffs with DUTs and their potential to increase the number of versions for which tests remain usable relative to method level tests. © 2008 IEEE.","","Agglomeration; Software engineering; Software testing; Soil structure interactions; Testing; Automatic generations; Automatically generated; Differential unit tests; Empirical studies; Multiple methods; Software components; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-56249086894"

Testing can be used to help assure both the correctness and robustness of a web service. Because manual testing is tedious, tools are needed to automate test generation and execution for web services. This paper presents a framework and its supporting tool for automatically generating and executing web-service requests and analyzing the subsequent request-response pairs. Given a service provider's Web Service Description Language (WSDL) specification, we first automatically generate necessary Java code to implement a client (service requestor). We then leverage automated unit test generation tools for Java to generate unit tests (including extreme, special, and random input values), and execute the generated unit tests, which in turn invoke the service under test. Finally we analyze the large number of request-response pairs from the web service invocation and identify robustness problems. We have applied our framework to freely available web services and our experiences show that we can quickly generate and execute web-service requests that may reveal robustness problems with no knowledge of the underlying web service implementation. © 2007 IEEE.","","Automatic test pattern generation; Computer programming languages; Industry; Information services; Java programming language; Software testing; Testing; Tools; World Wide Web; Applied (CO); Automated testing; international conferences; Java codes; Random input; Response analysis; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Service provider (SP); Service requestors; Supporting tool; Test generations; unit testing; Web service description language (WSDL); Web service invocation; Web services; Web services","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-46849084352"

In this context, co-channel interference may arise in high levels compromising the system's capacity and robust operation. Interference is further increased when limited directionality terminal antennas are employed to support non line-of-sight operation and in the case where an adaptive-time division duplex is selected for efficient radio resource management in asymmetric and time-varying traffic conditions. In this paper frequency channel assignment (CA) and antenna polarization assignment (PA) are considered as a means of mitigating interference. Two novel CA schemes that consider the distinct characteristics of F-BWA are proposed; the rotated-interleaved channel assignment and the non-uniform channel assignment. According to statistical interference simulation analysis the proposed schemes are more efficient in suppressing interference, achieving higher capacity compared to existing schemes while incurring no further complexity. In addition, instead of exploiting the performance of CA and PA schemes independently a framework for a joint CA-PA consideration is presented, where for a particular CA scheme an optimized PA pattern is developed. Results show that this approach improves the CA-PA interoperability increasing the overall performance. The efficiency of the proposed schemes is investigated for both FDD and adaptive-TDD schemes and is verified for various sectorization, frequency re-use and terminal antenna directivity configurations to ensure compatibility with different deployment scenarios. © Springer 2006.","Channel assignment; Fixed-broadband wireless access; Frequency planning; Polarization assignment","Adaptive systems; Broadband networks; Channel capacity; Robustness (control systems); Telecommunication traffic; Time division multiple access; Channel assignment; Fixed-broadband wireless access; Frequency planning; Polarization assignment; Wireless telecommunication systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33744786563"

In a previous study, l-acetylcarnitine (l-Ac), a substance known to potentiate recurrent inhibition in humans was found to alter, in a specific way, the discharge variability, and the synchronous activity of motor units depending on the presence or absence of recurrent inhibition in the corresponding motoneuron pool. Using a similar paradigm, we have recorded the tonic discharge activity of motor unit pairs from the masseter muscle during voluntary isometric contraction while subjects were undergoing continuous intravenous saline (SAL, NaCl 0.9%) perfusion. Following a brief baseline-recording period, the subjects were given a test injection of either l-Ac or isotonic saline (SAL) in a double blind manner. The variability, synchronization, and coherence between the motor unit discharges were analysed during three successive periods: pre-injection, during injection, and post-injection, each lasting 2-3 min. Neither l-Ac nor SAL injection induced a significant change in the inter-spike interval (ISI) or the coefficient of variation of the ISIs in the motor units tested. There were also no significant changes in the pattern of synchronous activity or in the coherence, which reflects the common frequency content of the unit discharges. Reminiscent of what had been observed previously with motoneurons without recurrent inhibition in the Abductor Digitorum Minimi muscle, the lack of effects of l-Ac injection on the firing behaviour of masseter motoneurons may suggest that classical Renshaw cell inhibition is lacking in this motoneuron pool. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Masseter; Recurrent; Single motor units; Synchronization; Trigeminal","acetylcarnitine; sodium chloride; adult; article; controlled study; cortical synchronization; electromyogram; female; human; human experiment; male; masseter muscle; mastication; motor unit potential; muscle isometric contraction; priority journal; recurrent inhibition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34247480386"

We generate, simulate, and refine an object statechart from an initial set of method contracts which in turn help further validating and enhancing these contracts. The impact of this analysis can be multifold: first, it identifies various discrepancies like incomplete and inconsistent class specifications, second, a correct and consistent object statechart model is obtained from which reliable automated code and unit tests can easily be generated, third, facilitate essential and effective verification for software re-use, forth, the resulting statechart and class specifications are in a lock-steps which facilitates effective incremental development and change management and fifth, it allows a modeler to specify object's dynamic requirements declaratively on an abstract level, without the need to use full operational dynamic diagrams.

While the statement of a concurrent protocol is typically small taking only a few pages to complete, the statement implicitly introduces an exponential or possibly infinite space of possible interleavings. The novice is not aware of this, and as a result sometimes does not understand the lecture. To overcome this pitfall, exploration of the protocol interleaving is practiced from day one. A classical example being how many results does 100 threads executing i++ have? Separation of concerns is used to minimize the interleaving space at design time. Specifically, abstract primitives, such as atomic block and a conditional atomic block are introduced as a design tool. They are typically not to be found in practical programming languages. This reduces the space of interleavings to be considered at design time and facilitate verification and review of the protocol. On the other hand, the approach introduces pitfalls encountered in the translation/implementation stage. Once the abstract design is verified and/or tested, it needs to be translated to a commercial language where the synchronization primitives, for performance reasons, are weaker. For example, an atomic block is implemented using a lock unlock pair. But now atomicity needs to be ensured by the protocol implementer - a typical pitfall being the confusion of a lock/unlock code segment with an atomic block. Locations in the code that access the protected shared resources should be identified and access needs to follow the lock/unlock protocol. Exceptions and signals needs to be handled appropriately and adhere to the lock/unlock protocol. To avoid translation pitfalls, bug patterns are taught and precise understanding of the synchronization primitives is emphasized. Testing of the implemented protocol is taught. Testing should be aggressive, at unit test, and attempt to cover the interleaving space instead of common practice of testing concurrency at system test in a round about way through stress. Tools like ConTest or CHESS can be applied to this end.

As an exposure control, in some weeks students were presented target material for additional reading. Quizzing, but not additional reading, improved performance on the criterial tests relative to material not targeted by quizzes. Further, short answer quizzes produced more robust benefits than multiple choice quizzes. This pattern converges with laboratory findings showing that recall tests are more beneficial than recognition tests for subsequent memory performance. We conclude that in the classroom testing can be used to promote learning, not just to evaluate learning. © 2007 Psychology Press.","","article; controlled study; education program; human; laboratory test; learning; mental function; priority journal; reading; recall; research; school","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34347371979"

Recently, D-TDD has gained much attention as an efficient duplex scheme for high-speed data communications, because adaptive switching ability enables a system to obtain statistical multiplexing gain by exploiting dynamic and asymmetric data traffic. However, it has been noted that strong co-channel interference can be present due to adaptive switching in a cellular network that uses frequency reuse. To suppress the effect of strong co-channel interference and obtain the benefit of D-TDD, we employ time slot allocation (TSA) strategy along with sector antenna layouts. In addition to bandwidths adaptation to the dynamic and asymmetric traffic pattern, we also change the transmission mode based on the channel state of each link. For each time slot, the modulation level can be adaptively selected from multilevel transmission modes, satisfying the required packet error rate (PER) performance. Hence, the algorithm not only suppresses co-channel interference by co-operative time slot allocation, but also adopts multi-level transmission modes, with different modulation formats and coding for each time slot, so that maximum spectral efficiency can be achieved. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of these systems. ©2004 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Data communication systems; Modulation; Resource allocation; Signal interference; Statistical methods; Switching; Telecommunication traffic; Time division multiple access; Wireless telecommunication systems; Dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) systems; Packet error rate (PER); Time slot allocation (TSA); Wireless cellular networks; Telecommunication networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-27744583033"

Time division duplex (TDD) is an efficient approach to combat the traffic asymmetry issues via adapting the resource (time slots) for uplink and downlink. However, asymmetric traffic will cause cross-slot co-channel interference, which can seriously degrade the system performance. This paper proposes a novel link-proportional dynamical channel assignment (LP-DCA) scheme with directional antennas to alleviate the impact of cross-slot interference in the code division multiple access (CDMA) system. The proposed scheme partitions the whole users in a sector into several groups according to their received link quality. Basically, the LP-DCA assigns the time slots with higher potential cross-slot interference to the group of users with better link quality, or vice versa. Through the simulation, we demonstrate that the LP-DCA can reduce the cross-slot interference significantly, thereby improving the system capacity.","CDMA; Cross-slot interference; DCA; Directional antennas; TDD; Traffic asymmetry","Computer simulation; Directional patterns (antenna); Directive antennas; Telecommunication links; Telecommunication traffic; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cross-slot interference; DCA; Directional antennas; TDD; Traffic asymmetry; Code division multiple access","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-2942685260"

When agile approaches in your organization don't work as expected or you feel caught in the choice between agility and discipline, it is time to stop and think about software development rhythms! Agile software development is a popular development process that continues to reshape philosophies on the connections between disciplined processes and agile practices. In Software Development Rhythms, authors Lui and Chan explain how adopting one practice and combining it with another builds upon the flexibility of agile practices to create a type of ""synergy"" defined as software development rhythms. The authors demonstrate how these rhythms can be harmonized to achieve synergies, making them stronger together than they would be apart. Software Development Rhythms provides programmers with a powerful metaphor for resolving some classic software management controversies and dealing with some common difficulties in agile software management. Software Development Rhythms is divided into two parts and covers: Essentials - provides an introduction to software development rhythms; explores the programmer's unconscious mind at work on software methodology; discusses the characteristics of the iterative cycle and open source software development; and introduces the topic of agile values and agile practices. Rhythms - compares plagiarism programming with cut-paste programming; provides an in-depth discussion of different ways to approach collaborative programming; demonstrates how to combine and harmonize these practices so they can be applied to common software management problems such as motivating programmers, discovering solution patterns, managing software teams, and rescuing troubled IT projects; and takes a comprehensive look at Scrum, CMMI, Just-In-Time, Lean Software Development, and Test-Driven Development from a software development rhythm perspective. Abundantly illustrated with informative graphics and amusing cartoons, Software Development Rhythms is a comprehensive and thought-provoking introduction to some of the most advanced concepts in current software management. Written in a refreshingly easy-to-read style and filled with interesting anecdotes, simulation exercises, and case studies, Software Development Rhythms is suitable for the practitioner and graduate student alike. It offers readers practical guidance on how to take the themes and concepts presented in this book back to their own projects to harmonize their software practices and release the synergies of their own teams. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","Book","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84889485034"

System tests are effective at exercising complex usage patterns. Differential unit tests (DUT) are a hybrid of unit and system tests that exploits their strengths. They are generated by carving the system components, while executing a system test case, that influence the behavior of the target unit, and then re-assembling those components so that the unit can be exercised as it was by the system test. In this paper we show that DUTs retain some of the advantages of unit tests, can be automatically generated, and have the potential for revealing faults related to intricate system executions. We present a framework for carving and replaying DUTs that accounts for a wide variety of strategies and tradeoffs, we implement an automated instance of the framework with several techniques to mitigate test cost and enhance flexibility and robustness, and we empirically assess the efficacy of carving and replaying DUTs on three software artifacts. © 2009 IEEE.","Automated test generation; Carving and replay; Regression testing","Automation; Software testing; Testing; Automated test generation; Automatically generated; Carving and replay; Differential units; Intricate systems; Re-assembling; Regression testing; Software artifacts; System components; System tests; Test costs; Unit tests; Usage patterns; Automatic test pattern generation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-60449098360"

To avoid cross-slot interference between downlink and uplink, traditional algorithms typically require a global control on the transmission direction in each time slot among all cells. Obviously, this requirement significantly limits one of the key advantages in the TDD system - enabling different rate asymmetry. We observe that the tri-sector cellular architecture possesses additional orthogonality inherently due to the directivity of directional antenna, which can provide an additional degree of freedom in allocating radio resource (i.e., time slots). Thus we propose a new distributed slot allocation algorithm based on the tri-sector cellular architecture. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is to enable a TDD-CDMA system to provide asymmetric services with different rates of asymmetry in all cells, thereby having more flexibility in handling uniform traffic patterns.","Asymmetric services; CDMA system; Channel assignment; Time division duplex (TDD)","Algorithms; Code division multiple access; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Directional patterns (antenna); Signal interference; Telecommunication traffic; Cross slot interference; Slot allocation algorithm; Time division duplex; Tri sector cellular architecture; Time division multiplexing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036058686"

The overall redundancy added to the compressed stream is non-uniformly distributed between the succeeding video frames in order to minimize the mean distortion over the transmitted sequence. The repartition of the redundancy on the video stream is optimized using an analytical approach which aims to alleviate the error propagation along the sequence. Different puncturing patterns of the rate 13 turbo-coder were considered in our simulations. The results obtained here are compared to those with a classical equal error protection scheme.

Dose linearity, beam flatness, and beam energies were studied at low MU settings with various dose rates for different types of linear accelerators. It is observed that for the scattering foil units, the dose/MU is a smooth function of MU for all beam energies. Discrepancies in dose/MU are highest at the lowest MU. Significant variation (5%-245%) in dose linearity is observed among various linear accelerators at low MU settings. Dose rate has no effect on the dose linearity for all energies for the scattering foil units tested. On the contrary, for the scanned beam, there is no predictable pattern as dose/MU is random in nature and varies with time and beam energy. The maximum dosimetric error is observed for the highest energy beam where the beam width is most narrow.

A suitable database, using coded identities, was established from the beginning. Because the sera came from a variety of clinical settings, it was possible to extract information about patterns of requests for tests and about the yield of seropositive cases. The data were able to highlight factors associated with high rates of positive tests that can be lost in amalgamated statewide data. The discovery of HIV-positive females was sporadic and there was a much lower detection rate than from testing males. While males were most commonly diagnosed through specialist venereology services, 61 per cent of diagnoses in females were through nonspecialised practices, often those without previous experience in diagnosis and management of HIV infection. Despite some individual exceptions, the requesting of HIV tests appears generally to have been justifiable (particularly in view of the direction of official preventive campaigns) and not profligate. Overall, where practice was unsatisfactory, this lay less in thoughtless ordering of tests than in failing to include with the specimen the elementary, but vital, epidemiological information requested.","","Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; article; Australia; blood sampling; data base; epidemiological data; female; general practice; health care utilization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; medical information; public health; screening test; venereology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029816687"

Temporary epidural catheter pumps are used to infuse analgesics in patients with chronic intractable pain. Three brands of disposable, non-mechanical pumps adapted for epidural infusion were tested to determine their flow rate efficacy and their cost effectiveness. Methods. Three pump models were tested: the Baxter (2C1075), Homepump (H100020), and SurgiPEACE (SP500-24). Manufacturers of each unit claim to provide a constant 2-mL/h flow rate. A standard setup was used to simulate both the insertion of the catheter into the epidural space and the environmental conditions consistent with patient ambulation. Reservoirs were filled with water and allowed to infuse into a collection receptacle, and flow rates were measured hourly. Four trials were performed with four separate units and flow rate measurements were averaged to determine a flow rate pattern over the entire infusion period. Data were graphed as the percentage of expected flow rate (% of 2 mL/h) versus infusion time (hours), the 90-110% range being defined as acceptable. Results. All pumps initially infused at a rate above 110% for the first 3-6 hours, after which a steady decline in flow rate was observed. The Homepump produced a flow rate in the acceptable range for the greatest part of its infusion period (41%), followed by the SurgiPEACe (34%), and the Baxter unit (10.4%). The Baxter unit was also cumberstone to handle and therefore difficult to fill. The Homepump unit was easily handled but offered considerable resistance to filling, with partial loss of fluid. The SurgiPEACE unit was easy to handle and fill; however, in two of the units tested, an initial blockage was encountered, and manual patency of the connector and/or catheter had to be established. Conclusions. All three units deviated considerably from the claimed flow rate of 2-mL/h, both at the beginning and at the end of the infusion. Presumably, the decreasing flow rates are responsible for the diminishing pain relief often experienced by patients over the course of the infusion. The Homepump unit appeared to be the most cost-effective and the easiest to handle and maintained an acceptable infusion rate for the greatest percentage of the infusion period. The considerable cost benefit of using a nonmechanical disposable pump as opposed to a costly but more reliable computerized pump appears to warrant further product improvement and development.","epidural catheter infusion; flow rate; infusor unit; nonmechanical disposable pumps","article; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; diagnostic accuracy; disposable equipment; epidural anesthesia; flow rate; infusion pump; intractable pain; priority journal; technical aid","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031011608"

Results were recorded by HPF and tumor cellularity, considering both average and standard deviation. Differences were analyzed by Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and considered significant if p<0.05. PR was significantly higher in malignant (23.29±12.49) than in benign tumors (3.86±4.44) and in poromanodular hidradenoma (4.99±3.34) than in spiradenoma-cylindroma-syringoma (1.91±1.67), but not by malignant tumor type.

PR and MFC are useful malignancy criteria in skin TDD and should be evaluated by tumor cellularity to avoid potential misinterpretations related with tumor heterogeneity.

We analyze the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) outage performance of a D-TDD fixed cellular system, and propose a scheme to improve the outage probability performance. First, outage probability is evaluated using an analytical model, when omnidirectional antennas are deployed at a base-station site and a subscriber site. Our model is verified, using Monte Carlo simulations. According to our investigation, the outage performance of the D-TDD system is severely limited by a strong interference from the cochannel cell on the downlink, while the reference cell is in the uplink cycle. To improve the outage performance during uplink receptions, we introduce two time-slot allocation methods, combined with sector antennas: the Max Min{SIR} and Max{SIR}. The Max Min{SIR} is an exhaustive search algorithm for assigning subscribers to a few extra uplink time slots, so as to maximize the minimum SIR expectation value over the extra uplink time-slots region. It is used as a performance benchmark in our analysis. Meanwhile, the Max{SIR} is a simpler and efficient algorithm for improving the outage performance. It is established that the performance difference between the two algorithms is not noticeable. Especially, the difference is negligible, when the dynamic range of the traffic pattern between uplink and downlink is small. Also, the outage performance of a system that employs the Max{SIR} algorithm combined with sectored antennas is compared to that of a system employing adaptive-array antennas. The proposed system shows promise, and offers a compromise between system complexity and network guaranteed availability.","Cochannel interference; Dynamic time-division duplex; Wireless cellular networks","Algorithms; Cochannel interference; Computer simulation; Diversity reception; Frequency allocation; Interference suppression; Mathematical models; Mobile antennas; Monte Carlo methods; Probability; Radio links; Wireless telecommunication systems; Dynamic time division duplex; Exhaustive search algorithm; Frequency division duplex; Signal to interference ratio; Time slot allocation; Wireless cellular network; Cellular radio systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036811322"

Materials and methods: In anesthetised cats recordings were made from 15 group III (conduction velocity 2.5-20 m/s) and 25 group IV afferent units (conduction velocity < 2.5 m/s) of the medial articular nerve of normal and acutely inflamed knee joints. SP (10 and 100 μg) was administered close-arterially. Results: SP at doses of 10 μg and 100 μg activated less than 50% of both group III and group IV units. The proportion of SP-positive units was significantly higher in inflamed (10 of 21) than in normal joints (2 of 18). SP induced activity in initially silent units or increased ongoing activity after latencies varying from 2 s to 5 min. The SP-evoked activity had an irregular pattern, a variable duration, and was not related to the dose injected. Bolus injections of SP (100 μg) sensitised group III articular afferents but not group IV units to noxious movements of the joint, regardless whether the units were from normal or acutely inflamed joints. The responses to innocuous movements were not influenced by SP. Group III units, initially not activated by any movement, displayed vigorous discharges to noxious movements after close-arterial SP. In 3 group III units tested, the SP-induced augmentation of responses to noxious movements was not mimicked by close-arterial injection of histamine (3.3 μg). Conclusions: It is concluded that SP contributes to the sensitisation of a subpopulation of high-threshold articular afferents. Thus this neuronal mediator released peripherally in response to an injury or acute inflammation causes considerable changes in the mechanosensitivity of this subpopulation of nociceptive joint afferents.","Articular afferent; Knee joint; Nociceptor; Substance P","Animals; Arthritis, Experimental; Cartilage, Articular; Cats; Evoked Potentials; Female; Hindlimb; Histamine; Male; Movement; Neurons, Afferent; Physical Stimulation; Stimulation, Chemical; Substance P; substance P; animal model; article; cat; controlled study; female; inflammation; knee disease; male; mechanical stimulation; nociceptive receptor; nonhuman; sensory nerve","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034996583"

The adaptive array controls the directivity pattern of the base station to reduce co-channel interference during reception; the same array pattern is applied during transmission to prevent unnecessary illumination. Computer simulation results show that the cluster size can be reduced to one with time division duplexing (TDD), indicating that we can reuse the same frequency group at all cells. Thus, the improvement in spectral efficiency is as much as 16 fold that of an omni-antenna. Moreover, load sharing, which is expected to improve the channel utilization for unbalanced load situations, is available by cell overlapping. Frequency division duplexing (FDD) requires a weight adjust function to be applied for transmission since the difference in frequency between signal reception and transmission causes null positioning error. However, simple LMS-adjusting can provide a cluster size of one as well as cell overlapping when the frequency deference is 5%.","","Antenna arrays; Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Errors; Frequency division multiplexing; Performance; Radio interference; Radio receivers; Radio transmission; Reception quality; Signal to noise ratio; Time division multiplexing; Adaptive array; Base station antenna pattern; Cluster size; Cochannel interference; Down link; Land mobile cellular systems; Signal to interference ratio; Spectral efficiency improvement; Up link; Cellular radio systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028425188"

Method: A descriptive, epidemiological study of alcohol use based on data gathered biannually from multiple sources over 4 years, including specialist treatment centers, trauma units, mortuaries, psychiatric facilities, and surveys of school students and arrestees. Networks were set up in five sentinel sites to facilitate the collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results: Indicators point to the widespread misuse of alcohol. Alcohol consistently dominates the demand for substance use disorders treatment services. In the second half of 2000, 51.1% (Cape Town) to 77.0% (Mpumalanga) of patients reported alcohol as their primary substance of abuse. A high proportion of patients in trauma units tested positive for alcohol in 2000, ranging from 40.3% (Durban) to 91.8% (Port Elizabeth). Similarly, a high proportion of mortality cases tested positive for alcohol, ranging from 40.3% (Durban) to 67.2% (Port Elizabeth). Although treatment demand is dominated by men and older persons, alcohol misuse occurs among all sectors. School surveys reflect harmful drinking patterns among students, with 53.3% and 36.5% of male students in Durban and Cape Town, respectively, reporting heavy-drinking episodes by Grade 11. Discussion: Alcohol misuse has a number of implications for public health policy, such as the need to develop protocols for the management of alcohol-positive patients in trauma units and to target prevention programs at heavy drinking by young people. Further monitoring of alcohol misuse and its associated negative consequences is required.","","Adult; Alcoholism; Breath Tests; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Humans; Male; Population Surveillance; South Africa; Substance-Related Disorders; alcohol; adult; alcohol abuse; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; article; drinking behavior; emergency health service; health care facility; health care policy; health program; health survey; human; mortality; offender; preventive medicine; public health service; South Africa; student; substance abuse; addiction; breath analysis; chi square distribution; female; health survey; male; methodology; South Africa","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035988555"

The ability to discriminate between these two kinds of retinal image slip is necessary for the perception of a stable visual world. In order to determine if this ability is already present in monkey visual area V1, we asked if single V1 units are able to differentiate between externally and self-induced retinal image slip. Externally induced retinal image slip was realized in the 'object motion' condition (OMC) by moving a behaviourally irrelevant visual stimulus ('object': a bar or a large random dot pattern) across the receptive field while the monkey fixated a small, stationary target. Conversely, self-induced retinal image slip of comparable size was evoked in the 'ego motion' condition (EMC) by asking the monkey to pursue the target, moving at the speed of the object in the OMC, while the object was kept stationary, We recorded 221 units from visual area V1, 51 (23%) of them directionally selective, and compared their responses to self-induced and externally induced retinal image slip. Many of them seemed to give some preference to externally induced retinal image slip. However, on closer examination it became clear that this seeming preference could be attributed to the fact that oculomotor performance was less precise in the EMC than in the OMC, causing a larger deviation from the optimal retinal image trajectory in the EMC. We show that the impact of eye position errors can be eliminated by the use of a position-invariant stimulus, such as large-field random dot patterns. We then show that the impact of both eye position errors and deviation of eye velocity from target velocity in the EMC can be eliminated by moving the stimulus in a given OMC trial according to an inverted replica of the eye movement trajectory in the preceding EMC trial, guaranteeing identical retinal stimulation in the OMC and the EMC. If identical retinal stimulation was ensured, none of the V1 units tested was able to differentiate between externally and self-induced retinal image slip. We conclude that V1 does not contribute to the perception of a world which is stable despite eye movements.","Motion processing; Object motion; Rhesus monkey; Smooth pursuit eye movements; Striate cortex; Visual stability","Animals; Discrimination (Psychology); Eye Movements; Female; Macaca mulatta; Motion Perception; Neurons; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Retina; Visual Pathways; animal experiment; article; controlled study; eye movement; eye movement control; eye position; female; motion; nonhuman; perception; priority journal; retina image; rhesus monkey; smooth pursuit eye movement; vision; visual stimulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029974725"

Recordings of extracellular spike activity were made from 80 single units in the left olfactory bulb of 11 anaesthetised, freely breathing adult hens (Gallus domesticus). The units were spontaneously active, exhibiting widely variable firing rates (0.07-47.28 spikes/s) and variable temporal firing patterns. Single units were tested for their response to an ascending concentration series of either ammonia (2.5-100 ppm) or hydrogen sulphide (1-50 ppm), delivered directly to the olfactory epithelium. Stimulation with a calibrated gas delivery system resulted in modification of spontaneous activity causing either inhibition (47% of units) or excitation (53%) of firing. For ammonia, 20 of the 35 units tested exhibited a response, while for hydrogen sulphide, 25 of the 45 units tested were responsive. Approximate response thresholds for ammonia (median threshold 3.75 ppm (range 2.5-60 ppm, n=20)) and hydrogen sulphide (median threshold 1 ppm (range 1-10 ppm, n=25)) were determined with most units exhibiting thresholds near the lower end of these ranges. Stimulus response curves were constructed for 23 units; 16 (the most complete) were subjected to a linear regression analysis to determine whether they were best fitted by a linear, log or power function. No single function provided the best fit for all the curves (seven were linear, eight were log, one was power). These findings show that avian units respond to changes in stimulus concentration in a manner generally consistent with reported responses in mammalian olfactory bulb neurones. However, this study illustrates a level of fine-tuning to small step changes in concentration (<5 ppm) not previously demonstrated in vertebrate single olfactory bulb neurones. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

All units (n = 59) increased their discharge rate when an object passed the fish laterally either from anterior to posterior or in the opposite direction. Different units could show different temporal response patterns. In 29 out of 49 units tested (59%) the number of spikes caused by an object moving from anterior to posterior along the side of the fish was significantly different from those caused by an object moving from posterior to anterior. Two units encoded motion direction by different temporal patterns of discharge. In general, discharge rates decreased when object distance was increased or when object speed was decreased. Changes in object size and shape did not affect the strength of unit responses as much as changes in object speed and distance. The data indicate that some midbrain lateral line units in the goldfish encode motion direction but are not tuned to other aspects of an object moving in the water. In this respect, the responses of units in the midbrain are similar to those reported for medullary units of goldfish.

Thirty-nine Vi/Vc and 26 Vc/C1 neurons that responded to mechanical and electrical stimulation of the cornea were examined for convergent cutaneous receptive fields, responses to natural stimulation of the corneal surface by CO2 pulses (0, 30, 60, 80, and 95%), effects of morphine, and projections to the contralateral thalamus. Forty-six percent of mechanically sensitive Vi/Vc neurons and 58% of Vc/Cl neurons were excited by CO2 stimulation. The evoked activity of most cells occurred at 60% CO2 after a delay of 7-22 s. At the Vi/Vc transition three response patterns were seen. Type I cells (n = 11) displayed an increase in activity with increasing CO2 concentration. Type II cells (n = 7) displayed a biphasic response, an initial inhibition followed by excitation in which the magnitude of the excitatory phase was dependent on CO2 concentration. A third category of Vi/Vc cells (type III, n = 3) responded to CO2 pulses only after morphine administration (> 1.0 mg/kg). At the Vc/C1 transition, all CO2-responsive cells (n = 15) displayed an increase in firing rates with greater CO2 concentration, similar to the pattern of type I Vi/Vc cells. Comparisons of the effects of CO2 pulses on Vi/Vc type I units, Vi/Vc type II units, and Vc/C1 corneal units revealed no significant differences in threshold intensity, stimulus encoding, or latency to sustained firing. Morphine (0.5-3.5 mg/kg iv) enhanced the CO2-evoked activity of 50% of Vi/Vc neurons tested, whereas all Vc/C1 cells were inhibited in a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible manner. Stimulation of the contralateral posterior thalamic nucleus antidromically activated 37% of Vc/C1 corneal units; however, no effective sites were found within the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus or nucleus submedius. None of the Vi/Vc corneal units tested were antidromically activated from sites within these thalamic regions. Corneal-responsive neurons in the Vi/Vc and Vc/C1 regions likely serve different functions in ocular nociception, a conclusion reflected more by the difference in sensitivity to analgesic drugs and efferent projection targets than by the CO2 stimulus intensity encoding functions. Collectively, the properties of Vc/C1 corneal neurons were consistent with a role in the sensory-discriminative aspects of ocular pain due to chemical irritation. The unique and heterogeneous properties of Vi/Vc corneal neurons suggested involvement in more specialized ocular functions such as reflex control of tear formation or eye blinks or recruitment of antinociceptive control pathways.","","carbon dioxide; morphine sulfate; naloxone; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; cornea; dose response; electrostimulation; intravenous drug administration; male; mechanical stimulation; nociception; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; receptive field; spinal cord dorsal horn; thalamus; trigeminal nucleus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032693864"

A Wideband Directional Channel Model is used, characterising specific micro-cell, street-type scenarios. These differ in the number of mobile terminals, grouped and placed along the street axis, and on their distances to the base station. Time- and angle-of-arrival spreads, and on-the-air interference content are the main parameters inherently varied and analysed. The average beamforming gain and signal-to-noise ratio are evaluated, also varying the number of array elements. The high number of arriving correlated and closely correlated signals, together with the composed nature of the correlation matrix in the algorithm's cost function, result in that other than the MMSE solutions may lead to the best interference suppression, for the tested scenarios. Among the several weighted interfering power components, the most relevant is due to the delayed signals from all the other links. The combination of the number of arriving orthogonal codes, time-of-arrival and angle-of-arrival spreads condition beamforming performance: the number of array elements affect performance, depending on the mobile terminal distance to the base station, and on the number of active links: for short distances and large number of users, larger time-of-arrival spread degrades beamformer performance, over the opposing effect of angle-of-arrival spread; the number of active users affects beamforming gain especially in the case that delay spreads are larger, i.e., for shorter mobile terminal distances to the base station.","Adaptive beamforming; UMTS; Wideband directional propagation channel","Communication channels (information theory); Correlation methods; Evaluation; Interference suppression; Matrix algebra; Mobile telecommunication systems; Signal to noise ratio; Telecommunication links; Adaptive beamforming; Conjugate gradient normal equation residual problem; Correlation matrix; Wideband directional channel model; Directional patterns (antenna)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037287176"

The synchronization scheme, both acquisition and tracking, is based on a simple time division duplexing (TDD) frame structure, which consists of a pilot tone, a frame ID (Word Sync), and actual data. The acquisition process is accomplished by means of frame synchronization, based on coarse energy detection of the received signal and the pattern matching of a 21-digit Barker code. The proposed scheme for synchronous-access frequency-hopped transceivers is much simpler than a parallel search method based on parallel matched filters, and relatively faster compared to a PN acquisition scheme based on serial search. Although FSK signals are detected noncoherently, a frequency tracking loop is required to compensate for the carrier frequency offset between the transmitter and receiver. The receiver also needs a time tracking loop to recover the clock from the received data. Both loops use a digital phase-locked loop architecture with programmable loop bandwidths.","","Algorithms; Bandwidth; Codes (symbols); Data acquisition; Frequency hopping; Frequency shift keying; Modulation; Phase locked loops; Radio communication; Signal detection; Transceivers; Barker code; Frame synchronization; Frequency tracking loop; Pattern matching; Time division diplexing; Synchronization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029707990"

Although manually created unit tests are valuable, they are often insufficient; therefore, programmers can use an automatic unit-test-generation tool to produce a large number of additional tests for a class. However, without a priori specifications, programmers cannot practically inspect the execution of each automatically generated test. In this paper, we develop the observer abstraction approach for automatically extracting object-state-transition information of a class from unit-test executions, without requiring a priori specifications. Given a class and a set of its initial tests generated by a third-party tool, we generate new tests to augment the initial tests and produce the abstract state of an object based on the return values of a set of observers (public methods with non-void returns) invoked on the object. From the executions of both the new and initial tests, we automatically extract observer abstractions, each of which is an object state machine (OSM): a state in the OSM represents an abstract state and a transition in the OSM represents method calls. We have implemented the Obstra tool for the approach and have applied the approach on complex data structures; our experiences suggest that this approach provides useful object-state-transition information for programmers to inspect unit-test executions effectively. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.","","Abstracting; Automatic test pattern generation; Computer software maintenance; Object oriented programming; Software design; Specifications; Automatic extraction; Automatically generated; Complex data structures; Object oriented; State machine; State transitions; Third-party tools; Unit test generations; Software testing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-35048891581"

The recordings were performed both at rest and on application of cutaneous stimuli of various intensities before and after exposure of the corresponding receptive fields to vibration (0.5 mm peak to peak, 100 pulses/s, 10 min). The results show that 11% of the units tested, which were previously silent, developed a bursting pattern of postvibratory activity, which lasted 12 min on average. This induced resting activity may account for the tingling sensations usually perceived after exposure to vibration. Furthermore, application of vibration to the cutaneous receptive fields impaired the response properties of the corresponding cutaneous fibers much more markedly in the case of the SAI than in the FAI units. More specifically, less than one-half of the FAI fibers tested showed a postvibratory depressed sensitivity to skin stroking applied at various velocities that persisted for only a few minutes, whereas the responses of all the SAI units to suprathreshold maintained skin indentations applied with increasing amplitudes decreased significantly for 20 min. These fairly durable changes in the transductive properties of the mechanoreceptive afferent units probably lead to an impairment of perceptual and sensorimotor processes and consequently may at least partly account for the alterations in sensorimotor performance that have been reported to occur in humans after exposure to vibration.","Cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferent units; Postvibratory effects; Unitary activities","Adult; Afferent Pathways; Female; Humans; Male; Neurons, Afferent; Perception; Skin Physiology; Vibration; adult; article; foot; human; human experiment; leg; mechanoreceptor; neurography; normal human; priority journal; sensory nerve; skin receptor; skin stimulation; vibration sense","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029862888"

We developed a new method which might objectively measure random-dot stereopsis in preverbal children. Patients and methods: We project two separate random-dot images into the left and right eye using a 3D-monitor. If both eyes are perfectly aligned and random stereopsis is present, the child perceives a stimulus. Four different stimulus positions are shown at random. An infrared oculography system objectively detects whether the stimuli are seen. By using a specific baby examination unit, testing is already feasible in infants. Results: We present the plots of two children with a positive (normal) and two with a negative (pathologic) response to random-dot stimuli. Conclusions: This new examination technique allows an objective assessment of random-dot stereopsis in non-verbal children. It permits us for the first time to study the development of stereovision under natural conditions. In future, the method may also be used to screen preverbal children for visual abnormalities.

Units showed phase‐locked responses to SAM stimulation (55%) and SFM stimulation (80%), with modulation frequencies up to 18 Hz. Tuning characteristics to the modulation frequency were mainly band‐pass with best modulation frequencies (BMFs) between 4 and 15 Hz. Units with synchronized activity to SFM stimulation showed three response types with respect to the direction of the frequency modulation: 52% were selective to the upward direction, 30% to the downward direction, and 18% had no preference. Triangular frequency modulations were used to test if units were tuned to specific modulation frequencies or to specific rates of frequency change. In the vast majority of units tested the response characteristics were strongly influenced by varying the modulation frequency, whereas varying the rate of frequency change had little effect in the stimulus range used. Units that showed phase‐locked responses to SAM and SFM stimulation had similar activity patterns in response to both types of stimuli. BMFs for SAM and SFM stimulation were significantly correlated. Intrinsic oscillations of up to 20 Hz could be seen in the spontaneous activity and after the stimuli independent of the stimulus type. Oscillation frequencies were significantly correlated with the BMFs of the respective units. The results are discussed in terms of a mechanism for periodicity detection based on a temporal code. This could be important for the recognition of complex acoustic signals. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

However, in the TDD/CDMA cellular system, uplink signals may suffer strong interference from the downlink transmission of neighboring base stations. This kind of opposite direction interference has adverse impact on the TDD/CDMA system performance. In this paper, we propose to apply the MVDR beamforming technique to suppress the opposite direction interference. We evaluate the uplink performance of the proposed technique by simulation. Moreover, by jointly employing transmit beamforming in all asynchronous cells, the TDD/CDMA cellular system can allow different rates of asymmetry in different cells. Thus, each cell can design its own pattern of slot allocation.","Antenna arrays; MVDR beamforming; TDD/CDMA system; Transmit beamforming","Antenna arrays; Cellular radio systems; Cochannel interference; Code division multiple access; Computer simulation; Diversity reception; Radio interference; Radio links; Telecommunication traffic; Time division multiplexing; Asymmetric traffic; Minimum variance distortionless response; Time division duplex; Interference suppression","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036445643"

Mechanisms of neural coding of gustatory stimuli were studied in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the first relay in the neural pathway for gustation, in anesthetized rats. Taste-responsive NTS units were identified as 'relay' or 'nonrelay' based on the electrophysiological response to electrical pulses delivered to the parabrachial nucleus of the pons (PbN), the second relay in the neural pathway for gustation. Coding mechanisms in each group were analyzed separately. 2.Taste responses to sapid solutions of NaCl (0.1 M), HCl (0.01 M), quinine HCl (0.01 M), sucrose (0.5 M) and Na-saccharin (0.004 M) were recorded in single units in the NTS. After gustatory stimulation, electrophysiological responses to electrical stimulation of the taste-responsive part of the ipsilateral PbN were recorded. A 0.2-ms pulse was delivered at 75-250 μA at a rates of 1, 25, 50 and 100 pps through a bipolar stainless steel electrode. An antidromic response was defined as a time-locked spike that occurred at a fixed latency after PbN stimulation that followed high stimulation frequencies. A collision test also was performed. 3. Of 42 taste-responsive NTS units, 19 (45%) were relay units, 22 (52%) were nonrelay and 1 unit was activated orthodromically by PbN stimulation. Latencies of evoked spikes ranged from 1.75 to 4.0 ms 2.1 ± 0.2 ms (mean ± SE, median, 1.75 ms). 4. Examination of general response characteristics revealed few differences among relay and nonrelay units. The mean response rates produced by taste stimuli were similar in relay and nonrelay units, with the exception of saccharin, which evoked a significantly larger response in relay units compared with nonrelay units. Classification of units based on their best, i.e., most effective, stimulus showed that most units in both groups were either NaCl- or HCl-best. Relay units were most frequently HCl-best; non relay units were most frequently NaCl-best. 5. Both relay and nonrelay units were broadly responsive across the taste stimuli that were tested. Almost all units in both groups responded to more than one taste stimulus; however, significantly more relay units responded to three or more of the representatives of the four basic taste qualities (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter). The uncertainty measure, an index of the breadth of tuning, was not different in relay and nonrelay units. 6. The labeled line index also was calculated to assess the extent to which pairwise comparisons of taste stimuli by the associated across unit patterns of response were accomplished by a labeled line code, where separate subsets of units respond to each stimulus of a pair, or by a frequency code, where both stimuli evoke responses in the same subset of units, albeit with different magnitudes. Results suggested that pairwise comparisons of taste stimuli among relay units were characterized predominatly by labeled line types of codes but showed more evidence of frequency codes among nonrelay units. 7. Across unit patterns of response were analyzed using a vector space analysis. In this approach, the response of each unit to a given stimulus is treated as a coordinate in n-dimensional space, where n is the number of units tested. The vector defined by the responses of the sample of units literally represents the across unit pattern evoked by a taste stimulus. When the relationships among these vectors were analyzed for NTS units, results suggested that, for relay units, the across unit patterns associated with palatable stimuli, i.e., NaCl and sucrose, were more similar to each other than they were to the across unit patterns produced by unpalatable stimuli, i.e., HCl and quinine. The converse was also true. In contrast to previous reports that proposed that the NTS preferentially conveys information about hedonically positive stimuli to the PbN from the NTS may enhance the differences between palatable and unpalatable stimuli to more rostral structures.","","hydrochloric acid; quinine; saccharin sodium; sodium chloride; sucrose; animal experiment; animal tissue; antidromic stimulation; article; electrostimulation; nonhuman; parabrachial nucleus; priority journal; rat; solitary tract nucleus; taste discrimination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029080255"

A mismatch between the BLER and the target SIR usually results since the actual and assumed channel conditions are rarely the same. This mismatch tends to be especially large at very low BLERs. The OLPC depends on cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) and often takes a long time to converge to the required target SIR for low target BLERs. In this paper a channel-adaptive algorithm is presented that controls the target SIR for downlink transmission in WCDMA TDD. The proposed algorithm characterizes the multipath channel profile using predefined multipath channel patterns and compensates for the channel/mapping errors. Link level simulations are conducted in various channel conditions defined by 3GPP and the ITU. The comparison in performance between the channel-adaptive algorithm and the generic ""jump algorithm"" is illustrated and conclusions are drawn.","","Algorithms; Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Power control; Radio interference; Telecommunication links; Wireless telecommunication systems; Downlink; Code division multiple access","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0041470255"

One straightforward way is to use open-loop and closed-loop uplink synchronization (ULS) control techniques to turn asynchronous uplink back to synchronous operation mode. The use of ULS control can greatly enhance bilateral data transmission throughput in both uplink and downlink channels of a mobile cellular as a direct result from improved transmission imparity between them. This is especially important for some applications where the traffic in the both links should be made equally high, such as video conferencing. This paper will also introduce a modeling method to analyze performance of ULS control in a mobile cellular system. It should be noted that, although this paper's study is carried out under the TD-SCDMA framework, the method can be equally applicable to any TDD-based 3G and 4G wireless systems that choose ULS control as the means to achieve isotropic air-link transmission. A numerical analysis based on propagation delay estimation will be used to derive probability of successful ULS control under consideration of the impact of different channel environments, such as reflection coefficients, propagation patterns, attenuation gradient and cell size, etc.","","Attenuation; Cellular radio systems; Data communication systems; Interfaces (computer); Performance; Probability; Synchronization; 4G mobile communication systems; Synchronization; Video conferencing; 3G and 4G wireless systems; Isotropic air-interface; Mobile cellular systems; Performance analysis; Propagation delays; Propagation pattern; Synchronous operations; Uplink synchronization; Base stations; Propagation patterns; Random scattering; Uplink channels; Code division multiple access; Code division multiple access","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-4143099104"

For this purpose, noncontact and, particularly, optical techniques to obtain experimental data may be attractive. This article discusses the possibility of using pulsed laser interferometry in this application. Based on this technique, the experiment should result in the mixture density distribution integrated along the light path. Requirements for high-quality interference patterns have been analyzed in application to typical experimental conditions, to show that they may be produced with specific restrictions set on the mixture constitution. Generally, the TM zone has no symmetry. Therefore, the problem of reconstructing 3D density distributions (TDD) of gases can be solved by sufficiently providing many TM zone integral projections (or aspects). It is technically difficult and expensive to achieve this large number of aspects (N> 10). Therefore, it is essential that a reconstruction method be selected to allow the solution of the problem with the least possible number of aspects. Given that the experiment data are incomplete, the reconstruction methods that are based on the concept of maximum data entropy did well. Information a priori about the solution to be sought for an isobaric gas mixture is that its each constituent has invariable density. Thus, a functional data entropy can be defined that is similar to Fermi gas in statistical physics. An algorithm has been suggested for reconstruction as a modified maximum-bounded entropy procedure (Bashurin et al. 1995). This makes reasonable good reconstruction achievable even with as few aspects as N = 4. Experiments on the study of TM of a propane jet in air using a four-aspects laser interferometer were provided and reconstruction of propane concentration distribution was conducted. The results allow determination of the TM zone spectral characteristics.","","Algorithms; Density of gases; Interferometry; Mixing; Mixtures; Three dimensional; Data entropy; Hydrodynamic quantities; Quantitative measurement feasibility; Turbulent mixing zone; Turbulence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030719099"

The results revealed the following. (1) Three different PF neuronal populations were observed according to their response pattern following noxious stimulation: nociceptive-on, nociceptive-off, and nonresponsive units. Only the nociceptive-on units were studied further. (2) The nociceptive discharges in majority of PF neurons (66/87) were inhibited by electrical stimulation of the LC. (3) The inhibitory effect of LC stimulation was prevented and even reversed by pretreatment of IT Ph (40 nmol) in 22 units, or by dorsolateral funiculi transection in 24 units tested. (4) The inhibitory effect of LC stimulation was strengthened by preadministration of ICV Ph (40 nmol) in 17 units tested. (5) ICV administration of norepinephrine (NE 30 nmol) resulted in PF neurons a biphasic response to nociceptive stimulation: an early brief inhibition and a late long-lasting facilitation. (6) Pretreatment of ICV Ph (40 nmol) prior to NE injection prevented the NE-induced biphasic response. The results suggest that stimulation of LC modulates the nociceptive response of PF neurons through both ascending and descending routes. These two diverse routes exert two different effects: a predominantly inhibitory role on the nociceptive transmission at the spinal cord level by descending NE-ergic fibers, and a facilitatory role on the responsiveness of PF to noxious inputs by ascending fibers.","Descending and ascending pathways; Locus coeruleus; Pain modulation; Parafascicular neurons","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Animals; Denervation; Evoked Potentials; Female; Injections, Intraventricular; Injections, Spinal; Locus Coeruleus; Male; Neurons, Afferent; Neurons, Efferent; Nociceptors; Norepinephrine; Pain; Phentolamine; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Spinal Cord; noradrenalin; phentolamine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; electrostimulation; female; locus ceruleus; male; nerve projection; nerve transection; nociception; nonhuman; noradrenergic nerve; priority journal; rat; thalamus parafascicular nucleus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031024566"

It is characterized by a discontinuous line of ophiolitic bodies in southern Tibet and beyond. Terranes of different tectonic affinity are scattered along this line and represent remnants of the Tethys, a wide oceanic expanse existed throughout the Mesozoic and eventually closed along the suture in the Eocene. These terranes are targets of an extensive study by the Tibet Research Group, HKU aimed at more comprehensive understanding of the Tethys closure and tectonic evolution of the suture. Here results of structural and biostratigraphic investigation of the Bainang terrane are presented. The Bainang terrane, distinguished in the central part of the suture, comprises rock units previously referred to as infra-ophiolitic thrust sheets of radiolarites or Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous red radiolarites. It is situated between the ophiolitic suite of the Dazhuqu terrane to the north and Indian passive margin series to the south. The terrane is characterized by a pile containing numerous north-facing and chiefly south-verging imbricated slices. These tectonic slices incorporate various lithologies: chert, siliceous and tuffaceous mudstones, limestone, siliceous and calcareous shales. The most complete and well-exposed piece of the terrane near Bainang has been mapped and sampled for radiolarian biostratigraphic study. Five litho-tectonic units are discriminated on the basis of characteristic lithologies and structural styles. From north to south they are: Bangga, Zongxia, Maniga, Yalongmai and Renchingang units. The Bangga unit is mostly composed of red ribbon chert with minor siliceous mudstone and is characterized by scattered shear zones bounding tectonic slices and lenses several tens of meters thick. The Zongxia unit comprises predominant siliceous mudstone with numerous tectonic lenses of red ribbon chert. Conjugate tectonic lenses bounded by shear zones is a dominant structure. In both units obtained radiolarians indicate that chert is Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous and siliceous mudstone accumulated in a short interval from middle to upper Aptian. Random distribution of radiolarian ages along several profiles across the Bangga unit testifies for a rather complex internal structure. The Maniga unit is made up of more diverse lithologies which include: (1) Upper Triassic-Middle Jurassic micritic limestone, calciturbidites, siliceous-calcareous rocks, and varicolored calcareous mudstone; (2) Aalenian-Bajocian ferruginous chert; (3) Bajocian-Oxfordian tuffaceous chert and mudstone, basic tuff and silicified tuff; and (4) Kimmerigian-Tithonian red ribbon chert. Rocks of the unit are intensely sheared with typical phacoidal and S-C fabrics. Intensity of shearing progressively increases southwards (across strike) and eastwards (along strike). To the south, this part of the terrane merges to the Yalongmai unit that includes the same lithologies but with a greater proportion of calcareous mudstone. Rocks are more intensely sheared and structural style is characterized by penetrative foliation with stretching lineation deformed by later sporadically developed crenulation and abundant kink bands. In the southernmost Renchingang unit the predominant lithology is gray calcareous shale with protoliths of meter-thick calciturbidites. Subordinate red radiolarian chert and varicolored calcareous shale compose thin and disrupted but traceable tectonic slices. Structural style is the same as for the previous unit. In general, structure of the Bainang terrane is characterized by slice imbrication with elements of large-scale ramp folds comparable to that of other accretionary wedges. A vertical rather than lateral growth of the wedge is most likely mirrored in the structural patterns of the studied fragment. A long history of sedimentation supposedly in different and separate parts of the Tethys is recorded in the reconstructed stratigraphic columns for different units. The youngest rocks incorporated into the Bainang accretionary wedge are mid-upper Aptian siliceous mudstones, hemipelagic deposits similar to lithologies known from many accretionary wedges on-land. The earliest stage of subduction-accretion is thus inferred to have begun by the end of the Aptian as recorded in the studied fragment of the terrane. Although the Aptian siliceous mudstones of two northerly units possess abundant and sometimes thick tuff layers, the lack of any other clastic rocks shed off a volcanic arc is characteristic for this piece of the accretionary wedge. We suggest this may indicate an intra-oceanic setting for this remnant of the accretionary system. Another feature of the terrane is numerous basic sills that intruded rocks of the three southernmost units prior to shearing. The sills probably originated from pre-Kimmeridgian oceanic intra-plate alkaline basic magmatism on the Tethys floor close to the Indian subcontinent.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035041797"

The role of the adaptive array in the canceller is to reduce co-channel interference (CCI) and long-delayed inter-symbol interference (ISI). Thus, the cascaded equalizer needs less complexity. In this paper, we propose to apply the canceller to the base station (BS) of a TDMA/TDD system and to reuse the receiving beam pattern in transmission. Then, in the down-link, the BS emits only the desired signal and short-delayed ISI for a desired mobile station (MS). As a result, with a simple equalizer in the MS, we can get a sufficient path diversity gain also in the down-link. The average bit error rate (BER) performance of the system in a Rayleigh fading channel is calculated by computer simulation. The results show that a sufficient path diversity gain is obtained in the down-link as well as in the up-link.","","Bit error rate; Cochannel interference; Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Directional patterns (antenna); Equalizers; Interference suppression; Intersymbol interference; Radio stations; Rayleigh fading; Time division multiple access; Path pre-selecting adaptive arrays; Mobile radio systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032321290"

However, the outage performance of D-TDD system is severely limited by the strong interference from co-channel cells in a downlink cycle, while the reference cell is in its uplink duty cycle. To suppress the co-channel interference during uplink reception, we consider two kinds of time slot allocation strategies, combined with sector antennas: MaxMin {SIR} and Max {SIR}. MaxMin {SIR} is an optimum time slot allocation strategy, in the sense that it maximizes the minimum signal to interference ratio expectation value over extra uplink time slot region. It is used as a performance benchmark in our analysis. Meanwhile, Max {SIR} is a simple and efficient algorithm to improve outage performance. It is established that the performance difference between the two algorithms is not noticeable, especially when the dynamic range of traffic pattern between the uplink and downlink is small. Also, outage performance comparison between Max {SIR} algorithm and adaptive array antennas is provided. The proposed system shows promise and offers a compromise between system complexity and the desired availability.","","Algorithms; Cochannel interference; Frequency allocation; Network protocols; Reception quality; Slot antennas; Telecommunication links; Telecommunication traffic; Signal to interference ratio; Slot allocation; Time division duplex; Time slot allocation strategies; Uplink reception; Cellular radio systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0035183636"

This region was subjected to Late Cretaceous tectonic activity with the development of regional NW-SE and E-W trending folds. The succession that infills the ""Puriac Basin"" begins with a base-of-slope chaotic unit (0-70 m thick), of middle- late p.p. Turonian age. It overlaps an early-middle Turonian erosional unconformity and is followed upsection by a 430-530 m thick redeposited, calcareous unit (""Calcari del Puriac"", upper Turonian- Campanian p.p.). A truncation surface cuts the Cretaceous formations which were unconformably covered by Paleocene continental-shallow marine units, after regional folding and uplift. The Calcari del Puriac Fm is formed by three calcareous ""turbiditic"" units, respectively late Turonian - earliest Coniacian, Coniacian-Santonian p.p. and Santonian p.p.-Campanian p.p. in age. These units consist of a repetitive stack of (1) lenticular calcirudite - calcarenite lithosomes, which represent channel-fill bodies, followed by (2) sheet-shaped, mainly calcarenitic units, which are interpreted as depositional lobes, and (3) fine-grained redeposited calcarenites and pelagic calcilutites of basin-plain environment. Palaeocurrent indications, facies variations and compositional trends indicate that a carbonate shelf and slope system was located southwards of the Puriac Basin, supplying carbonate detritus to the redeposition processes. Moreover, the compositional trends indicate that rudist reefs supplied abundant detritus to the turbidite units dated as late Turonian and Coniacian - Santonian. From the Santonian onwards, terrigenous clasts were mixed with the limestone particles. This coincided with a severe decrease of platform shedding, which is suggested by the prevalence of limestone lithoclasts, mixed with pelagic biota and calcareous intraclasts, over the platform-derived granules. The evolution of the infill of the Puriac Basin points to synsedimentary tectonic activity, which caused the development of the Turonian and latest Cretaceous - Pateogene unconformities and contributed to the instability of the slope to the south of the basin. The stacking patterns of the turbidite units testifies to cycles of progradation and retrogradation of the platform during the late Turonian -Santonian span of time. A regressive trend towards exposure of the platform is suggested for the Santonian - Campanian, during which the basin history came to an end before Eoalpine uplift and erosion.","Argentera Massif; Cretaceous; Helvetic zone; Redeposited limestones; Stratigraphy; Western Alps","France; Italy; cellular organisms; basin evolution; biostratigraphy; Cretaceous; limestone; redeposition; stratigraphy; tectonic setting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0036340065"

The tonic discharge activity of motor unit pairs was recorded in the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles during voluntary isometric contraction. While undergoing continuous intravenous saline (NaCl 0.9 %) perfusion, the subjects were given a short lasting injection of L-acetylcarnitine (L-Ac), which has been found to potentiate recurrent inhibition in humans. The variability, synchronization and coherence of the motor unit discharges were analysed during four successive test periods (lasting 2-3 min each). A significant decrease in the inter-spike interval (ISI) coefficient of variation was observed in the discharge patterns of the motor units tested in the ECR and not in the ADM, which were not accompanied by any consistent changes in the mean ISIs of the motor unit activity in either muscle. The L-Ac injection also led to a significant increase in the synchronization in half of the motor unit pairs tested in the ECR muscle (n = 29), whereas no consistent changes were observed with the ADM motor units (n = 25). However, coherence analysis failed to reveal any consistent differences in the incidence of significant values of coherence spectrum between the pre-injection and injection periods among the motor unit pairs tested with either saline or L-Ac injections, in either the ECR or ADM muscles. The contrasting effects on the variability and the synchronization of the motor unit discharges observed with ECR motoneurones known to undergo recurrent inhibition and with ADM motoneurones known to lack recurrent inhibition suggest that the drug may have specific effects which are mediated by an enhancement of the Renshaw cell activity. The decrease in the ISI variability is in line with the hypothesis that recurrent inhibition may contribute along with the post-spike after-hyperpolarization to limiting the influence of the synaptic noise on the firing times of steadily discharging motoneurones. The present data, which suggest that recurrent inhibition plays a synchronizing rather than a desynchronizing role, are in keeping with the fact that the Renshaw cells may provide an important source of common inhibitory inputs.","","Acetylcarnitine; Action Potentials; Adult; Electromyography; Electrophysiology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Neurons; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Skeletal; Recruitment, Neurophysiological; Synapses; levacecarnine; sodium chloride; adult; afterhyperpolarization; article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; hypothesis; male; motoneuron; motor unit; motor unit potential; muscle isometric contraction; muscle perfusion; nerve cell membrane potential; noise; normal human; priority journal; recurrent inhibition; Renshaw cell; spike; synapse; abductor digiti minimi muscle; Article; cholinergic transmission; extensor carpi radialis muscle; hand muscle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037731342"

Very low leakage current was observed under high electric fields and the TiO2 thin films with various thicknesses showed dielectric constant of 25-30, which is more than 6 times as large as that of a usual SiO2 dielectric layer. This result indicates that TiO2 thin films synthesized at room temperature can replace with SiO2 layers currently employed for gate dielectrics of MOSFETs (MOS field-effect transistors).","Biomimetic; Gate Dielectric; Micropatterning; Self-Assembled Monolayers; Thin Films Titanium Dioxide","Biomimetic materials; Deposition; Leakage currents; MOSFET devices; Oxides; Permittivity; Self assembly; Surface chemistry; Thin films; Titanium dioxide; Gate dielectrics; Micropatterning; Dielectric materials","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0346885659"

It displays tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (f), minute ventilation (MV), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). The method is still unstandardised. The aim of this study was the selection of reliable ventilatory tests and its proper interpretation for early detection of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI) in spontaneously breathing patients with acute pulmonary disease. Patients and methods: After ventilatory function testing threshold values were determined for each index that discriminated best 45 patients with ARI and 41 patients without ARI. Operating lest characteristics were calculated and analysed with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, in which the proportions of true positive and false positive results are plotted against each other for a number of threshold values of the index. Index accuracy was reflected by the shape and position of the curve in a co-ordinate system. Curves for test usefulness determination, helpful in test in interpretation, were constructed with data for positive and negative predictive value and pre-test estimate of the disorder likelihood. Results: Threshold values VT < 300 ml, f > 32 breath/min, f/VT > 110 breath/min 1, FVC < 1500 ml, FEV1 < 900 ml are considered reliable. Breathing pattern parameters (VT, f, f/VT) showed high specificity (95, 90, 100%) but low sensitivity (51, 53, 60%) with many missed classifications (54, 57, 40%, mostly false negatives. Spirometric parameters (FVC, FEV1,) showed high sensitivity (91, 80% and specificity (88, 85%) with less missed classifications (21, 36%). Conclusions: FVC < 1500 ml was the most accurate predictor of ARI existence in spontaneously breathing patients with acute pulmonary disease, although breathing pattern parameters should not be rejected for respiratory monitoring in ICU. Prospective studies for different patient populations and test purposes are needed. This study has shown simplicity and reliability of this method of standardisation.","Acute respiratory insufficiency; Intensive care unit; Pulmonary function testing","acute respiratory failure; adult; aged; article; breathing rate; controlled study; female; forced expiratory volume; human; intensive care unit; lung disease; lung function test; major clinical study; male; tidal volume; vital capacity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029836837"

A story board is a sequence of graph snapshots showing the evolution of a graph based object structure during a typical example execution of an usecase. From such an example execution we automatically derive a test specification that executes the following three basic steps: First, a graph transformation is generated that creates an object structure serving as the test bed for the following steps. Second, we generate an operation that invokes the core method realizing the corresponding usecase. Third, we generate a graph test with a left-hand side corresponding to the graph structure described as result in the story board. On test execution, this graph test validates whether the object structure resulting from the usecase execution matches the results modeled in the usecase scenario. Support for this approach has been implemented within the Fujaba case tool. The approach has been validated in a major research project and in several student projects. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","","Graph theory; Graphic methods; Specifications; Graph structures; Graph Transformation; Object structure; Semi-automatics; Student project; Test execution; Test specifications; Tool support; Automatic test pattern generation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33644931731"

Further studies of an additional 309 units were conducted to determine if unit excitability and the response to clicks changed after Pavlovian conditioning in which blink responses were elicited by the clicks as conditioned stimuli. Over 50% of units tested before conditioning responded to click or hiss with increased activity, and 8% responded in the first 4-8 ms after the onset of the rapidly rising click. Cross-correlation of the respective 160 ms poststimulus histogram averages of mean activity showed dissimilar patterns of response to clicks and hisses (Pearson product- moment correlation coefficient + 0.02). Thus the averaged population responses distinguished these stimuli. In addition, individual cells were found in each behavioral state that responded selectively to either click or hiss. After conditioning with click as the conditioned stimulus, the number of units responding in the first 4-8 ms to click increased to 23%. The mean magnitude of activity 4-8 ms alter presenting the click increased after conditioning but not after sensitization produced by backward pairing of the stimuli used for conditioning. After backward pairing only 6% of the units responded in the first 4-8 ms to click. The changes in activity after conditioning were accompanied by increases in neural excitability to intracellularly applied depolarizing current. In contrast with the changes in activity, the increases in neural excitability were also found after backward pairing. We conclude that short as well as long latency acoustic transmissions to click change in the dentate nucleus after conditioning, that changes in response to click are expressed in 4-8 ms responsive cells, and that many of these cells have different patterns of spike activity in response to click and hiss. The findings support the hypothesis that the dentate nucleus can play a significant role in short as well as long latency, adaptive acoustic transmission that can enhance the response to an acoustic signal used as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus.","Auditory function; Hearing; Learning and memory; Primary sensory pathway; Subcerebellar nuclei; Systems and functions","Acoustic Stimulation; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Auditory Pathways; Behavior, Animal; Cats; Cerebellar Nuclei; Conditioning (Psychology); Synaptic Transmission; animal experiment; article; auditory stimulation; cat; conditioned reflex; dentate nucleus; learning; memory; nonhuman; perceptive threshold; priority journal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032489934"

Moreover, since these errors change over time due to temperature variations, real-time calibration is required.

The 66 spontaneously active neurons recorded had widely variable firing rates (mean 4.9 spikes/s, range 0.1-32.4 spikes/s) and variable temporal firing patterns (regular, bursting and random discharge). Interspike interval histograms were constructed for each unit and tested for goodness of fit to theoretical distributions. The activity of 23 units fitted gamma distributions, six units fitted lognormal distributions, three units fitted Weibull distributions, one unit fitted an exponential distribution and 11 units had bimodal distributions. Responses of some units to odour stimuli (Clove oil, Geraniol, Limonene and Ammonia all at 10% vapour saturation) delivered directly to the olfactory epithelium were examined. Odour stimulation modified spontaneous activity in 29 of the 44 units tested, causing either inhibition (56%) or excitation (44%) of firing. Of the 35 units stimulated with more than one odour, 15 responded to multiple stimuli, showing excitation or inhibition only or both inhibition and excitation, depending on the odour applied. Ammonia most commonly elicited a response (70% of applications) and all the odours were capable of inducing both inhibition and excitation of spontaneous firing. Examination of transverse sections of adult hen olfactory bulb in the region corresponding to the recording sites allowed unit recording depth to be related to cellular layers. There was some evidence of different neurone properties in each bulb layer. The spontaneous activity and odour responses observed resemble those seen in other vertebrate groups and the firing rates observed are between those previously reported for mammals and reptiles.

Band-pass tuning for sound duration has not been seen at lower levels of the auditory pathway. Previous work suggests that it arises at the IC through the interaction of sound-evoked, temporally offset, excitatory and inhibitory inputs. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from duration-tuned neurons in the IC and examined duration tuning before and after iontophoretic infusion of antagonists to γ-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) (bicuculline) or glycine (strychnine). The criterion for duration tuning was that the neuron's spike count as a function of duration had a peak value at one duration or a range of durations that was γ2 times the lowest nonzero value at longer durations. Out of 21 units tested with bicuculline, duration tuning was eliminated in 15, broadened in two, and unaltered in four. Out of 10 units tested with strychnine, duration tuning was eliminated in four, broadened in one, and unaltered in five. For units tested with both bicuculline and strychnine, bicuculline had a greater effect on reducing or abolishing duration tuning than did strychnine. Bicuculline and strychnine both produced changes in discharge pattern. There was nearly always a shift from an offset response to an onset response, indicating that in the predrug condition, inhibition arrived simultaneously with excitation or preceded it. There was often an increase in the length of the spike train, indicating that in the predrug condition, inhibition also coincided with later parts of excitation. These findings support two hypotheses. First, duration tuning is created in the IC. Second, although the construction of duration tuning varies in some details among IC neurons, it follows three rules: 1) an excitatory and an inhibitory event are temporally linked to the onset of sound but temporally offset from one another; 2) the duration of some inhibitory event must be linked to the duration of the sound; 3) an excitatory event must be linked to the offset of sound.","","4 aminobutyric acid; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor blocking agent; bicuculline methiodide; glycine; glycine receptor antagonist; strychnine; animal experiment; article; auditory nervous system; auditory stimulation; bat; female; inferior colliculus; male; nerve cell; nonhuman; priority journal; sound","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033818315"

By utilizing Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, a single radar chip has been developed which allows for the simultaneous operation of ultra-miniature, low-cost fuze sensors which are mounted onto the backside of each antenna element, obviating the need for RF switches and cabling. The MMIC described includes all the RF circuitry required to operate each radar sensor synchronously (phased-locked) to a common low frequency clock signal.

A slightly greater amount of synchrony was observed during hand clenching (0.042 ± 0.024 vs 0.035 ± 0.017 synchronous impulses per trigger). This trend did not reach however the level of significance and the changes were actually found to be heterogeneous: in 15 out of the 33 pairs tested, synchronous activity with a narrow coupling (4.6 ± 2.4 ms) consistent with short-term synchrony was greater during hand clenching whereas in nine other pairs, synchronous activity with a broader dispersion (9.0 ± 4.5 ms) was reduced. These opposite changes could not be explained in terms of changes in the firing pattern of the motor units and were found instead to correlate with the motor units' biomechanical properties. Motor units with high recruitment thresholds and fast rising twitches showed predominantly an increase in synchrony; whereas the motor unit pairs with low recruitment thresholds and slow twitches showed either an increase or a decrease. The enhanced short-term synchrony suggests that common inputs distributed to motoneurones of all types were more effective during hand clenching whereas the decrease in weakly coupled synchronous activity suggests that other inputs synchronized at a pre-synaptic level and distributed more specifically to motor units recruited at low force levels were less effective. The possible origins of the inputs reflected in the dual changes are discussed in terms of the supra-spinal and peripheral pathways controlling the wrist extensor motoneurones during wrist extension and hand clenching.","Co-contraction; Humans; Motor unit; Synchronization; Task-dependence; Wrist","adult; article; biomechanics; controlled study; extensor muscle; female; hand movement; human; human experiment; male; motor unit; nerve conduction; normal human; priority journal; task performance; wrist","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0034034149"

We examined the role of this cascade in mechanical sensitization of nociceptive neurons that innervate the meninges, a process thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of headache syndromes such as migraine. Single unit activity was recorded in the trigeminal ganglion from 40 mechanosensitive dural afferents (conduction velocitity: 0.3-6.6 in s-1) and nine mechanically insensitive dural afferents (MIAs) (conduction velocitity: 0.3-2.8 in s-1) while stimulating the dura with a servo force-controlled stimulator or von Frey monofilaments, respectively. Local application to the dura of dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP, 100 μM), a stable membrane-permeant cAMP analogue, produced mechanical sensitization in the majority of mechanosensitive units (19/29, 66%). Two distinct patterns of mechanical sensitization were observed. Thirty-eight per cent of the units exhibited only a decrease in threshold (TH group), while 28% showed only an increase in suprathreshold responses (STH group). dbcAMP also induced mechanosensitivity in the majority of MIA units (6/9, 67%). dbcAMP-induced sensitization was blocked by the PKA inhibitors, Rp-cAMP (1 mM) and H-89 (100 μM). A mixture of inflammatory mediators induced both components of sensitization in the majority of mechanosensitive units tested. However, in each unit, PKA inhibitors blocked only one of the two effects (either TH or STH). Units that were classified as TH or STH also differed in their baseline stimulus-response slopes, thresholds and conduction velocities. These findings implicate the cAMP-PKA cascade in sensitization of dural mechanonociceptors and suggest that this cascade may produce sensitization through at least two different mechanisms operating in separate neuronal populations.","","Animals; Bucladesine; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Differential Threshold; Dura Mater; Enzyme Activation; Inflammation Mediators; Male; Mechanoreceptors; Neural Conduction; Neurons, Afferent; Nociceptors; Physical Stimulation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Second Messenger Systems; Time Factors; Trigeminal Ganglion; bucladesine; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cyclic AMP derivative; cyclic AMP; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; headache; hyperalgesia; innervation; male; mechanical stimulation; meninx; migraine; nerve cell; nociceptive receptor; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; rat; second messenger; sensitization; sensory nerve conduction; single unit activity; trigeminus ganglion; adult; Article; cell population; enzyme activity; nerve conduction velocity; pain receptor; second messenger; sensitization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037082222"

We analyzed 38 units in 14 experiments. Units were initially located with the use of mechanical stimuli, and were then characterized by their conduction velocity and sensitivities to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Single unit recordings revealed innervation of dura and superior sagittal sinus by slowly conducting axons, mostly in the unmyelinated range. The receptive fields were 1-30 mm2, and typically had one to three punctate spots of highest sensitivity. All units tested responded to topical application of chemical agents. Ninety-seven percent of units responded to 10-5 M capsaicin, 79% responded to a mixture of inflammatory mediators, and 37% responded to an acidic buffer (pH 5). These data underline the importance of chemical sensitivity in intracranial sensation. Heat and cold stimuli evoked responses in 56 and 41% of units tested, respectively. Although the response patterns during heating were typical of polymodal nociceptors innervating other tissues, the thresholds were lower than for other tissues (32.342°C). Cooling led to a phasic discharge, with thresholds between 25 and 32°C. Although units had different combinations of responses to mechanical, chemical, and thermal stimuli, when grouped by their sensitivities the groups did not differ regarding mechanical thresholds or presence of ongoing activity. This suggests that meningeal primary afferents are relatively homogeneous. Sensitivities of these units are in general consistent with nociceptors, although the thermal thresholds differ. These data provide the first detailed report of response properties of intracranial primary afferent units, likely to be involved in transmission of nociception and possibly mediation of intracranial pain.","","animal experiment; article; controlled study; dura mater; guinea pig; mechanical stimulation; nerve cell stimulation; nerve conduction; nociception; nonhuman; priority journal; sensory nerve cell; thermal stimulation; trigeminal nerve","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031038062"

This may, however, result in increased end-to-end delays leading to violation of the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. In this paper, we propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) scheduling policies for centrally controlled TDD wireless systems. The proposed policies reduce the power consumption of mobile devices by putting them into low power mode intelligently, using probabilistic estimates of inactivity based on the previous traffic arrival pattern.

To assess how muscle ischaemia and isometric fatiguing contraction influence oxygen content in striated muscle. Methods. We simultaneously measured changes in hemoglobin near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and in surface EMG before, during, and after muscle ischaemia and ischaemia plus muscle isometric fatiguing contraction. Seventeen health male subjects (age range: 19-40 yrs) were examined in our Clinical Neurophysiology Unit. Test I (9 subjects): hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy and stimulated surface EMG were measured for 2 minutes at rest, for 4 minutes during complete ischaemia of tibialis anterior muscle, and for twelve minutes during recovery. Test II (all subjects): hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy and surface EMG were measured for 2 minutes with the subjects performing brief non-fatiguing contractions, for 4 minutes with the subject performing maximal isometric contraction in complete ischaemia, and for twelve minutes during recovery. EMG parameters measured: median density frequency (MDF); muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV). NIR spectroscopy parameters measured: percentage of amplitude decrement (%AD) and nadir time (NT) during ischaemia and ischaemic effort; half-recovery time ( 1/2 RT) from ischaemia effort. Results. At EMG, we observed a significant shift towards lower values of both MFCV and MDF during fatiguing isometric contraction. MDF recovery was faster then MFCV recovery. At NIR spectroscopy, the 1/2 RT slowed a fast pattern in twelve subjects and a slow pattern in five. A significant relationship was found between AD% and 1/2 RT values of test I and AD% and 1/2 values of test II. We found a positive relationship between NT and 1/2 RT in test II. Conclusions. Surface EMG and hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy can be applied simultaneously to evaluate both fatigue intensity and blood flow changes in striated muscle.","Electromyography methods; Muscle, skeletal blood supply; Myoelectrical signal; Spectroscopy, near infrared","Adult; Electromyography; Hemoglobins; Humans; Ischemia; Isometric Contraction; Male; Muscle Fatigue; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Consumption; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; oxygen; adult; article; electromyography; human; human experiment; infrared spectroscopy; male; muscle blood flow; muscle fatigue; muscle fiber membrane conductance; muscle ischemia; muscle isometric contraction; myoelectricity; normal human; oxygen supply; skeletal muscle; tibialis anterior muscle; vascularization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033056012"

Previous calibration studies of ultrasound units within the physical therapy communities in Scotland and Canada have shown that approximately two thirds of units tested did not conform to minimum calibration standards. Similar failure rates may exist in the chiropractic profession and need to be addressed. Objective: To determine whether ultrasound machines used by chiropractic physicians met established calibration and electrical safety standards, and to assess frequency of ultrasound therapy use. Design: This cross-sectional study tested 45 ultrasound units for ultrasonic output and electrical safety. Additionally, we asked the doctors to complete a short survey relating to education, usage, and maintenance of their ultrasound equipment. Results: Of the 45 machines tested, 44% failed either calibration or electrical safety inspection. Failure rate was age dependent (P ≤ .05). Only 2 of the 45 machines tested had been safety checked within the last year. Conclusions: A large percentage of ultrasound machines in chiropractic physicians' offices deliver too much or too little dosage to the patient. Electrical safety inspections also revealed a significant failure rate. Chiropractic physicians must become more aware of the requirement for yearly calibration and safety inspections, and understand that failure to maintain their equipment could result in loss of therapeutic effectiveness and pose a threat to the safety of their patients and staff.","Chiropractic; Equipment safety; Physician's practice patterns; Risk management; Standards; Ultrasonic therapy","age; article; calibration; clinical practice; electricity; human; machine; manipulative medicine; physiotherapy; professional practice; safety; standard; ultrasound therapy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0037366362"

We recorded single-unit activity from neurons of an output of the cerebellum, the fastigial nucleus, in two rhesus macaques while the monkeys tracked small moving targets with their eyes. Many neurons in the caudal part of the fastigial nucleus exhibited a modulation in their discharge rates when smooth-pursuit eye movements were elicited by either sinusoidal or step-ramp motions of a small target. 2. The pursuit direction that elicited the most vigorous modulation in unit firing to sinusoidal target motion could be horizontal, vertical, or oblique. Most often, the preferred direction was in the contralateral and/or downward direction (50 of 69 neurons) or in the ipsilateral and/or upward direction (13 of 69). 3. For units whose preferred smooth-pursuit directions were either contralateral/downward or ipsilateral/upward during sinusoidal pursuit, peak firing as measured by the phase shift of periodic modulation at 0.5-0.8 Hz occurred near the time of peak velocity. The discharge of 80% of the neurons with contralateral/downward preferred directions preceded eye velocity by an average of -27°; thus these neurons discharged maximally during eye acceleration. In contrast, neurons with ipsilateral/upward preferred directions lagged peak velocity by an average of +10.5° and therefore discharged during eye deceleration. 4. The average eye velocity sensitivity for sinusoidal pursuit between 0.5 and 0.8 Hz was 0.83 ± 0.57 (SD) spikes/s per °/s. We also tested 36 units during pursuit at a variety of frequencies in their preferred directions and found that firing rates increased monotonically with peak eye velocity. However, the firing rate saturated at velocities ranging from 20 to 60°/s for different units. 5. When a monkey tracked a step-ramp target motion, three discharge patterns emerged in the 27 units tested. Just over half of the units discharged a burst of spikes that preceded (average lead of 27.4 ± 17 ms) and lasted throughout the initial third of the eye acceleration; the burst was followed by a subsequent steady firing that continued after the eye had accelerated to its steady velocity. Fewer neurons discharged a burst that began late in the acceleration and was followed by steady firing. Occasional neurons showed only a gradual increase in firing rate during acceleration followed by a steady discharge. 6. Thirty of the 31 fastigial smooth-pursuit units tested also were modulated during sinusoidal yaw and/or pitch oscillations while the animals fixated a spot that rotated with them. Unlike floccular Purkinje cells, fastigial smooth- pursuit neurons often had unequal sensitivities to eye and head velocity. Approximately half had greater sensitivities to head velocity and half to eye velocity. 7. Our data suggest that the caudal fastigial nucleus may play a prominent role both in the initial acceleration of smooth pursuit and possibly in its maintenance. The existence in this same area of saccade- related neurons whose discharge is related to contralateral acceleration and ipsilateral deceleration suggests that the caudal fastigial nucleus may have a global role in the acceleration of all conjugate eye movements. In the DISCUSSION section we speculate about how the fastigial nucleus may exert this influence and how it may cooperate with the flocculus in the generation of pursuit eye movements.","","animal experiment; article; eye movement control; fastigial nucleus; motor nerve conduction; nerve potential; nonhuman; priority journal; rhesus monkey; saccadic eye movement; smooth muscle fiber membrane potential","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028148296"

Nigral pars reticulata units of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were classified into two types, showing regular and bursting discharge patterns, respectively ('non-burst' and 'burst' units). Non-burst and burst units showed distinct responses to intrastriatal quinpirole (the former were excited and burst units inhibited). Furthermore, subthalamic nucleus lesions significantly decreased the number of nigral units showing a spontaneous bursting pattern, and reduced the proportion of units that responded to quinpirole. In contrast, subthalamic lesions did not alter the proportion of nigral units that responded to SKF38393, although the lesions changed some response features, e.g. response type and magnitude. Burst analysis showed that quinpirole did not modify the discharge pattern of burst units, whereas SKF38393 produced a shift to regular firing in 62 of the burst units tested. In conjunction, our results support that: (i) the subthalamic nucleus has an important influence on output nuclei firing pattern; (ii) striatal D2 receptors have a strong influence on nigral firing rate, and a less relevant role in controlling firing pattern; (iii) burst and non-burst units differ in their response to selective stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors; (iv) the effects of striatal D2 receptors on nigral units are mainly, though not exclusively, mediated by the subthalamic nucleus; and (v) nigral responses to SKF38393 involve the subthalamic nucleus.","Burst pattern of activity; Dopamine receptors; In vivo electrophysiology; Parkinson's disease","(R)-2,3,4,5-Tetrahydro-8-chloro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepin-7-ol; 2,3,4,5-Tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine; Animals; Corpus Striatum; Dopamine Antagonists; Kainic Acid; Male; Neurons; Oxidopamine; Quinpirole; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Dopamine D2; Salicylamides; Substantia Nigra; Subthalamic Nucleus; 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 7,8 dihydroxy 1 phenyl 1h 3 benzazepine; dopamine 2 receptor; oxidopamine; quinpirole; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; brain injury; controlled study; male; nerve conduction; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; priority journal; rat; stimulation; substantia nigra; subthalamic nucleus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033957631"

However, distributed control makes it difficult to obtain the required frequency bandwidth considering the offered traffic and interference because there is no definite relationship between the base stations and the channels that they use. This paper proposes the virtual frequency reuse pattern, namely a virtual cluster size. The virtual cluster size gives the number of required control channels on a TDMA frame, assuming that once selected, the base station permanently uses the same control channel. The upper bound and the lower bound of the virtual cluster size are obtained theoretically and the practical virtual cluster size is obtained by computer simulations. Traffic channel assignment by dynamic channel allocation is designed for street microcellular systems as well. Both synchronized and asynchronized TDMA frames between base stations are discussed in this study. The optimum radio access method (TDMA/TDD or FDD) following all system conditions is reported in this paper.","","Communication channels (information theory); Computer simulation; Distributed parameter control systems; Frequency allocation; Multiplexing; Radio interference; Synchronization; Telecommunication control; Telecommunication traffic; Channel allocation; Control channels; Optimum radio access method; Street microcellular systems; Time division multiple access; Virtual cluster size; Virtual frequency reuse pattern; Cellular telephone systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028705525"

Taste responses in the NTS were recorded in anesthetized rats before and after adaptation of the tongue to NaCl, HCl, sucrose or quinine. Results showed that the magnitude of response to test stimuli following adaptation was a function of the context, i.e., adaptation condition, in which the stimuli were presented. Over half of all taste responses were either attenuated or enhanced following the adaptation procedure: NaCl adaptation produced the most widespread, non-stimulus-selective cross-adaptation and sucrose adaptation produced the least frequent cross-adaptation and the most frequent enhancement of taste responses. Adaptation to quinine cross-adapted to sucrose and adaptation to HCl cross-adapted to quinine in over half of the units tested. The adaptation procedure sometimes unmasked taste responses where none were present beforehand and sometimes altered taste responses to test stimuli even though the adapting stimulus did not itself produce a response. These effects demonstrated a form of context-dependency of taste responsiveness in the NTS and further suggest a broad potentiality in the sensitivity of NTS units across taste stimuli. Across unit patterns of response remained distinct from each other under all adaptation conditions. Discriminability of these patterns may provide a neurophysiological basis for residual psychophysical abilities following adaptation.

The costs in terms of depot repair and user exchange dollars that are wasted annually for unresolved cases are graphically illustrated. A diagnostic data model is presented, which automatically captures, archives and statistically processes test parameters and failure results which are then used to determine if an NFF at the next testing level resulted from a test anomaly. The model includes statistical process methods, which produce historical trend patterns for each part and serial numbered unit tested. An Expert System is used to detect statistical pattern changes and stores that information in a knowledge base. A Decision Support System (DSS) provides advisories for engineers and technicians by combining the statistical test pattern with unit performance changes in the knowledge base.

Your team has limited understanding of the system, and unit tests are missing for many, if not all, of the components.

All of these are signs of software that is close to the breaking point.Many systems can be upgraded or simply thrown away if they no longer serve their purpose. Legacy software, however, is crucial for operations and needs to be continually available and upgraded. How can you reduce the complexity of a legacy system sufficiently so that it can continue to be used and adapted at acceptable cost?Based on the authors' industrial experiences, this book is a guide on how to reverse engineer legacy systems to understand their problems, and then reengineer those systems to meet new demands. Patterns are used to clarify and explain the process of understanding large code bases, hence transforming them to meet new requirements. The key insight is that the right design and organization of your system is not something that can be evident from the initial requirements alone, but rather as a consequence of understanding how these requirements evolve. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

A feature of the experiments was the stimulation paradigm used. In order to control the peristimulus firing rate, a computer triggered the stimulus isolator only when 2 interspike intervals of specified duration occurred in succession. In addition, the timing of the stimulus in relation to the preceding action potential was controlled in a manner similar to a conditioning/testing paradigm. The general pattern of response was an initial, ""H-reflex"" excitation at monosynaptic latency, followed first by a silent period due to the refractoriness of the motor neurone, then by other phases of reduced activity. When the stimulus intensity was increased, the intensity of the excitation and the duration of the silent period increased in parallel. When the pre-stimulus firing rate of the motor unit was varied, the amplitude of the H-reflex response, normalized to the number of stimulus trials, was similar at 6, 8 and 10 Hz, but was greater at 4 Hz in most units tested. These findings were consistent with a simple model of the events occurring at the cell membrane in this reflex which was proposed by Ashby and Zilm (1982a), although some modification of the model was necessary to account for the different response at 4 Hz.

Studies were made of quality coding in the olfactory lobe of the insect by recording extracellular action potentials from single cells.   2. Listing cell spectra permits to distinguish two main groups of cells, namely, ‘odour specialist’ which respond very specifically to biologically important substances and ‘odour generalist’ which respond to a large variety of odorants (thirty‐two compounds) in an excitatory or inhibitory manner, or not responding at all.   3. Among more than fifty cells of the ‘odour generalists’, very few had similar, or identical, reaction spectra to an arbitrarily chosen set of thirty‐two odorants, while the ‘odour specialists’ are like each other in their response spectra.   4. There was an indication of a regional and layer differentiation of response in the lobe to the sex attractant.   5. ‘On’, ‘on—off’, and ‘off’ response types, as well as several variations on these response types, were found in single units during odour presentations.   6. Differences in patterning of excitation for each of the thirty‐two compounds can be readily detected by the comparison of the relative amounts of activity in each of the eighty‐one units tested. It is therefore concluded that the mechanism of odour encoding at the olfactory lobe may involve the linear combinations of every olfactory neurone's activity result ing in a unique across‐lobe pattern of discharges (‘odour code pattern’) for each particular odorant.   7. If it follows that odour discrimination by the lobe depends on such differences of ‘odour code patterns’, it would be possible then to distinguish very many odorants simply by having very many neurones possessing differential odour specificity.  © 1971 The Physiological Society","","Acetic Acids; Action Potentials; Animal; Female; Insects; Ketones; Limbic System; Male; Neurons; Odors; Olfactory Nerve; Pheromones; acetic acid derivative; ketone; pheromone; action potential; animal; article; female; insect; limbic system; male; nerve cell; odor; olfactory nerve; physiology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0015041277"

The vagus nerve was sectioned below the nodose ganglion and its central end anastomosed with the peripheral end of the spinal accessory nerve, which innervates the trapezius and mastoido‐humeral muscles. Fifty‐three vagal efferent units recorded were identified and classified into seven distinguishable types on the basis of their temporal relationship with gastric movements. With respect to their patterns of discharge during the primary cycles type I to type V units were similar to units of the corresponding types described by Iggo & Leek (1967a) in anaesthetized sheep. Evidence for the hypothesis that each type of gastric unit innervates a distinct region of the reticulo‐rumen is strongest for types I and IV. Type I units which exhibited a bimodal pattern of discharge closely associated with reticular motility, are presumed to innervate the reticulum. Some of them, so‐called Ib because of their second burst with a long tail and their activity during the secondary cycles, are considered to activate the zone of attachment of the reticulum to the rumen. Type IV units which were active during the ruminal contractions of both primary and secondary cycles are considered to innervate the dorsal rumen. Discharges in these gastric units were observed when gastric motility was partially or totally abolished after administering autonomic blocking drugs for each unit tested (n = 25). They consisted of (i) a shortening of intervals between the onset of two successive bursts, and (ii) an increase in the duration of discharge and the number of potentials in the efferent units. As the abolition of gastric motility led to a decrease of gastric afferent input, these results suggest that the gastric centres are under a permanent inhibitory influence from the afferent drive. © 1989 The Physiological Society","","Action Potentials; Animal; Efferent Pathways; Nerve Regeneration; Sheep; Stomach; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vagus Nerve; atropine; hexamethonium; neostigmine; animal experiment; controlled study; electromyography; newborn; nonhuman; sheep; stomach motility; stomach reflux; vagus nerve","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024371898"

In this investigation we demonstrate that these same deep tectal neurons respond equally well to kinematograms as they do to traditional luminance contrast stimuli typically employed in visual experiments. Computer generated kinematograms, the motion domain equivalents of random dot stereograms, were used as stimuli in these experiments. These kinematograms, where a small centrally located set of random dots is moved coherently in one direction while the remaining dots are moved in a different direction, thus constitute a pure motion stimulus where the stimulus form is only visible in the dynamic pattern, but does not exist on any single frame. Both 'object' configured and 'hole' configured kinematograms were employed; the former appearing as regions of texture moving over, or in front of, the background texture, while the latter appear as windows through which a more distant textured surface is revealed. Extracellular recordings from isolated deep tectal cells showed that all units responded in a very similar manner whether the stimulus was an 'object' configured kinematogram or the more traditional luminance contrast variety. This similarity included directional selectivity, the in-phase inhibition anti-phase facilitation effect, and sensitivity to opposed motion independent of direction. However, when the kinematograms were configured as 'holes' none of the units tested responded to these stimuli.

This possibility was investigated by searching for single units in the medial and lateral septal nuclei responding to activation of baroreceptors, elicited either by electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve (ADN) or by systemic injection of phenylephrine (PE), or responding to activation of chemoreceptors, elicited by intracarotid injection of sodium cyanide. Fifty-four male Wistar rats weighing 300-400 g were anesthetized with urethan (1.4 g/kg ip) or α-chloralose-urethan (35 and 400 mg/kg ip, respectively) and allowed to breathe spontaneously. One-third of spontaneously firing units tested responded to ADN stimulation; these 93 units were divided into two groups according to their response patterns; 62 (67%) showed an increase and 31 (33%) a decrease in their discharge. Of 35 units tested, 6 responded to intravenous injection of PE. The majority of the units (48 of 60) affected by chemoreceptor activation were excited, and the remaining 12 were inhibited.

In all 20 healthy subjects the early spinal response (mean latency 31.5 ms) was followed by a reproducible later reflex response with a mean latency of 56.5 ms. The activity pattern of single motor units of the stretched muscle was similar to that of the surface EMG. Thus all single motor units tested could be active during either the first or second response phase, but never in both in a given trial. Of the 50 patients with HD, the late EMG response was missing completely in all but 7, but the early spinal component was almost identical to that of the control group. Double stretches at an interval of 25 ms evoked two similar EMG responses in these patients, proving that the motoneuron pool is still excitable during the time at which the second response would have appeared in healthy subjects.The reflex responses of the thenar muscles evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve were examined during a voluntary opposing contraction of the thumb in both groups of subjects. In normal subjects, two EMG responses could be distinguished with latencies similar to those of the mechanically elicited responses. Patients with HD again lacked the second response, although the first spinal response was always present.

With mechanical search stimuli, 150 slowly adapting units were identified, 88% C-fibers, and the remainder, Aδ-fibers. The majority of these units (65%) were categorized as mechano-heat sensitive ('polymodal') with controlled radiant heat stimulation. The remaining units were classified as low- or high-threshold mechanoreceptors according to their von Frey thresholds. Bradykinin (BK), in concentrations of 10-8 to 10-4 M, was repeatedly applied for 1 min at 10-min intervals. Fifty-six percent of the polymodal C-fibers responded to BK (up to 10-5 M), in contrast to 17% of the heat-insensitive units (P < 0.01). No correlation between BK sensitivity and conduction velocity or von Frey threshold was found. The Bk 'threshold concentrations' to excite C- and Aδ-fibers were about equally distributed over a range from 10-8 to 10-5 M. There was a large interindividual variability in pattern and magnitude of the response to BK. Intraindividually, a marked tachyphylaxis upon repeated BK stimulation was observed. In fibers with a slow development of tachyphylaxis, the effects of conditioning application of different chemicals on BK responsiveness were studied. Norepinephrine in 10-7 M concentration did not produce a significant effect, whereas 10-5 M and 10-4 M seemed to increase the BK responses. Prostaglandin E2 (10-6 M) caused a weak sensitization to BK on average (n.s.), but serotonin (10-6 M) was clearly effective (P < 0.05). The strongest sensitization to BK (P = 0.01) resulted from conditioning heat stimulation, which also uncovered a responsiveness in some units initially insensitive to BK. In some experiments the calcium concentration in the superfusate of receptive fields was lowered to 0.3 mM, which induced ongoing activity in C-fibers and markedly increased the BK responses in two polymodal units tested. Increasing the calcium concentration to 3.0 mM reversed these effects. After completing the BK test protocol, polymodal C-fibers were exposed to other chemicals. All BK-sensitive units tested were also excited by capsaicin (10-5 M), 75% by histamine (10-4 M) and 43% by serotonin (10-5 M). Among the BK-insensitive units, only one of seven fibers was excited by histamine, none by serotonin, and only three of six units by capsaicin. Heat thresholds of C-fibers treated with and sensitive to BK were significantly lower than those of BK-insensitive or untreated units. Irrespective of any chemical treatments, the von Frey thresholds of all units remained essentially unchanged throughout the experiments.","","bradykinin; capsaicin; histamine; noradrenalin; prostaglandin E2; serotonin; animal cell; article; chemoreceptor; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; sensory nerve; skin","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025274415"

Receptive fields covered approximately a quadrant of the corneal surface and showed continuous sensitivity and overlapping. Units were silent in the absence of stimulation but an ongoing activity was commonly present after repeated mechanical and thermal stimulation. 3. Mechanical responses were evoked at low thresholds and consisted of a dynamic and static response that paralleled the amplitude of the stimulus. The pattern of the discharge was irregular and fatigue was easily developed by repeated stimulation. 4. Thresholds to heating were above 38 degrees C and the response increased monotonically with the temperature over the range from threshold to 50 degrees C.

The responses of polymodal nociceptors with unmyelinated (C) fibers of the rabbit's great auricular nerve were examined with and without intermittent stimulation of the ipsilateral cervical sympathetic trunk. The receptive field of each polymodal nociceptor was heated twice in a stepwise manner from 30 to 50 or 55°C in 5°C steps. For each unit, one heating trial was a control trial and the other was accompanied by sympathetic stimulation. The order of the control and sympathetic stimulation trials and the maximum testing temperature were varied systematically among the units examined. 2. The initial responses of polymodal nociceptors in the first heating trial in the presence of sympathetic stimulation were similar to the responses of units whose first heating was a control trial. Units whose receptive fields were tested to a maximum temperature of 50°C in the first trial displayed enhanced responses to heat in their second trial (sensitization), while units tested initially to 55°C responded less briskly during their second heating trial (depression). However, the occurrence of sympathetic stimulation in the second heating trials had no apparent effect on the responses to heat of sensitized or depressed elements. Alterations in the numbers of impulses, instantaneous frequency, or pattern of impulse activity of individual units could not be attributed to sympathetic stimulation. It was concluded that the heat sensitivity of C polymodal nociceptors is not modified by efferent sympathetic activity under the conditions examined in this study.","","animal cell; animal experiment; autonomic nervous system; histology; motor nerve; nerve fiber C; nervous system; nociceptive receptor; nonhuman; peripheral nervous system; preliminary communication; priority journal; sympathetic tone","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022397949"

Unitary activities of muscular thin fibre afferents, which were not sensitive to muscle stretching, were recorded from the nerve of the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the dog. Responses to mechanical stimulation, intra‐arterial injection and local application of chemical solutions, and thermal stimulation of the surface of the muscle were studied. It was observed that polymodal receptors which responded to all types of stimulation existed in the thin fibre afferents of the muscle.   2. The receptive area of these units tested by mechanical stimulation was spot‐like and appeared to be located not only on the surface but in the midst of the muscle.   3. The mechanical response varied among these units with respect to the threshold and the pattern of discharges.   4. In these units, NaCl, KCl, and bradykinin consistently evoked responses, with differences in the latencies and discharge patterns, while solutions of histamine, acetylcholine and sodium citrate caused responses less consistently and less effectively. In the stretch receptors, chemical stimulation applied in the same way as tested in the thin fibre afferents produced quite different features in their responses.   5. Heating the receptive area of the muscle surface caused responses in twenty‐five out of thirty‐six units, which were sensitive both to mechanical and to chemical stimulations. The threshold varied from 38·0 to 48·3 °C, with a mean of 43·1 °C for C fibre units and 41 °C for A‐δ fibre units.   6.

Monaural and binaural neurophysiological data were obtained from 264 units in the medullary and mesencephalic levels of the central auditory system in the CF-FM bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, using earphones for acoustically separated stimulation of the two ears. 2. The units responded to pure tones delivered at their best frequencies with typical basic patterns (PST-histograms) which were classified according to the literature. 3. The latencies of the units' responses changed systematically with the recording depth from about 8 to 1.5ms when passing from the inferior colliculus at the brain's surface through the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus down to the superior olivary complex. 4. Best frequencies covered almost the whole hearing range from 2kHz up to 96kHz, but 50% of all units lay between 75 and 85kHz, the animal's best hearing range, the emission frequency of orientation sounds being between 82 and 84kHz (CF-part). 5. All lowest thresholds of single units put together demonstrate an almost perfect fitting with the behavioural hearing curve. 6. Monaural excitatory impulse count functions were mostly monotonic but many were very non-monotonic and intermediate. 7. The binaural classification (Table 1) confirmed the classical concept of the pathway and the theory of binaural interaction. The most frequently observed types were E/I (ipsilateral inhibitory, contralateral excitatory; 53 %) and E/E (both sides excitatory; 22%). 8. In all cases tested so far, best frequencies and tuning curves were the same for both sides regardless of the kind of binaural interaction. 9. The most interesting units found (13% of the total) showed together with binaural inhibition, strong facilitation in certain ranges of their dynamic range thus reinforcing the response to particular stimulus combinations. These units may be called directional specialists, useful for angular sensitivity. 10. The excitatory impulse count functions were usually steep covering a best dynamic range of 10-30dB, whereas inhibitory curves were much flatter but covered a wide dynamic range of 30-100dB. 11. Since therefore the excitatory influence is always predominant in any unit tested, coding of the sound direction is ambiguous when the absolute intensity is altered. Hence the response is not only a function of the interaural intensity difference as postulated by the theory, but also dependent upon absolute intensity levels. Neural mechanisms to compensate such ambiguities in presumably higher centers are postulated and discussed. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0000181201"

In addition, responses of Pt and NRTP neurons to pure vestibular stimuli (rotation in the dark) were studied. 2) Pt neurons showed seven response types to optokinetic stimulation (Table 1). The most frequent response (48%) consisted of a very rapid increase in firing to steady state on temporonasal motion stimulation of the contralateral eye; nasotemporal stimuli yielded no change in resting rate as did stimulation of the ipsilateral eye. The response maximum occurred at a retinal slip velocity of 1 deg/s. None of the Pt units tested responded to pure vestibular stimuli. 3) NRTP neurons - as Pt units - most frequently (43%) increased their discharge rate on temporonasal stimulation of the contralateral eye and maintained a constant resting rate during nasotemporal motion. Peak response amplitudes also occurred with retinal slip velocities of 1 deg/s. Contrary to the fast time-to-peak of the responses of Pt neurons NRTP units showed a slow rise in frequency of firing to peak response levels. 4) NRTP neurons responded to pure vestibular stimuli (horizontal angular acceleration in the dark). The vestibular responses were synergistic with those evoked in the same neurons by optokinetic stimuli. Thus, the most frequently encountered type of optokinetic response (s. above) showed a type II vestibular response. 5) Comparison of OKN and Vn optokinetic responses with those of Pt and NRTP suggests that the unidirectional-selective Pt and NRTP neurons are important links in the central optokinetic path.

Of the PVN units, 98 projected to the neurohypophysis but none of these neurosecretory neurones were found to simultaneously project to extrahypothalamic areas. From the firing patterns and the response of these neurons to suckling, haemorrhage or osmotic stimuli both 'vasopressinergic' and 'oxytocinergic' neurones were identified. We found 43 PVN units to project to the NTS/VC and 22% of tested neurones were activated by osmotic or haemorrhage stimuli; no phasic activity was associated with this activation. The suckling stimulus failed to elicit any response from these units. Upon testing the PVN units that projected to the amygdala (n = 35), it was found that haemorrhage and suckling stimuli were without effect, while the osmotic stimulus activated one of 6 units tested. Thus, the extrahypothalamic PVN projections examined in this study were not associated with the suckling reflex response, although there is evidence for their limited involvement in neural response to osmotic or haemorrhage stimuli. © 1985.","arginine-vasopressin; oxytocin; paraventricular nucleus","Amygdala; Animal; Animals; Animals, Suckling; Brain; Evoked Potentials; Female; Hemorrhage; Medulla Oblongata; Neurons; Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus; Pituitary Gland, Posterior; Rats; Rats, Inbred Strains; Sodium Chloride; Stimulation, Chemical; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Synaptic Transmission; Vagus Nerve; oxytocin; vasopressin; animal experiment; bleeding; blood and hemopoietic system; brain depth recording; breast; central nervous system; endocrine system; hypothalamus periventricular nucleus; nervous system; neurosecretion; nonhuman; osmotic stimulation; priority journal; rat; suckling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022391763"

Second, the shapes of degenerate atomic ground states appropriate for optimal interatomic interactions, giving rise to the novel ""chemical deformation density"" (CDD). Third, the genuine chemical deformation of the atoms in the molecule or crystal. This approach was applied to more than 40 molecules consisting mainly of second-row atoms (lithium to fluorine) and hydrogen. Contrary to the standard TDD, the novel CDD gives a very consistent pattern of covalent bond and lone pair densities, even for electron-rich atoms. The atomic shape parameters comprise valence atomic orbital directions and populations.

The responses consisted of single and multiple spikes that showed slight variability in the latency, indicating orthodromic activation via a synapse in ~98% of the responses recorded. Forty two percent of the units tested showed evidence of convergence of input from vagal afferent fibers in different branches of the ventral vagal trunk that served the proximal stomach.

In addition, the sucking pattern of term neonates during a feeding regimen commonly used in many feeding studies was evaluated (reservoir nipple system). In this system milk flows from a reservoir through a tube and depends on the sucking pressure generated by the infant. Only the Enfamil single-hole nipple units for term and preterm infants were compared in preterm infants. No significant difference in sucking frequency was observed in term neonates with different types of nipple units. Although the mean sucking pressures generated tended to be less among nipple units with higher flow, these differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, no significant difference in total sucking or feeding time was observed among the three nipple units tested. Sucking pressures generated by term infants were significantly less when milk flow was increased markedly utilizing the reservoir system. In preterm infants no differences in sucking frequency, sucking pressure, mean flow, or total feeding time were observed when sucking patterns with term and preterm nipple units were compared.

Comparability of the evoked potentials under the two conditions served as justification for correlating patterns of single unit responses and perceptual responses to pairs of flashes. Under light adaptation, unit recovery to paired flashes at various interflash intervals was comparable to evoked potential recovery and, hence, to the perceptual responses in only about one-half of the units tested. In contrast, under dark adapted conditions, only one-third of the units paralleled the evoked potentials. Thus, a large number of retinal units apparently fail to play a significant role in temporal discrimination of paired from single flashes.

An inverse correlation has, for instance, been found between the amount of artificially induced α-damage and the TL sensitivity (i.e. the TL output per unit test dose of γ-rays). As the degree of damage in natural samples of sphene (gauged by their fossil fission tracks) was varied by means of annealing for 1 h at various temperatures, it was found that there were two phases which characterized the pattern of the TL sensitivity. A comparison was made of the effect of annealing on the TL sensitivity of natural samples and that of aliquots from the same samples which had been completely annealed and then irradiated with (i) ∼30 MeV α-particles at a fluence of up to 1016 α cm-2 from a cyclotron, and (ii) reactor thermal neutrons to induce fission in the U-contents of the crystals. It was found that the TL sensitivity of artificially damaged samples exhibited patterns broadly similar to those of natural samples.

Conduction velocities, determined from electrical stimulation of receptive fields (RFs), were in the range for unmyelinated C fibers (mean=0.82 m/s,n=20;SD=±0.17). With two exceptions cutaneous RFs were single spots (median = 2 mm2; n=37) and usually were identical for thermal and mechanical stimuli. The median force threshold for the sample of units was 1.2 g (von Frey technique; n = 39; range = 0.07-8.5 g). Discharges to thermal stimuli were investigated with a feedback controlled contact thermode which permitted temperature changes ≤12.0°C/s. Thermal thresholds ranged from 38° to 49°C (median=46°C; n=37), and maximum discharge frequencies were obtained in the noxious heat range (45-55°C). For a graded series of 5 s duration stimuli from an adapting temperature of 35°C, the number of impulses increased as a monotonic function of stimulus intensity over the range from threshold temperature to 50-53°C. Many stimulus response functions were positively accelerated and linear regression analyses showed that most units examined were best fit by nonlinear functions. The typical pattern of activity to 5 s duration temperature shifts into the noxious heat range was a short accelerating burst of impulses followed by deceleration to a lower rate of discharge prior to termination of the stimulus. The temporal profile of the discharge of impulses was virtually identical at different adapting temperatures. In units tested with 30 s duration stimuli at 2-6°C above threshold, the mean frequency of discharge during the final 25 s was 1.46 impulses/s (n=6; SD=±0.89). Application of noxious heat stimuli a few degrees above threshold temperature typically sensitized or enhanced the response of the unit to subsequent application of heat stimuli. The signs of sensitization consisted of a decrease in threshold temperature, increased frequency of discharge, decreased latency to the first impulse, and afterdischarges. Units failed to respond throughout the duration of 30 s stimuli if the final temperature exceeded 50°C. Depressed responses were sometimes produced by application of intense (≥55°C) stimuli, presumably as a result of partial inactivation of the receptor. In a correlative analysis, the latency and pattern of discharge in a sample of units were compared with escape responses in two monkeys to temperature shifts into the noxious heat range (49 and 51°C). The analysis revealed that the discharge of C polymodal nociceptors alone cannot account for fast escape responses, but the discharge may contribute to escape responses which occur more than 3.5 s after the onset of stimulation.","","phencyclidine; face; monkey; nociceptive receptor; nociceptive stimulation; theoretical study; thermal stimulation; trigeminus ganglion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0017031324"

The effects of lesions in both human and nonhuman primates have implicated the cerebellum in the control of rapid eye movements, i.e., saccades. To examine the neural substrate of this control, we recorded the discharge patterns of cerebellar output cells in the fastigial nucleus while monkeys tracked a small, jumping spot of light. 2. In the caudal fastigial nucleus, neurons discharged for saccades in one or several directions. All exhibited a burst. Some also exhibited a saccade-related pause in firing either before or after saccades greater than ~3-5°. Thirty-seven percent discharged only a burst, 44% also exhibited a pause before bursts in certain directions, and 19% also paused after the saccade-related burst in certain directions. Although many cells discharged steadily during intersaccadic intervals, few exhibited a robust relation between firing rate and eye position. 3. As a measure of directional selectivity, we plotted the burst lead time as a function of saccade direction for saccades of similar (10°) radial amplitudes. Of 20 neurons tested, 17 burst earliest for contralateral saccades and 1 for upward saccades; 2 others showed little dependence on direction. Of 19 additional units tested only in the horizontal direction, 18 burst earlier for contralateral saccades. 4. For contralateral saccades the burst preceded saccades of all sizes by at least 7.7 ms on average. For ipsilateral saccades, the burst preceded small saccades by an average of 10.3 ms. However, as ipsilateral saccade size increased, the burst began later and later relative to saccade onset so that, on average, it always occurred after the onset of 20° saccades but well before the saccade ended. 5. Many fastigial saccade-related units showed increases in the number of spikes with saccade size and in burst duration with saccade duration in one or more directions. For either relation the highest average correlation coefficients ranged from 0.6 to 0.65. In general, the average correlation coefficients and slopes for either relation were slightly larger for contralateral saccades. Pure burst neurons did not display better average correlations than neurons that also paused. For neurons that also paused either before or after saccades, there was a weak tendency for pause duration to increase with the duration of larger saccades. 6. We tested the effect of eye position on unit discharge in 13 cells by requiring the monkey to make 10° ipsilateral and contralateral saccades from a variety of starting positions. Eight of the neurons exhibited clear qualitative differences in either the burst characteristics, the presence of an accompanying pause, or the intersaccadic steady firing rate for different starting positions. However, only 2 of the 13 exhibited at least 1 correlation coefficient between burst parameters and starting position of 0.8 or more; 7 additional cells had at least 1 coefficient in excess of 0.4. The correlations with starting position did not improve when we sorted saccades into centrifugal and centripetal movements. 7. The saccade-related discharge of fastigial neurons was anything but machinelike. For some units, saccades of the same size and starting position were accompanied by bursts of widely differing frequencies and durations. In addition, alertness and/or attention appeared to affect the saccadic responses. 8. Nevertheless, our data suggest that the fastigial nucleus is involved in helping to accelerate contralateral saccades and in helping to decelerate ipsilateral ones. If this is true, lesions of the fastigial nucleus should cause contralateral saccades to become hypometric and ipsilateral saccades to become hypermetric. The pharmacological inactivations of the fastigial nucleus reported in the companion paper produced just such deficits.","","alertness; animal tissue; article; attention; cerebellum; electrostimulation; epileptic discharge; eye position; fastigial nucleus; human; human tissue; motion; nonhuman; priority journal; regression analysis; REM sleep; rhesus monkey; saccadic eye movement; visual field","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027372453"

Haenny et al. (1988) reported that the activity of neurons in area V4 of monkeys performing an orientation matching task depends on the orientation for which the animal is searching. It was proposed that these neurons contribute to a representation of the orientation being sought. We have further characterized these neurons by recording visual responses from individual neurons during multiple behavioral tasks. Animals were trained to perform an orientation match-to-sample task using either a visual or a tactile orientation sample. In a set of 89 neurons examined using both types of sample, 25% showed statistically significant effects of sample orientation regardless of whether the sample was visual or tactile. Most of these preferred the same sample orientation in both conditions. These results allow us to specify the nature of the information signaled by these neurons more precisely than has previously been possible. For 193 units tested using one of the matching tasks, responses were also recorded while the animal performed a simple fixation task. In this task the animal was not required to attend to the visual stimuli that were presented. A few neurons that were responsive during the matching task were silent during fixation, but a comparable number was much more responsive during fixation. Across the whole population there was no systematic change in either responsivity or selectivity for orientation under the two conditions. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Stable extracellular unitary recordings were made from 138 cerebellar interpositus nuclear neurones (IPNs) in awake cats. Mean background discharge, in animals in a state of relaxed wakefulness and in the absence of overt movement, was 41·0±2·6 impulses/sec (mean± s.e.m).    2. Animals were trained to accept a variety of sensory testing procedures without producing detectable motor reactions. Mechanical taps (1 mm amplitude; 20 msec overall duration) applied to the main pads or dorsal surfaces of the forepaws and/or hind paws modified discharge in forty‐eight of 110 IPNs tested. Response patterns to taps generally comprised one or more of three basic components, namely: short‐latency excitation, e1, at onset latencies of 13·0±0·9 msec (mean± s.e.m.) for ipsilateral forepaw (iF) and 17·0±0·7 msec for ipsilateral hind paw (iH); a period of reduced discharge, at latencies 25·6±2·6 msec for iF and 32·3±2·1 msec for iH; a delayed acceleration of discharge, e2, at latencies 47·4±4·6 msec for iF and 46·4±4·1 msec for iH. The component e1 was the most common (present in 80% of responses) and e2 the least common (present in 18% of responses).    3. The majority (> 70%) of responses of IPNs to tap stimulation of the paws comprised net excitation.    4. Convergence of tap‐evoked sensory input from iF and iH on to individual IPNs was evident in eight of the thirty‐five units tested with stimulation of both afferent sites.    5. Approximately one third of IPNs so tested were sensitive to passive manipulation of limb joints in the quiet, awake cat. Sixteen of the forty‐three IPNs so tested responded to displacement of the ipsilateral wrist and/or elbow joints and three of ten IPNs so tested responded to movement of contralateral forepaw joints. Corresponding proportions of IPNs responding to passive ankle and/or knee joint displacements were sixteen of thirty‐six units tested and three of three units tested for ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws respectively. Convergence of input generated by manipulation of iF and iH joints on to individual IPNs was apparent in only three of twenty‐four units tested at each site.    6. Tactile stimulation (brushing fur, gentle pressure on the skin) of iF influenced discharge in twelve of thirty‐seven IPNs tested and comparable iH‐related cutaneous sensory fields were found for fourteen of twenty‐eight IPNs tested.    7. The modulations of discharge of IPNs associated with active movements of the stimulated limb were usually far more pronounced than those elicited by somatosensory stimulation in the quiet, relaxed animal.    8. Responses of IPNs to natural somatosensory stimulation in the awake cat are compared with those previously described for anaesthetized or decerebrate preparations and with those found for electrical stimulation of cutaneous nerves in awake cats. In general IPN response patterns to precisely timed tap stimulation of the paws in the awake animal closely resembled those that would have been predicted from the earlier studies, although the time course of responses differed in certain respects.   © 1981 The Physiological Society","","Animal; Cats; Cerebellar Cortex; Consciousness; Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; Female; Male; Mechanoreceptors; Movement; Neural Conduction; Neural Inhibition; Neurons; Physical Stimulation; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; animal; article; cat; cerebellum cortex; consciousness; evoked somatosensory response; female; male; mechanoreceptor; movement (physiology); nerve cell; nerve cell inhibition; nerve conduction; physiology; stimulation; animal experiment; brain depth recording; central nervous system; cerebellum; interpositus nucleus; tactile stimulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0019731396"

During these isometric and auxotonic muscle contractions, electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded with electrode pairs in up to 12 independent forearm muscles. Spike-triggered averages (STAs) of rectified EMG activity were used to identify afferents that were associated with correlated facilitation of active muscles. Our aim was to find peripheral afferents producing postspike effects in muscles and to compare their properties with those of corticomotoneuronal (CM) and rubromotoneuronal (RM) cells previously obtained under identical behavioral conditions. We documented the timing, magnitude and distribution of their postspike facilitation (PSF) of forearm muscles and investigated the response properties of task-related units. Of 125 afferent units tested with STAs, 68 showed PSF of EMG activity in at least one muscle. Fifty-nine DRG units provided sufficiently long recordings to generate averages with ≥2,000 triggers, the minimum number considered to demonstrate reliable effects. Of these 59 units, 29 (49%) were associated with facilitation of forearm muscle activity. Many STAs showed a gradual increase in EMG activity starting before or near the afferent trigger spike; often superimposed on this broad facilitation was a sharply rising PSF starting at a longer latency. The earliest poststimulus facilitation evoked by single microstimuli delivered in DRG occurred in stimulus-triggered averages at a latency of 3.5 ms. In STAs the broad facilitation beginning at latencies shorter than the responses to electrical stimulation was attributed to synchronous discharges in other afferent units. The sharper postspike EMG increases occurring with latencies of ≥3.5 ms were identified as PSF produced by the afferent. The PSF parameters documented in this study were measured after subtracting the effects of synchrony facilitation. PSF of EMG activity began at a mean latency of 5.8 ± 0.3 (SE) ms and peaked at a mean latency of 7.5 ± 0.3 (SE) ms. In previous studies, the PSFs from CM and RM cells had mean onset latencies of 6.3 and 5.6 ms, respectively, and mean peak latencies of 10.2 and 9.1 ms. A measure of the PSF amplitude is the mean percent increase (MPI), defined as the increase of the PSF above its base measured as a percentage of the prespike baseline mean. Muscles facilitated by the 29 afferent units that produced PSF had an average MPI of 4.6 ± 0.3% (SE). This is smaller than the MPIs reported for RM (5.1%) and CM (7.0%) cells (which were not similarly corrected for possible synchrony facilitations). Units that facilitated EMG activity usually facilitated a subset of the coactivated muscles. The 29 adequately tested afferents facilitated an average of 46% of the synergistically coactivated muscles. This is comparable to the percentage of muscles facilitated by CM (40%) and RM (50%) cells. The average number of muscles facilitated per afferent was 2.6. The results reveal some salient differences between the discharge properties of DRG afferents and supraspinal premotoneuronal (PreM) cells in motor cortex and red nucleus. All three PreM populations include tonic, phasic-tonic, and phasic cells but in significantly different proportions. The PreM afferents were typically active only with their target muscles, like CM cells and unlike RM cells. The hypothesis that these PreM afferents arose from muscle spindles is supported by their short-latency PSF, their responses to perturbations, and their onset before activity of their target muscles; the early activation would further suggest that γ-motoneurons can activate spindles before α-motoneurons become active.","","animal experiment; animal tissue; arm muscle; article; electromyogram; electrostimulation; facilitation; latent period; male; monkey; motoneuron; motor cortex; muscle isometric contraction; nerve potential; nonhuman; peripheral nerve; priority journal; red nucleus; sensory nerve; spike wave; spinal ganglion; task performance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026689019"

To examine the activity of single units in the lateral striatum of the awake rat with respect to sensorimotor function, 788 units were recorded during locomotion and passive testing. The focus of this report is on 138 units (18%) that fired in relation to sensorimotor activity of a single limb. The remaining units were related to other body parts (16%), to general body movement (38%), or were unresponsive (28%). 2. Firing rates of limb-related units were near zero during resting behavior but increased markedly during treadmill locomotion. Each of the 138 units exhibited a rhythmic pattern of discharge in phase with the locomotor step cycle. Passive testing revealed that 86/97 units tested (89%) responded to passive manipulation of a single limb, exhibiting increased firing rates. Of these, 77 (90%) were related to contralateral and 9 (10%) to ipsilateral limbs. Sixty-one units (71%) were related to a forelimb and 25 (29%) to a hindlimb. Of the 86 units responding to passive manipulation, 34/48 units tested (71%) also responded to cutaneous stimulation of the same limb but not other part of the body. 3. To study in greater detail the rhythmic unit discharges in phase with the locomotor step cycle, computer-synchronized videotape recordings were used to generate perimovement time histograms constructed around discrete locomotor movements of each limb (n = 17 units). Activity of each unit was shown to be restricted to a specific portion of a particular limb's step cycle. The majority of units discharged throughout (8 units) or during a portion of (3 units) the swing phase, whereas other units fired during a portion of stance (3 units), footfall (2 units), or foot off (1 unit). 4. The specificity of unit firing was further demonstrated by the finding that rhythmic discharges, related to discrete locomotor limb movements in the forward direction, were completely absent during spontaneous deviations such as backward or disrupted locomotion. 5. Units related to limb movement were located in the far lateral, especially the dorsolateral, subregion of the striatum. This subregion extended rostrocaudally from A-P + 1.6 to -1.0 mm relative to bregma. No clear somatotopic organization was observed, but this issue requires further study. 6. These results show that functional representations of individual limbs can be demonstrated in the lateral striatum of the rat, within a subregion containing terminals of projections from somatic sensorimotor cortex. Taken together with the lack of this type of specificity previously shown for units in more medial striatal subregions, these findings support the idea of a functional differentiation between the medial and lateral striatum of the rat.","","animal experiment; article; controlled study; corpus striatum; electrophysiology; female; locomotion; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025155044"

The results showed that both the semivo-latile and particle-bound organics emitted from the kerosene heaters were mutagenic, and the presence of nitropolycyclic hydrocarbons in these organic emissions substan-tiated these findings. © 1988 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation.","","Air Pollutants; Atmosphere Exposure Chambers; Kerosene; Mutagenicity Tests; Mutagens; Salmonella typhimurium; Typhimurium; kerosene; organic compound; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; article; metabolic activation; mutagenicity; nonhuman; priority journal; salmonella typhimurium","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026694350"

Most units (n = 41) fired only during expiration and exhibited a steady, a decreasing or a late augmenting discharge pattern. These units were found only in vagal filaments. Twenty three units discharged during inspiration and exhibited a steady, a late augmenting or a tonic discharge pattern. The inspiratory-related units were present in both the vagus (n=13) and glossopharyngeal (n=10) nerves. Nineteen of 20 pharyngeal inspiratoryrelated units tested were activated at short latency (range 3.4 to 8.0 ms) by stimulation of afferents in the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN). In 13 of these, such stimulation also suppressed their spontaneous activity. SLN stimulation elicited in all 17 pharyngeal expiratory-related units tested a short latency (range 0 to 8 ms) reduction of activity, followed in 7 units by an increase in activity. SLN stimulation occasionally evoked single or rhythmic multifibre bursts in the vagal pharyngeal filaments. These bursts, involving expiratory-related units, likely correspond to the buccopharyngeal stage of swallowing. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Cat; Glossopharyngeal nerve; Respiratory-related units; Single fibre recordings; Superior laryngeal nerve; Vagal pharyngeal nerve","Action Potentials; Animal; Cats; Female; Glossopharyngeal Nerve; Laryngeal Nerves; Male; Motor Neurons; Muscles; Pharyngeal Muscles; Respiration; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Vagus Nerve; animal experiment; article; breathing pattern; cat; decerebration; glossopharyngeal nerve; laryngeal nerve; nonhuman; priority journal; vagus nerve","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024787822"

The effects of tape-recordad sounds (miaow, whistle, click, hiss), touch, light, smoke, reticular stimulation, and the presence of a white rat were tested on the unitary activity of the amygdala. Results were as follows: 1. 1. Most units of the amygdala showed spontaneous firing in the absence of experimental stimulation. 2. 2. In about half of the units tested the firing rate was modified undar the influence of sensory stimulation. 3. 3. Spontaneous sleep reduced the rate of spontaneous firing, dacreased the facilitatory and increased the inhibitory effects of sensory stimulation. 4. 4. Different sensory stimulations could show convergence of effects on the same unit. 5. 5. Each unit usually respondad with its own pattern (facilitation, inhibition, inhibition-facilitation) to different types of sensory stimulation. Reticular excitation would tend to enhance these responses. Also the attention of the animal seemed to play a role in unitary activity. 6. 6. Responses were more readily evoked by the ""miaow"" stimulus than by other types of sensory stimulation. 7. 7. The presence of a white rat in the cat's cage produced a rather prominent and lasting increase in the rate of unitary firing. 8. 8. Anatomically, the unitary responses were recordad from: (a) anterior, (b) lateral, and (c) medial part of the amygdaloid complex. The anterior area possessed fewer units responding to sensory stimulation than the other two. Facilitatory responses predominated in the lateral, and inhibitory responses in the medial area.

The influence of power‐setting, direction of file oscillation, interfacial force and operator‐assisted movement were studied. Filing was performed on flat surfaces of dentine and impressions of the instrumented surfaces revealed characteristic patterns of dentine removal corresponding to the area of contact with the file which was quantified using a Reflex microscope. Differences in dentine removal as affected by the power output of the two systems were only apparent when the maximum power‐setting on the Cavi‐Endo was compared with the maximum recommended for root canal preparation on the Piezon‐Endo. The Cavi‐Endo removed significantly more dentine than the Piezon‐Endo. When operator‐assisted movement of the file was superimposed, both systems removed significantly more dentine than without assisted filing. However, the Piezon‐Endo now removed significantly more dentine than the Cavi‐Endo. This difference was more apparent when the file oscillated perpendicular to the dentine surface, compared with oscillation parallel to the substrate. An increase in the interfacial force from 30 g to 60 g resulted in a greater reduction in dentine removal by the Cavi‐Endo compared with the Piezon‐Endo. Thus, at a 30 g interfacial force there were insignificant differences between the endosonic units but at 60 g, the Piezon‐Endo removed significantly more dentine than the Cavi‐Endo. The dentine‐removing characteristics of the two endosonic units tested are very different under certain conditions. These findings may have important clinical implications.

Evidence is presented that motor unit spike trains may be modelled by a renewal process with an underlying gaussian probability density. Statistical independence of successive interspike intervals is shown using scatter diagrams; the hypothesis of a gaussian distribution is accepted at the 99th percentile confidence limit, chi-square test, in 90% of the units tested. A functional relationship between the mean and standard deviation is shown and discussed; its implications in obtaining sample size are presented in an appendix.

The activity of each unit was studied in two behavioral conditions: a) During task performance, the monkey had to compare two tones separated by one second of silence (inter-stimulus interval), b) During a nonperforming period; the monkey heard the two tones but did not respond behaviorally. It was noted that the firing rate of many units during the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was dependent on the frequency of the first tone. Such dependency was observed even towards the end of the ISI, both during task performance trials (50% of the units) and during the nonperforming period (32% of the units). The activity of these units could be the basis of STMT in both of these behavioral states. In 65% of all the units tested, the responses during the ISI were of a higher magnitude in the performance period than were the responses in the non-performance period. The activity of these units may be related either to general processes such as attention and expectation or to short-term memory processes. During task performance, the responses of 23% of the units to the second tone were dependent on whether its frequency was identical to that of the first tone. Such dependency was never observed during the non-performing period. These units may detect similarity or non similarity between two tones presented one second apart. Periodic patterns of firing were not found in the study, thus suggesting that the ISI responses were not generated by reverberatory activity in simple closed loops. On the basis of these results, several alternative mechanisms of STMT are suggested. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Auditory cortex; Behaving monkeys; Short term memory; Single unit recording","Acoustic Stimulation; Animal; Auditory Cortex; Auditory Pathways; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Papio; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; animal experiment; auditory cortex; male; monkey; nonhuman; priority journal; short term memory; single unit activity; sound","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024558547"

Discharges in response to the CS or DS were found in 57% of 138 units tested. Forty-one percent of units responding to the CS did so at latencies of <40 msec. After conditioning a discriminative CR to click CS, an increase in the ratio of CS-evoked activity to baseline activity was found relative to that before conditioning. This increase was attributable, in part, to a decrease in baseline activity and, in part, to an increase in the magnitude of response to the CS. These responses preceded early components of the electromyographically measured motor responses with latencies sufficient to contribute to initiation of the movement. After acquisition of the CR, the proportion of CS responsive units also increased. We conclude that this area of the thalamus, a region thought to support thalamocortical reverberatory activity, also functions to transmit short-latency auditory signals. Our evidence further suggests that this region may participate in the elicitation of conditioned responses by specific auditory stimuli and in discrimination between auditory stimuli of different significance.","","animal experiment; animal tissue; article; auditory stimulation; cat; conditioning; controlled study; histochemistry; nonhuman; priority journal; single unit activity; thalamus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026012224"

For this purpose, the response characteristics of 69 vestibular nuclei units to sinusoidal otolith stimulation in the vertical Z axis were analysed in the alert cat. Among this population of neurons which responded to a 0.05 Hz, 290 mm translation, 47 units (70%) displayed a firing rate modulation which followed the input frequency (H1 units). The majority of these neurons exhibited an increase in discharge rate during upward displacement, with a response phase close to the motion velocity or slightly leading downward acceleration. The acceleration related units were divided into two groups according to whether they showed clear increases or only a slight change in discharge rate when the stimulus frequency was increased. The former group was characterized by an average -16.3 dB drop in gain (from 43.9±1.8 dB, S.D. to 27.6±7 dB, S.D.) within the 0.05 Hz-0.5 Hz frequency range, while the latter group displayed an average -31.2 dB gain attenuation (from 45.1±1.1 dB, S.D. to 13.9±0 dB) within the same decade. In contrast to differences in response gain, all the units tested exhibited a relatively stable phase lead of about 20° with respect to downward peak acceleration. Conversely, units whose response was close to motion velocity in the lower frequency range (0.05 Hz-0.10 Hz) displayed a strong phase lead of about 100° when the stimulus frequency was increased (up to 0.50 Hz). These neurons were thus characterized by an acceleration related response in the higher frequency range. At the same time, an average -24.8 dB gain attenuation (from 47.7±3.4 dB to 22.9±3.7 dB) was found in the 0.05 Hz-0.5 Hz decade. The remaining 22 neurons (30%) were called H2 units since they displayed a response waveform double that of the input frequency, a response already described during sinusoidal rotation. Unit discharge reached a peak approximately in phase with maximum upward and downward velocity. Asymmetrical change in unit firing rate about the resting discharge level and different dynamic behavior of the upward and downward response components were usually found. These response characteristics suggest that the H2 patterns are centrally constructed and could result from convergence of otolith afferents having opposite polarization vectors. Other evidence suggests that these units which behave like motion-detectors can exert an influence on the neck musculature. Our results corroborate, at least in part, the findings of previous studies on the dynamic responses properties of otolith-dependent central neurons during roll tilt, or pure linear acceleration in the horizontal plane. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Alert cat; Otolith system; Unit activity; Vertical linear acceleration; Vestibular nuclei","Animals; Cats; Consciousness; Motion; Motion Perception; Neurons; Otolithic Membrane; Physical Stimulation; Saccule and Utricle; Vestibular Nuclei; animal experiment; auditory system; cat; central nervous system; linear acceleration; nonhuman; otolith; priority journal; vestibular nucleus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023099931"

Mutation analysis is used to assess the test set efficiency with respect to error detection. The experimental results involve a total of 2914 mutants. They show that structural statistical testing, which exhibits the highest mutation scores, leaving alive only six from 2816 nonequivalent mutants within short testing times, is the most efficient.

Of the 53 units tested during sinusoidal motion at 0.05 Hz (9.1 cm/ s), 1 (1.9%) was responsive to the otolith input only, 13 (24.5%) were influenced by the visual input only and 23 (43.4%) responded to both modalities. Neurons were excited either during upward or downward animal or visual surround movement. Most units displayed a firing rate modulation very close to motion velocity. All the neurons receiving convergent visual and otolith inputs (0.05 Hz, 9.1 cm/s) exhibited synergistic patterns of response. Motion velocity coding was improved in terms of inputoutput phase relationship and response sensitivity when visual and otolith signals were combined. Depending on the units, visual-otolith interactions in single neurons could follow a linear or a nonlinear mode of summation. The dynamic characteristics of visual-otolith interactions were examined in the 0.05 Hz-0.50 Hz frequency bandwidth. Visual signals seemed to predominate over otolith signals at low stimulus frequencies (up to 0.25 Hz), while the contrary was found in the higher frequency range of movement (above 0.25 Hz). The effects of visual stabilization (VS: suppression of visual motion cues) was observed in a small sample of units. As a rule, VS induced a reduction in the amplitude of unit response as compared to visual + otolith stimulation, the lower the motion frequency, the more pronounced the attenuation. VS also decreased the amplitude of the otolith-dependent component of response. The possible modes of visual-vestibular interactions in single cells are discussed.

The drugs were added to the incubating medium or ejected by pressure from a micropipette. After NE superfusion firing rate increased in 52% of the reactive units, while activity of 48% was suppressed. The direction of the effect strongly correlated with pattern of spontaneous activity: only the cells with 'complex discharges' (short bursts of 2-4 spikes with attenuation of amplitude) were suppressed by NE; the cells with single spikes increased the level activity. Similar excitatory effects of NE were observed in all units (n = 14) with single spike activity recorded in the field CA1. 5-HT increased activity in 30% of the reactive units and suppressed it in 70% of them. Some of the cells which were suppressed by 5-HT, were excited by NE. In more than a half of the units tested, 5-HT led to prolonged (up to 30-40 min) increase of the level of background activity irrespective of the initial excitatory or suppressive action; periodic grouped discharges appeared in some units under the influence of 5-HT. The response to mfs usually changed in the same direction as the level of background activity during application of NE and 5-HT, though some exceptions were observed in both cases.

A redundancy test carried out by laser trimming (LT) consists of a pre-LT test for detecting the failed addresses and laser trimming for repairing the failed bits. Increased testing time is generally caused by an increase of the pre-LT testing time, because the repair time is almost always constant, regardless of the memory bit density. To shorten the pre-LT test time, a 'fast test' such as a diagonal checker pattern is introduced in the first step of the testing process using a redundancy flag option. Six to 10 times greater throughput has been achieved.","","DATA STORAGE UNITS - Testing; REDUNDANCY; DIAGONAL CHECKER PATTERN; FAILED BITS REPAIR; MULTIBIT-TEST (MBT) MODE; PRE-LASER TRIMMING (LT) TESTING TIME; REDUNDANCY FLAG OPTION; DATA STORAGE, DIGITAL","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0022915509"

Field potentials were recorded within the boundaries of the septal component of the diagonal band of Broca following stimulation of the fornix. The position of the recording electrode was marked by pressure injection of Alcian blue dye. 2. Stimulation of the medial aspect of the ipsilateral fornix produced a simple field caudally consisting of a short duration, short latency negative wave (N1) and a later small prolonged positive wave (P1). It is suggested that N1 is due to antidromic activation of the cells and P1 to their recurrent inhibition. 3. In the rostral part of the septal component of the diagonal band of Broca the field pattern was more complex, containing, in addition to N1 and P1, further negative waves, N2 and N3. N2 was compounded of antidromically and synaptically evoked components and N3 was associated with monosynaptic excitation of the cells. 4. Stimulation of the lateral margin of the fornix was shown to excite antidromically and synaptically the same cells as were excited by stimulation of the medial aspect of the fornix. 5. Stimulation of the medial and lateral aspects of contralateral fornix generated positive waves of similar character to P1. 6. Intracarotid injection of hyperosmotic saline solution caused behavioural signs of arousal and inhibition of spontaneous discharge in a third of the units tested. Spontaneously discharging units (mean frequency +/‐ S.E. of mean, 13.4 +/‐ 1.8, n = 55) were inhibited by stimulation of the medial and lateral ipsilateral and contralateral fornix. It is suggested that inhibitory interneurones receive contra‐ and ipsilateral input. Units with these characteristics were found. 7. The septal component of the diagonal band of Broca was compared with other septal nuclei and found to resemble them in its rostral portion in that it has a reciprocal relationship with ventral and dorsal hippocampus.

The receptive fields of the recorded units were analyzed and the units tested for inputs from the medial lemniscus (ML) and spinothalamic tract (STT) by electrical stimulation of the dorsal columns (DC) and ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) at the C2-3 spinal level. Thirty-eight STT fibers were isolated in the thalamus. Their conduction velocities ranged from 15 to 75 m/s (mode 36 m/s). Adequate stimuli were found for 23 of these fibers. Seventeen were low-threshold (LT), 3 were wide-dynamic-range (WDR), and 3 were high-threshold (HT) units. Five STT fibers were intra-axonally injected. Three were sufficiently well filled for analysis of their terminal fields. An intermediate-velocity STT fiber (conduction velocity 38 m/s) had a 4.3-μm axon and a single large terminal field in the central lateral nucleus (CL). The other two STT fibers were smaller, with diameters of 2.5 and 2.3 μm, conduction velocities of 15 and 19 m/s, and terminal fields made up of a few small boutons at the borders of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL). Of 319 neurons isolated, 14 out of 129 (10.8%) in VL, 14 out of 76 (18.4%) in the VPL or ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus, 27 out of 64 (42.2%) in the CL nucleus, and 5 out of 50 (10%) in the reticular nucleus (R) responded at latencies <50 ms to VLF stimuli. A train of three pulses was more effective in driving VLF-responding neurons in all these nuclei than a single pulse. VLF-responding cells were widely dispersed in VL, concentrated in a focus in CL, and distributed around the borders of VPL. Most of those in VL and a small number in CL could be antidromically activated by stimulation of motor cortex. Latencies of presynaptic responses (STT fibers) to VLF stimulation were short and varied from 0.8 to 3.9 ms (mode 1.6 ms). Despite this, very few fast-responding neurons were found. These were six VPL neurons (2.5 to 4 ms), one VL neuron (3 ms), and four CL neurons (3-4 ms). The initial spike latencies of the majority of thalamic neurons responding to VLF stimulation appeared in two peaks, one between 6 and 8 ms and the other at 10-15 ms. By contrast, responses of ML fibers to DC stimulation, even with a synaptic delay in the DC or lateral cervical nuclei, peaked at 2-4 ms, and many VPL neurons responded to DC stimulation with an initial spike latency <4 ms. Few or no neurons in the other nuclei had latencies ≤4 ms. The latencies of the small number of VL neurons responding to DC stimulation were ≥6 ms, implying polysynaptic activation. The shortest latencies of response of VL neurons to VLF stimulation included three recorded intracellularly, all showing initial excitatory postsynaptic potential latencies at 3 ms but initial spike latencies of 3, 7, and 9 ms. On the basis of the anatomic and electrophysiological data, therefore, it is likely that monosynaptic STT inputs to the individual thalamic cells studied are sparse and of low efficacy. Temporal summation is needed for activation in anesthetized animals. Even when activated, thalamic neurons show wide fluctuation in their spike latencies. Most of the isolated VL neurons responding to VLF stimulation could not be activated by natural stimuli. For the few neurons in which a receptive field was found, the adequate stimulus was usually slow and heavy tapping of the receptive field or occasionally intense pressure. These patterns of responsiveness were similar for CL neurons. A wider range of adequate stimuli was found for VPL neurons. Low-threshold units were found in the core of the VPL. Some of these units were inhibited by VLF stimuli. Excitatory VLF-responsive units were located at the borders of VPL. These neurons were either LT, WDR, or HT units. Some scattered R neurons also responded to these types of stimuli. Of the neurons responding to VLF stimulation at latencies <50 ms, 4/16 (25%) of the VL neurons, 9/57 (16%) of the VPL neurons, and 22/36 (61%) of the CL neurons showed convergent excitatory inputs from VLF and DC stimulation. A small number of R neurons (4/19, or 21%) also showed convergent inputs. The results show fundamental similarities between STT recipient neurons in the VL and CL and at the borders of the VPL nuclei. They confirm the general lack of direct DC inputs to VL neurons and suggest that STT inputs to VL neurons are unlikely to form a basis for the fast relay of light tactile and proprioceptive information to the motor cortex.","","animal experiment; article; controlled study; electrophysiology; female; male; motor cortex; nonhuman; priority journal; spinothalamic tract","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025948983"

Experimental results demonstrate the validity of “simple SOS device predictions of failure levels for the more complex ALU devices. ALU samples were fabricated with four types of insulators; namely: Al2O3, ion-implanted SiO2, dry SiO2, and wet SiO2 These devices were specially made to investigate total dose hardness and to check the transient hardness of the fabrication on a sapphire substrate. Circuit design and sizing rules to achieve transient hardness were not utilized. Devices were exposed to 10-MeV electron pulses of 20 and 100 ns in a static and an active mode, with inputs activated by six basic test patterns. Upset failure did not occur in the 20-ns pulse tests for all exposure conditions and dose rates up to and including the maximum rate of 1.3 x 1010 rads (Si)/s. The 100-ns pulse tests indicate that the failure level is 3.5 x 1010 rads (si)/s, whereas the pass level is rads (Si)/s. The worst-case exposure conditions are the static mode of operation with the chip outputs in a high state. In order to explain the test results, a simple circuit model of a limited part of the chip output circuit was derived for the static mode of operation and output high. Using the RCA Circuit Analysis Program (R-CAP), the circuit was simulated using pulse and linear current sources for 100-ns pulse duration. Simulation results indicate that failure occurs when the photocurrents are 65 and for the two types of sources, respectively. These correspond to normalized conductances of mhos/mil-rad/s and mhos/mil-rad/s. Using the ALU test results and the ALU computer simulation for the transient radiation response, a Complementary Metal-Oxide semiconductor Silicon-On-Sapphire (CMOS/ SOS), 1024-Bit Read Only Memory currently under development by RCA was analyzed to determine its transient hardness level. The analysis, using RCA computer simulations, suggested several design rules involving both logic design and device size which will increase the upset failure levels by factors of 2 to 15, but at the expense of speed and chip area. Using the ALU experimental values of photocurrent and dose rate, the failure level of the present ROM design was determined from simulation analyses to berad (Si)/s for a 100-ns pulse.

Receptive fields on the glans penis were stimulated with a computer-controlled mechanostimulator and Peltier effect thermostimulator. The great majority of units were categorized as either rapidly adapting (RA) or slowly adapting (SA) and were located primarily proximally and distally, respectively, on the glans. In comparison to values from other glabrous skin regions in other species, mean displacement and force thresholds of penile mechanoreceptors were high, whereas the mean velocity thresholds were low. SA units, generally poor encoders of static displacement, were distinguishable into two types based on static response firing pattern but were not homologous to either the SA I or SA II mechanoreceptors found in other skin regions. Fifty-five units were given simultaneous mechanical and thermal stimulation. Very few units responded to pure thermal stimulation or increased their discharge frequency to skin cooling. Warm receptive-field temperatures between 35 and 43°C increased mechanical sensitivity, measured by displacement and velocity coding functions, in almost all units tested. We conclude that canine penile mechanoreceptors, capable of encoding a variety of skin movements when the penis is warm, provide the spinal cord with the sensory input necessary to drive the spinal sexual reflexes. However, many appear to be at least physiologically different from mechanoreceptors native to other skin areas.","","animal experiment; dog; male genital system; mechanical stimulation; mechanoreceptor; nerve fiber membrane potential; nervous system; nonhuman; penis glans; peripheral nervous system; priority journal; receptive field; sensory stimulation; thermal stimulation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023215391"

The dorsal tegmental nucleus consists of the pars ventralis (TDV) and the pars dorsalis (TDD). The normal neuropil of the dorsal tegmental nucleus contains three classes of axodendritic terminals, that is, terminals containing round, flat, and pleomorphic vesicles. They make up 44%, 5%, and 51%, respectively, of all axodendritic terminals in the TDV, and 62%, 1%, and 37% in the TDD. Injection of WGA‐HRP into the lateral mammillary nucleus permits ultrastructural recognition of many anterograde labeled terminals within both the TDV and TDD. In the TDV, 81% of the labeled terminals contain round synaptic vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts. A few of the labeled terminals contain pleomorphic vesicles and make symmetric synaptic contacts. More than 50% of the labeled terminals contact intermediate dendrites (1–2 μm diameter). In the TDD, almost all labeled terminals are small, contain round vesicles, and make asymmetric synaptic contacts. These terminals mainly contact intermediate as well as distal (less than 1 μm diameter) dendrites. There are only a few labeled terminals with pleomorphic vesicles and no terminals with flat vesicles. The termination pattern of the lateral mammillary neurons in the TDV is similar to that in the TDD. Anterograde labeled axon terminals often contact retrograde labeled dendrites in the TDV. No reciprocal connections are present in the TDD. These results suggest that the TDV and the TDD receive mainly excitatory and a few inhibitory inputs from the lateral mammillary nucleus. The TDV neurons also have direct reciprocal connections with the lateral mammillary neurons.

Recordings were made from single nerve fibers in barbiturate-anesthetized cats in the midline trapezoid body, a location that permits selective sampling of efferent cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus. Single units were localized to either the dorsal or ventral components of the trapezoid body. The fibers were physiologically classified on the basis of their peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) and receptive-field properties. In addition, low characteristic frequency (CF) units were probed for rapid rate and phase shifts with increases in intensity. The projection patterns of some fibers were traced by iontophoresing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into their axons. 2. HRP-labeled fibers most likely originated from globular bushy cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus in that they sent a large branch into the contralateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body which terminated in a calyceal ending and an ipsilateral branch into the lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body. A thin branch, usually starting from the large branch, wound its way through the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body to its termination in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body. Additional branches from the parent axon could pass through medial periolivary groups throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the superior olivary complex. The parent fiber was traced as far as the ventral lateral lemniscus where it faded before reaching its termination. 3. The majority of units were recorded in the ventral component of the trapezoid body. Although the ventral component is comprised of both large and small diameter fibers, our sample was biased to the larger diameter fibers representing the activity of axons originating from globular bushy cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus. Ventral component units were not tonotopically arrayed and had CFs that spanned the audible range for cats. HRP labeling of ventral component axons revealed that the section of the axon traveling through the midline shifted its dorsal-ventral location. This pattern was compatible with the lack of tonotopy found in the ventral component. Recordings were also made from the dorsal component of the trapezoid body, which contained medium diameter axons. These axons originated from spherical bushy cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus. Dorsal component units were tonotopically arrayed and had CFs <7 kHz. 4. Cells were characterized by their PSTH at CF. Primary-like and phase-locked units constituted most of the dorsal component units. Primary-notch, onset-L, and chopper units were found almost exclusively in the domain of the ventral component. Primary-notch and onset-L units shared the shortest first-spike latency of any PSTH group, had the smallest standard deviation of first-spike latencies, and appeared to be a continuum of the same PSTH category, differing only in sustained rate. Chopper units also had precise first-spike latencies, but their mean latencies tended to be longer than primary-notch and onset-L units. Chopper units constituted only 11% of the recordings from the ventral component and were recorded from the ventral border of the ventral component. A first-order interval analysis indicated that chopper units could be subcategorized in the same way as units recorded directly from the cochlear nucleus. Chopper units probably represent the activity of stellate cells in the cochlear nucleus, indicating that these cells may be sampled from a restricted region of the trapezoid body. 5. The receptive fields of 22 ventral component neurons were mapped by the use of pure tones and correlated with PSTH responses. Inhibitory sidebands were found in 18 of these fibers. Sideband inhibition was associated with primary-like, primary-notch, and the only chopper unit tested. None of the five dorsal component units for which receptive fields were obtained had inhibitory sidebands. 6. The spontaneous and driven rate distributions for dorsal and ventral component units were very different from those of the auditory nerve. The majority of low CF units (<6 kHz) of the ventral component had spontaneous rates <10 spikes/s; high CF units of the ventral component had a wide range of spontaneous rates, up to 110 spikes/s. Dorsal component units rarely displayed spontaneous rates <10 spikes/s. Maximum driven rates of primary-like, chopper, and primary-notch units could be very high, on the order of 500-600 spikes/s. Driven rates >450 spikes/s came only from units with CFs >8 kHz.","","animal experiment; article; auditory stimulation; cat; cochlea ventral nucleus; histology; mammal; nonhuman; priority journal; trapezoid body","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025277771"

However, these effects become more predictable as nucleus accumbens septi neurons are functionally categorized by their responses to afferent stimulation. In the present study, the effects of systemic opiates on individual nucleus accumbens septi neurons categorized by their response patterns to ventral pallidum stimulation were examined. Across all nucleus accumbens septi units tested, these experiments showed that morphine either inhibited (42%, n = 91), excited (15%, n = 32) or had no effect (43%, n = 93) on these unit responses. Further experiments were conducted in which nucleus accumbens septi neurons were categorized on the basis of their response patterns to concurrent fimbria and ventral pallidum stimulation. In these studies, if the neuron was orthodromically evoked to respond by both fimbria stimulation and ventral pallidum stimulation, the neurons' responses to ventral pallidum stimulation (but not their fimbria-evoked responses) were consistently inhibited by morphine. In contrast, nucleus accumbens septi unit responses that were orthodromically activated by ventral pallidum stimulation but unaffected by fimbria stimulation were consistently unaffected by morphine. The major observation of this work is that the effect of systemically administered morphine on individual nucleus accumbens septi neurons can be predicted by that neuron's evoked responses to stimulation of different efferent and afferent circuits. Since these studies involve systemic administration of morphine, the results do not elucidate site of action. However, these results do contribute to the understanding of net opiate effects at a systems level and therefore are relevant to the consequences of such drugs in self-administration paradigms. © 1994.","","Animal; Electric Stimulation; Electrophysiology; Globus Pallidus; Male; Morphine; Naloxone; Neurons; Neurons, Afferent; Neurons, Efferent; Nucleus Accumbens; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; morphine; naloxone; animal experiment; article; controlled study; globus pallidus; male; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; priority journal; rat; single unit activity; subcutaneous drug administration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0028051784"

Occasionally stimuli delivered to the spinal cord caused lengthening of interspike intervals in respiratory modulated neurons and in other bulbar units, the discharge of which was not modulated with respiration. Vagal stimuli often entailed lengthening of the following interspike interval, while the interval during which stimuli were applied remained unaltered; latencies suggested that inhibitory pathways were polysynaptic. In expiratory-inspiratory (EI) and inspiratory (I) neurons, lengthenings of intervals roughly doubled those noted in inspiratory-expiratory (IE) and expiratory (E) units. Lengthening of intervals depended on the stimulus incidence within the intervals and was greatest when the stimuli were delivered during the late part of the intervals.

Finally, both neck and macular inputs were elicited by rotating the head, while the body remained fixed in the horizontal position. Among the 102 lateral reticular units tested at the frequency of rotation of 0.026 Hz (5-10° peak amplitude), 51 units (i.e., 50%) responded to both neck and macular inputs, 10 units (9.8%) responded to the neck inputs only, 7 units (6.9%) to the macular input only, while the remaining 34 units (33.3%) were unresponsive to either type of stimulation. The first harmonic of responses to the neck input and the macular input showed an average phase lead of about +38° with respect to neck position and +14° with respect to animal position. The sensitivity of the units, expressed in percentage changes of the mean firing rate per degree of displacement, corresponded on the average to 5.5 ± 5.1 (SD) for the neck responses and 3.2 ± 2.8 (SD) for the macular responses. Two distinct populations of neurons were observed. The first group of units (36/48, i.e., 75%) received reciprocal influences from neck and macular receptors. These units were mainly excited during side-down neck rotation, but were inhibited during side-down tilt of the whole animal. The sensitivity of the neck responses was only slightly higher than that of the macular responses. In contrast, the second group of units (12/48, i.e., 25%) received parallel influences from the two types of receptors. These units were mainly excited during both side-up neck rotation and side-up tilt of the whole animal. The sensitivity of the neck responses within this group was much higher than that of the macular responses. The first population of units received a somatosensory input from the hindlimbs, which was not the case for the other one. Moreover, the first group of units was distributed within the whole extent of the NRL, while the second group was concentrated in the dorsomedial, magnocellular part of this nucleus. The response characteristics of lateral reticular neurons to the combined neck and macular inputs, elicited during head rotation, closely corresponded to those obtained under the assumption of a vectorial summation of the individual neck and macular responses. In particular, the units that showed a reciprocal pattern of convergence displayed small amplitudes and large phase leads of the responses with respect to head position, when both types of receptors were simultaneously stimulated. In contrast, the units that showed a parallel pattern of convergence displayed large amplitude and small phase leads during head rotation. The functional significance of these two populations of neurons is discussed in relation to the known tonic effects of neck and macular vestibular inputs on the limb, neck, and extrinsic eye musculature.","","animal experiment; cat; central nervous system; decerebration; lateral reticular nucleus; neck muscle; nerve cell membrane potential; nervous system; vestibular system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0019404455"

However, the areas of the central nervous system that mediate this reflex remain elusive. A recent study from this laboratory suggested that neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) participate in the pressor reflex to muscular contraction. In the present study, we sought to ascertain whether extracellular single-unit activity of VLM neurons is altered by static contraction of hindlimb muscles. In anesthetized cats, muscular contraction elicited by stimulation of L7 and S1 ventral roots evoked increases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and minute ventilation. The firing frequency in 33 of 50 VLM units increased > 70% during muscular contraction. VLM units displayed two types of discharge patterns in response to contraction: 1) a rapid onset response (0.5-3 s) and 2) a delayed onset response (10-20 s). Computer averaging analysis showed that 14 of 28 VLM units tested had a cardiac-related rhythm and 10 of those 14 also responded to muscular contraction. Muscular contraction had no effect on the discharge patterns of most neurons located outside the VLM. These findings suggest that neurons in the ventrolateral medulla respond to muscular contraction and may have a role in the pressor reflex to muscular contraction.","cat; exercise; pressor reflex; single-unit activity; ventrolateral medulla","animal experiment; article; brain; cat; controlled study; electrophysiology; exercise; muscle contraction; nonhuman; pressoreceptor reflex; priority journal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025046513"

Altogether, 204 units were studied from estrogen-treated and untreated preparations, and at the resting state, 37% of these units fired regularly, 57% fired irregularly, and 6% were silent but evokable by electrical stimulation. Most of the irregular units fired continuously (n=100), while the rest fired intermittently (n=12) or phasically (n=4). Neurons with different types of firing patterns also varied significantly in resting firing rate and in responsiveness to transmitters and to estrogen treatment. The average resting firing rate decreased significantly from regular, irregular and continuous, intermittent, to silent units. Acetylcholine (ACh) and/or serotonin (5-HT) injected directly into the perfusion chamber evoked responses from more irregular (69% of 61 units) than regular units (20% of 46 units). None of the 5 silent units tested was activated by ACh or 5-HT. Responses to ACh (predominantly inhibitory) and 5-HT (predominantly excitatory) seen here in vitro were opposite to those observed in vivo with iontophoretic application, and were not reversed or abolished by the blockade of synaptic transmission. Comparisons of data between the two types of preparations showed that only the responsiveness of the irregular units to ACh and to 5-HT were significantly different: both types of responsiveness were higher in estrogen-treated than in untreated preparations. No significant difference was found in the responsiveness of regular units, or in firing patterns or firing rate. Thus, the present in vitro studies have demonstrated that SCN contains a heterogeneous population of neurons distinguishable by their electrophysiological and neuropharmacological characteristics, and that estrogen has a specific action on specic types of SCN neurons. © 1984.","acetylcholine; estrogen; serotonin; suprachiasmatic nucleus; synaptic transmission blockade; tissue slice","Acetylcholine; Animal; Atropine; Castration; Circadian Rhythm; Electric Stimulation; Estradiol; Evoked Potentials; Female; Hippocampus; Neural Inhibition; Neurons; Rats; Serotonin; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Suprachiasmatic Nucleus; Synaptic Transmission; Tissue Culture; acetylcholine; estradiol; estrogen; serotonin; animal cell; brain slice; central nervous system; drug efficacy; endocrine system; female genital system; nerve cell membrane potential; nervous system; nonhuman; ovariectomy; rat; supraoptic nucleus","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0021272452"

The experiments were performed on 43 cats anaesthetized with α-chloralose. The alterations in fusimotor activity were assessed from changes in the responses of the muscle spindle afferents to sinusoidal stretching of their parent muscles (triceps surae and plantaris). The mean rate of firing and the modulation of the afferent response were determined. Control measurements were made in absence of any cutaneous stimulation. Tests were made (a) during physiological stimulation of skin afferents of the ipsilateral pad or of the contralateral hindlimb, or (b) during repetitive electrical stimulation of the sural nerve in the ipsilateral hindlimb, or of sural or superficial peroneal nerve in the contralateral hindlimb. Of the total number of 113 units tested with repetitive electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral sural nerve (at 20 Hz), 24.8% exhibited predominantly dynamic fusimotor reflexes, 5.3% mixed or predominantly static fusimotor reflexes. One unit studied in a preparation with intact spinal cord exhibited static reflexes at low stimulation intensities and dynamic ones at higher stimulation strengths. The remaining units (69%) were uninfluenced. When the receptor-bearing muscle was held at constant length and a train of stimuli (at 20 Hz) was applied to the ipsilateral sural nerve, the action potentials in the primary muscle spindle afferent could be stimulus-locked to the 3rd or 4th pulse in the train (and to the pulses following thereafter), with a latency of about 24 ms from the effective pulse. This 1 : 1 pattern of driving seemed to be mediated via static and/or dynamic fusimotor neurons. Natural stimulation influenced comparatively few units (3 of 65 units tested from the ipsilateral pad and 10 of 98 tested from the contralateral hindlimb), but when the effects were present they were quite large. The results are discussed in relation to previous studies on reflex control of fusimotor neurones from cutaneous afferents. It is suggested that the wide range of fusimotor effects from cutaneous afferent fibres observed in this study (from complete absence of any effect, via moderate excitatory and inhibitory effects, to the 'driving pattern', i.e. pulse-to-pulse response) may reflect that different γ-motoneurones have individualized reflex profiles10,33,34,36, and it may also indicate that groups of fusimotor neurones and spindle afferents play specific roles in different motor acts 39. © 1989.","Cutaneous afferents; Fusimotor neurones; Motor control; Muscle spindles; Reflexes; Spinal cord","Action Potentials; Animal; Cats; Electric Stimulation; Hindlimb; Laterality; Motor Neurons; Muscles; Neurons, Afferent; Peripheral Nerves; Physical Stimulation; Reflex, Stretch; Skin; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; animal experiment; cat; electrophysiology; electrostimulation; gamma nerve fiber; motor control; muscle spindle; nonhuman; reflex; skin nerve; spinal cord","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0024415452"

Using standard extracellular techniques, we recorded from 81 single-unit and multi-unit clusters in the nBOR of the northern saw-whct owl, Aegolius acadicus, an avian species that has a visual system with frontal emphasis. These cells responded best to large patterns of random dots moving either upward (52%). downward (31%) or nasal to temporal (N-T; contralateral visual field; 15%). Only 2 units (2%) preferred temporal to nasal motion. ‘Up’ units were found in the dorsal portion of the nucleus whereas ‘Down’ units were located more ventrally. The N-T units were found in both the lateral margin of the nucleus and ventral to the Down units in the lateral half of the nucleus. About half of the units tested (10/19) responded to stimulation of the ipsilateral as well as the contralateral eye. For all but one cell, the direction preference of both eyes was the same in visual space. When compared with previous studies of pigeons (Columha livia) and chickens (Gallus domesticus), these findings reveal that the nBOR in all three avian species have important similarities with respect to direction preference and functional compartmentalization. Furthermore, the high proportion of binocular neurons found in the nBOR of the saw-whet owl is similar to the condition generally reported in frontal eyed mammals and hence may reflect adaptation. © 1994 S.

Discharges in response to the CS or DS were found in over 40% of units tested in each area, with onset latencies as short as 28-32 msec in mid-thalamus and 14 msec in posterolateral thalamus. The results provide evidence that both mid- and posterolateral thalamic regions of cats contain sufficient numbers of auditory responsive neurons to be considered part of the auditory system functionally. Patterns of activity changed after conditioning discriminative responses to the click CS. In mid-thalamus, the ratio of CS-evoked activity to baseline activity increased relative to levels found before conditioning. This increase was attributable to an increase in the magnitude of response to the CS. In posterolateral thalamus, an increase in the signal: noise ratio of activity in response to the CS was also found after conditioning, but this increase depended in large part on a decrease in the rate of baseline firing. Posterolateral thalamic units had substantially higher mean rates of baseline firing than mid-thalamic units before any conditioning sessions were begun. In all, different rates of baseline activity, means of enhancing activity in response to the click CS, and onsets of response were found at these two adjacent thalamic regions in which the unit response to the CS became greater than that to the DS after conditioning. We conclude that each region makes a separate contribution to information processing needed to discriminate effectively between auditory stimuli of different functional significance.","","animal experiment; animal tissue; article; auditory stimulation; cat; controlled study; electrophysiology; nonhuman; priority journal; single unit activity; thalamus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025786505"

The spike rates to the masker and signal + masker were compared to quantify masking at different interaural time delays of the noise. The signal was a 50-ms tone burst at best frequency or a 50-ms segment of a synthetic vowel, presented at the best interaural delay of the unit tested. At each noise masker delay, the noise level was adjusted to obtain a criterion spike difference. In most cases, the level required was lowest at the best delay for the noise. The mean difference between maximum and minimum masked thresholds across the cell population was very similar to the human psychophysical masking level difference under the same signal and masker conditions. In another series of tests, we measured the effect of the noise masker on the temporal pattern of the discharge to the signal. The signal used was a 500-ms segment of the synthetic vowel. In virtually all cases the addition of a continuous noise masker reduced the discharge rate synchronized to the fundamental frequency of the vowel. The degree of this reduction was dependent on the interaural time delay of the noise masker. For most units, maximum reduction was seen when the vowel and noise had the same interaural time delay. The similarity between the masking which we have shown physiologically and that reported in a variety of human psychophysical experiments suggests that the processing at levels up to and including the inferior colliculus contributes to the psychophysical BMLD. © 1991.","Binaural masking; Guinea-pig; Inferior colliculus; Interaural delays; Single cell recording","Acoustic Stimulation; Animal; Auditory Perception; Auditory Threshold; Comparative Study; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Guinea Pigs; Human; Inferior Colliculus; Sound Localization; Species Specificity; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; animal experiment; article; auditory nervous system; controlled study; electrophysiology; guinea pig; inferior colliculus; noise; nonhuman; priority journal","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025999357"

In decerebrate cats with the cerebellum intact we recorded the activity of lateral vestibulospinal neurons projecting to lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord (lVS neurons) and related the resting discharge, as well as the response characteristics of these neurons to roll tilt of the animal and neck rotation, with the cell size inferred from the conduction velocity of the corresponding axons. 2. A slight negative correlation was found between resting discharge rate and conduction velocity of the whole population of lVS neurons responsive and unresponsive to animal tilt and neck rotation, so that the faster the conduction velocity, the lower was the unit discharge at rest. This correlation, however, was found only for the dorsocaudal LVN neurons, which contributed to the majority of lVS units, but not for the rostroventral LVN neurons. Moreover, it affected the units unresponsive but not those responsive to vestibular stimulation; the opposite, however, occurred for the units tested to neck stimulation. These findings indicate that the static properties of the lVS neurons can only in part be related to cell size. 3. If we consider the lVS neurons responsive to roll tilt of the animal (76 neurons) and neck rotation (75 neurons) at the standard parameters of 0.026 Hz, ±10°, no significant correlation was found between gain (impulses·s-1·deg-1) of the labyrinth or neck responses and conduction velocity of the axons. Thus, due to the presence of slight negative relation between resting discharge and conduction velocity of the axons, larger neurons exhibited a greater percentage modulation (sensitivity) to the labyrinth and neck inputs than smaller neurons; this correlation involved particularly the dcLVN neurons. These findings suggest that the afferent pathways driven during dynamic stimulation of labyrinth and neck receptors produce an higher number or density of synaptic contacts on lVS neurons of increasing size. 4. No significant differences in the means of resting discharge, conduction velocity, gain and sensitivity were found between all the lVS units responding to labyrinth and neck inputs. These findings indicate that the effectiveness of the two inputs was almost comparable and did not vary in different units as a function of cell size. 5. The lVS neurons were mainly excited during side-down animal tilt and side-up neck rotation. Although these neurons showed the same spectrum of conduction velocity as those displaying the opposite response patterns, the response gains of the predominant populations of units were on the average higher than those obtained from the remaining populations of units. The peak of the unit responses occurred with an average phase lead of +21.0±27.2°, SD with respect to the extreme animal displacements, and an average phase lead of +52.0±18.3, SD with respect to the extreme neck displacements; yet no difference was found in the average phase angle of responses of the two populations of slow and fast units to animal tilt or neck rotation. These findings indicate that the quantitative and qualitative organization of the synaptic inputs represent the critical factor controlling response characteristics of comparable size lVS neurons to vestibular and neck stimulations. 6. A comparison between the present results and those obtained in previous experiments performed after bilateral ablation of the paleocerebellum permitted to evaluate the role that the inhibitory area of the cerebellum exerts on the resting discharge, as well as on the dynamic characteristics of response of different size lVS neurons to animal tilt and neck rotation. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Cell size; Neck input; Response characteristics; Vestibular input; Vestibulospinal neurons","Action Potentials; Animal; Cats; Cerebellum; Decerebrate State; Electric Stimulation; Lumbosacral Region; Movement; Neck; Neural Pathways; Neurons; Posture; Reflex; Spinal Cord; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Vestibular Nuclei; animal experiment; body position; cat; central nervous system; cerebellum; decerebration; musculoskeletal system; nonhuman; priority journal; vestibulospinal tract","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0023203983"

Half of the units tested were directionally selective. Horizontal, or downward preferred directions predominated. Most neurons were relative insensitive to changes of shape, orientation, contrast, and velocity of the visual stimulus. Some neurons preferred rapid (100°/sec) jerky movements, others required complex motions of irregular shapes, a few strongly preferred objects moving towards the animal in the midsagittal plane. 40% of neurons yielded phasic On-Off reaction to flashing stationary spots. Habituation to repeated stimulation was a common feature and occured in 50% of AMSS neurons. In 19% of neurons tested the discharge rate was not affected by saccadic eye movements, when the animal faced a patterned background. Among the remainder two types of saccade associated responses could be distinguished. Type I discharged prior to or simultaneously with the onset of saccades. This early response was usually associated with saccades of particular directions. Saccades in total darkness yielded weaker and less consistent responses. Type II discharged subsequent to the onset of the saccades after a latency of 40 msec (type IIa), 40-80 msec (type IIb) and 80 msec (type IIc). Responses of type IIa are probably consequences of the retinal effects of eye movements. The saccade associated responses of type Ia, IIb and IIc are tentatively interpreted as results of an eye movement-synchroneous subcortical input, which facilitates transmission in AMSS neurons. Presaccadic facilitation, which generates type Ia responses, may be functionally related to shifts of attention prior to eye movements. It is suggested that postsaccadic facilitation, which underlies the reactions of type IIb and IIc, may be a correlate of visual attention during the fixation period. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.","Cat; Direction sensitivity; Eye movements; Single neurons; Suprasylvian gyrus","Animal; Association; Attention; Brain Mapping; Cats; Cerebral Cortex; Electrophysiology; Eye Movements; Neurons; Reaction Time; Time Factors; Visual Cortex; Visual Perception; association cortex; brain cortex; cat; directional vision; eye movement; nerve cell membrane potential; orientation; saccadic eye movement; single unit activity; suprasylvian gyrus; theoretical study; visual cortex; visual system","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0015950066"

It was found that the area appeared to contain two groups of neurons with distinctly different spike durations, firing rates and firing patterns. One group (group A) had properties similar to those of nigral dopaminergic neurons: slow random firing rates, unusually long spike durations and slow conduction velocities. The discharge rate of the majority of these neurons was reduced by iontophoretically applied dopamine. It was concluded that neurons of this group were probably A10 dopaminergic neurons. The other group (group B) had relatively faster and rhythmical firing rates, short spike durations and faster conduction velocities and were considered to be non-dopaminergic. Forty-nine units in the ventral tegmental area were antidromically activated by electrical stimulation of the nucleus accumbens. Units antidromically activated included neurons of group A and group B, suggesting that the nucleus accumbens received dual projections of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic fibres from the ventral tegmental area. The discharge rate of 141 out of 142 neurons tested in the ventral tegmental area (group A: 66/66, group B: 75/76) was found to be reduced by GABA. The inhibition was blocked by the simultaneous application of picrotoxin. Picrotoxin alone activated 47.7% of 155 units tested.

The units recorded in this study were all spontaneously active and cardiac-locked. Two types of discharge patterns, namely single and double discharges, were identified. These single and double discharge units were found to distribute randomly in RVL. In WKY, 92.6% of RVL neurons exhibited single discharges whereas in SHR, the majority (57%) of RVL neurons exhibited double discharges. The mean firing rate of single discharge units in RVL of SHR was significantly higher than that of WKY, whereas the mean firing rate of double discharge units in WKY was similar to that of SHR. About half of the units studied were also tested for antidromic collision; all units tested could be antidromically activated from the intermediolateral column (IML) of the thoracic spinal cord and the lowest threshold sites were consistently localized within IML. In both groups of rats, the axonal conduction velocity of RVL neurons showed a bimodal distribution viz. the fast and slow conducting axons. The mean conduction velocities of each of these two groups of neurons in WKY and SHR were similar. Most of the double discharge units in WKY and SHR belonged to the fast conducting type. In comparison with WKY, the present findings in SHR demonstrated that the majority of RVL units exhibited double discharge pattern with a fast conduction velocity, and the remaining RVL units showed single discharge pattern with a higher firing rate and regularity. These properties of RVL neurons may probably contribute to the enhanced sympathetic outflow from RVL of SHR and in turn account for the higher BP observed in SHR. © 1991.","Blood pressure; Double discharge unit; Single discharge unit; Spontaneous neuronal activity; Spontaneously hypertensive rat; Ventrolateral medulla; Wistar-Kyoto rat","Animal; Axons; Blood Pressure; Electric Stimulation; Electrophysiology; Heart Conduction System; Medulla Oblongata; Neural Conduction; Neurons; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Rats, Inbred WKY; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; blood pressure; controlled study; electrophysiology; female; medulla oblongata; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; single unit activity; spontaneously hypertensive rat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025797392"

Some of these neurons showed physiological characteristics attributed to norepinephrine (NE)-containing LC neurons, i.e., (i) a slow and regular resting discharge; (ii) a typical biphasic response to compression of the paws consisting of short impulse bursts followed by a silent period, which was attributed to recurrent and/or lateral inhibition of the corresponding neurons; and (iii) a suppression of the resting discharge during episodes of postural atonia, associated with rapid eye movements (REM), induced by systemic injection of an anticholinesterase, a finding which closely resembled that occurring in intact animals during desynchronized sleep. Among the neurons tested, 80 of 141 (i.e., 56.7%) responded to the labyrinth input elicited by sinusoidal tilt about the longitudinal axis of the whole animal at the standard parameters of 0.15 Hz, ± 10°, and 73 of 99 (i.e., 73.7%) responded to the neck input elicited by rotation of the body about the longitudinal axis at the same parameters, while maintaining the head stationary.

In particular, most of the LC-complex units were maximally excited during side-up tilt of the animal and side-down neck rotation, the response peak occurring with an average phase lead of about + 17.9° and +34.2° with respect to the extreme animal and neck displacements, respectively. Similar results were also obtained from the antidromically identified coeruleospinal (CS) neurons. The degree of convergence and the modalities of interaction of vestibular and neck inputs on LC-complex neurons were also investigated. In addition to the results described above, the LC-complex neurons were also tested to changing parameters of stimulation. In particular, both static and dynamic components of single unit responses were elicited by increasing frequencies of animal tilt and neck rotation. Moreover, the relative stability of the phase angle of the responses evaluated with respect to the animal position in most of the units tested at increasing frequencies of tilt allowed the conclusion to attribute these responses to the properties of macular ultricular receptors. This conclusion is supported by the results of experiments showing that LC-complex neurons displayed steady changes in their discharge rate during static tilt of the animal. These findings are discussed in relation to the facts that: (i) the predominant patterns of response of the LC-complex neurons as well as the CS neurons to animal tilt and neck rotation are opposite to those of the vestibulospinal (VS) neurons projecting to the same segments of the spinal cord, and (ii) the former neurons exert an inhibitory influence on Renshaw cells, while the latter exert an excitatory influence on them, due to activation of ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons and their recurrent collaterals. We postulated that periodic changes in firing rate of the antidromically identified CS neurons during animal tilt and neck rotation might change the functional coupling of the ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons with their own Renshaw cells, thus intervening in the gain regulation of the corresponding VS and cervicospinal reflexes. As to the unidentified LC-complex neurons responsive to the same stimuli, they might be involved in the labyrinthine and cervical control of functions other than posture. © 1991, Elsevier B.V.
