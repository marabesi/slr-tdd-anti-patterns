"Temporal learning analytics to explore traces of self-regulated learning behaviors and their associations with learning performance, cognitive load, and student engagement in an asynchronous online course","Self-regulated learning (SRL) plays a critical role in asynchronous online courses. In recent years, attention has been focused on identifying student subgroups with different patterns of online SRL behaviors and comparing their learning performance. However, there is limited research leveraging traces of SRL behaviors to detect student subgroups and examine the subgroup differences in cognitive load and student engagement. The current study tracked the engagement of 101 graduate students with SRL-enabling tools integrated into an asynchronous online course. According to the recorded SRL behaviors, this study identified two distinct student subgroups, using sequence analysis and cluster analysis: high SRL (H-SRL) and low SRL (L-SRL) groups. The H-SRL group showed lower extraneous cognitive load and higher learning performance, germane cognitive load, and cognitive engagement than the L-SRL group did. Additionally, this study articulated and compared temporal patterns of online SRL behaviors between the student subgroups combining lag sequential analysis and epistemic network analysis. The results revealed that both groups followed three phases of self-regulation but performed off-task behaviors. Additionally, the H-SRL group preferred activating mastery learning goals to improve ethical knowledge, whereas the L-SRL group preferred choosing performance-avoidance learning goals to pass the unit tests. The H-SRL group invested more in time management and notetaking, whereas the L-SRL group engaged more in surface learning approaches. This study offers researchers both theoretical and methodological insights. Additionally, our research findings help inform practitioners about how to design and deploy personalized SRL interventions in asynchronous online courses.

The Influence of the Student's Online Learning Behaviors on the Learning Performance,"The emergence of online learning platforms means learners have a variety of learning behavior patterns. Many studies have found that there is a certain correlation between online learning behavior and learning performance. To better optimize the function of an online learning platform in hybrid teaching mode and further improve the quality of teaching and learning, this paper takes the 5y online learning platform as the target scene, and uses the online learning behavior data of 2205 learners and final exam score data as the breakthrough point of learning analytics. Through factor analysis on the behavior data of 13 measurement indicators of learners, this paper uses multiple linear regression model to analyze the correlation between learners’ online learning behavior and their final exam scores. The research found that the final examination results of learners are obviously positively correlated with the basic question factors and comprehensive question factors. Therefore, teachers and students who use 5y platform should focus on the use of knowledge point tests and unit tests to improve the quality of teaching and learning within the limited class time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Li C., Yao J., Tang Z., Tang Y., Zhang Y.",2023,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-031-25158-0_3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151135735&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-25158-0_3&partnerID=40&md5=b093106e8e0bc81246a0d4490cba8bf7
Reduced Threading Dislocation Density in a Ge Epitaxial Film on a Submicron-Patterned Si Substrate Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition,"A patterned Si substrate is used to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) in a Ge epitaxial film for near-infrared photonic device applications. Using photolithography and dry etching, an array of submicron-wide strips with a rectangular cross-section is patterned in the [110] direction of a Si (001) wafer. A Ge film as thick as 1 µm is grown on the patterned Si by chemical vapor deposition with an ordinary two-step growth method, where a buffer layer of pure Ge as thin as 50 nm is grown at a low temperature of 370°C, followed by growth at an elevated temperature of 700°C. A Ge film is formed with a reasonably flat surface despite the non-flat starting Si surface as well as the large lattice mismatch of 4.2% between Ge and Si. The etch-pit density measurements for the Ge film exhibits TDD of about 6 × 107 cm–2, which is significantly lower than that of about 2 × 108 cm–2 for the film on the unpatterned region prepared on the same Si substrate. The TDD reduction is attributed to a trapping of the dislocations in the trench regions between the Si strips, as observed in cross-sectional transmission electron microscope images. © 2023, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.","Amin M.F.B., Hizawa T., Piedra-Lorenzana J.A., Nakai T., Ishikawa Y.",2023,Scopus,10.1007/s11664-023-10302-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149861797&doi=10.1007%2fs11664-023-10302-3&partnerID=40&md5=13156c6ba321cd3f78582c8f4c43724c

Antenna Array Diversity Evaluation Under Multipath Environments With Digital Beamforming,"This work proposes a methodology for evaluating the antenna array diversity and resultant radiation pattern from digitally-processed-based beamforming systems. Our approach enables to interpret the advanced antenna systems (AAS) coverage and massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) spatial resolution, by the inspection of the array resultant multiple beams. Particularly, the impact on the mMIMO spatial resolution is conducted as a function of the channel correlation, by means of an exclusively radiofrequency (RF) approach, with the advantage of not considering the system-level features, and using a new figure of merit ( \Lambda factor). The new figure of merit enables to evaluate the antenna array diversity from two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) beamforming, by computing the number of lobes with gain higher than a unique element. In the 3D case, the figure of merit is based on a differential calculation, which enables performing an infinitesimal counting of lobes per antenna element beamwidth. Such parameter is initially applied to a theoretical dipole-based array, with the purpose of quantifying the created multiple beams by the overlapped radiation patterns from mMIMO systems. Furthermore, the \Lambda factor is exploited for analyzing the performance of a 64-element and dual-polarized SICL-based slot antenna array and a 64-element dipole-based antenna prototypes, both previously developed by our research group. Finally, it is demonstrated that the \Lambda factor increases as diversity increases and dipole-based antenna array could be used as an upper limit, attaining 11.46 lobes/rad © 2020 IEEE.","Filgueiras H.R.D., Brandao T.H., Pereira L.A.M., Junior A.C.S.",2023,Scopus,10.1109/OJAP.2023.3252047,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149364404&doi=10.1109%2fOJAP.2023.3252047&partnerID=40&md5=0d432ea745609447950c8c050ccf7ed7
LensFD: Using Lenses for Improved Sub-6 GHz Massive MIMO Full-Duplex,"Massive MIMO has emerged as a key-enabler to deliver the high data-rates in current and next-generation systems. Many massive MIMO deployments use time-division duplex (TDD), thereby opening the door for the potential use of full-duplex at base-stations. In this paper, we present LensFD, a scalable method to enable cost-effective massive MIMO full-duplex operation in sub-6 GHz frequencies with a focus on the CBRS band of 3.5 GHz. LensFD uses a low-cost lens array combined with transmit precoding to reshape the effective beam pattern of antennas in massive MIMO arrays to reduce self-interference. We tested three lens configurations in LensFD experimentally with a software-defined 40-antenna base-station and demonstrate a significant improvement in self-interference reduction and hence overall increased system capacity to 1.6&#x00D7; over the TDD counterpart. As an important contribution, we will open-source the large measurement dataset from our experiments.

Identifying Guidelines for Test-Driven Development in Software Engineering—A Literature Review,"With the significance, ubiquity, and complexity of information technology continuously rising, the corresponding quality assurance becomes increasingly important and challenging. Consequently, numerous tools, techniques, paradigms, and strategies that facilitate the quality assurance of the developed applications have emerged. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of those strategies. In contrast to the traditional approach, it places testing ahead of the actual implementation, which, in turn, also heavily influences the system’s design. With the approach being rather complex, naturally, guidance on its correct application is one of the most relevant aspects for many practitioners. To provide assistance to them, but also to researchers concerned with the domain, the publication at hand identifies twenty guidelines for the practical application of TDD in software engineering, by conducting a structured literature review. In doing so, it provides a solid foundation for the implementation of corresponding endeavors as well as a starting point for further discussion. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Staegemann D., Volk M., Pohl M., Haertel C., Hintsch J., Turowski K.",2023,Scopus,10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136982061&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-2397-5_30&partnerID=40&md5=09b9899427719df081e3c6f7a973297f
"Gradient-Based Predictive Pulse Pattern Control of Medium-Voltage Drives-Part I: Control, Concept, and Analysis","This article proposes a control and modulation strategy for medium-voltage (MV) drives that exhibits excellent steady-state and transient behavior. Specifically, optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) and direct model predictive control are employed so that the associated advantages of both, such as minimum stator current total demand distortion (TDD) and fast transients, respectively, are fully exploited. To do so, the current reference trajectory tracking and modulation problems are addressed in a coordinated manner in the form of a constrained optimization problem that utilizes the knowledge of the stator current evolution-as described by its gradient-within the prediction horizon. Solving this problem yields the optimal real-time modification of the offline-computed OPP, which guarantees that very low-and close to its theoretical minimum value-stator current TDD is produced at steady state, and very short settling times during transients. To highlight the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a variable speed drive system consisting of a three-level neutral point clamped inverter and an MV induction machine serves as a case study. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Begh M.A.W., Karamanakos P., Geyer T.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/TPEL.2022.3190708,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135223002&doi=10.1109%2fTPEL.2022.3190708&partnerID=40&md5=1b8b930a7de52f6721f95e32654a4c18
Gradient-Based Predictive Pulse Pattern Control of Medium-Voltage Drives-Part II: Performance Assessment,"In this article, the performance of gradient-based predictive pulse pattern control (GP 3C) is evaluated for a medium-voltage variable-speed drive consisting of a three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter and a medium-voltage induction machine. To this end, real-time tests are performed in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) environment, which, along with extensive simulation studies, elucidate the potential of performance gains achieved with GP3C. As shown, by manipulating offline-computed optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) in real time such that the stator current of the machine follows a precalculated optimal current trajectory, superior steady-state and transient performance can be achieved. Specifically, the current total demand distortion (TDD) is significantly reduced compared with established control methods, such as field-oriented control (FOC) with space vector modulation (SVM), while shorter settling times during transients are achieved. Finally, to complete the assessment of the control method of interest, real-time implementation aspects are discussed in detail. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Begh M.A.W., Karamanakos P., Geyer T., Yang Q.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/TPEL.2022.3190713,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135204053&doi=10.1109%2fTPEL.2022.3190713&partnerID=40&md5=e7f576a4f258dd175475117915c731fa
Simulation Platform Development for Diabetes and Technology Self-Management,"Background: Specialized education is critical for optimal insulin pump use but is not widely utilized or accessible. We aimed to (1) test the usability and acceptability of A1Control, a simulation platform supporting insulin pump education, and (2) determine predictors of performance. Method: Rural adult insulin pump users with type 1 diabetes (T1D) participated in a mixed methods usability study in 2 separate rounds. Participants navigated 3 simulations (ie, infusion site occlusion, hypoglycemia, exercise). Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Systems Usability Scale (SUS) were administered. Semi-structured interviews and direct observation were used to assess perceived usability, acceptability and performance. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique was used to fit predictive models for visualization of patterns leading to good or poor A1Control performance. Results: Participants (N = 13) were 28-70 years old, 10 used automated insulin delivery and 12 used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Mean NPS was 9.5 (range 9-10) and positive sentiment during interviews indicated very high acceptability. SUS (mean 88.5, range 70-100) indicted a high perceived usability. CGM percent wear ≥ 94%, time spent in hypoglycemia ≤ 54 mg/dl of <0.01%, and <70 mg/dl of 0.5% predicted successful site-occlusion scenario performance with 100% accuracy. BOLUS score ≥ 2, TDD ≥ 34, and technology brand predicted exercise scenario success with 100% accuracy. There were an insufficient number of failed hypoglycemia scenarios to assess predictors. Conclusion: A1Control shows potential to increase access and frequency of self-management and technology education.

Demo: On enabling 5G Dynamic TDD by leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning and O-RAN,"Dynamic Time Duplex Division (D-TDD) is a promising solution to accommodate the new emerging 5G and 6G services characterised by the asymmetric and dynamic Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL) traffic demands. D-TDD dynamically changes the TDD configuration of a cell without interrupting users' connectivity, hence balancing the bandwidth for UL or DL communication according to the traffic pattern. However, 3GPP standard does not specify algorithms or solutions to derive the TDD configuration, i.e., the number of slots to dedicate to UL and DL. In [1], we have proposed a Machine Learning (ML)-based solution relaying on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to allow the base station (or gNB) to self-adapt to the traffic pattern of the cell by periodically adapting the number of slots dedicated to UL and DL. In this work, we implemented the DRL algorithm on top of an open-source gNB based on OpenAirInterface (OAI) [3] to demonstrate its efficiency. To this end, we relied on the O-RAN architecture [5], where the proposed DRL algorithm is deployed as xApp at the Near Real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) and communicates with the base station using O-RAN E2 interface. We developed xTDD Service Model (SM) following the E2SM standard [5], allowing the DRL solution to monitor DL and UL buffers from the gNB to deduce the optimal TDD configuration that accommodates the current traffic. Then, the decision (i.e., TDD configuration) is pushed to the base station. We implemented the solution on top of the OAI 5G StandAlone (SA) platform and Open Networking Foundation (ONF) RIC [4] based on μonos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a ML-based D-TDD on top of a real 5G network, showing the advantage of O-RAN architecture to building Self Organized Network (SON) function for dynamic configuration of D-TDD. © 2022 ACM.","Boutiba K., Bagaa M., Ksentini A.",2022,Scopus,10.1145/3492866.3561252,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139714964&doi=10.1145%2f3492866.3561252&partnerID=40&md5=b997802d22dff22c13c0e3c5b63e6f47

Reduced threading dislocation density in a germanium epitaxial film coalesced on an arrayed silicon-on-insulator strip,"This paper reports a reduction in the threading dislocation density (TDD) of a Ge epitaxial film on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) wafer in terms of the Si-photonics device application. An array of submicron SOI strips is prepared as a patterned substrate, on which Ge is epitaxially grown by chemical vapor deposition. A continuous Ge film is formed by a coalescence of the adjacent Ge crystals on the arrayed SOI strip, while leaving semicylindrical voids on the exposed surface of the buried SiO2 (BOX) layer between the strips. The TDD of the coalesced Ge film is reduced to 1.0 ± 0.1 × 108cm-2, which is approximately a half of 2.2 ± 0.2 × 108cm-2 for a Ge film on an unpatterned SOI. A transmission electron microscope observation reveals that the TDD reduction is derived from a downward bending of the dislocation toward the void. An accumulation of the dislocations at the strip sidewalls also contributes to the TDD reduction. © 2022 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Bin Amin M.F., Motomura K., Hizawa T., Piedra-Lorenzana J.A., Nakai T., Ishikawa Y.",2022,Scopus,10.35848/1347-4065/ac8630,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136561875&doi=10.35848%2f1347-4065%2fac8630&partnerID=40&md5=8743619365e92cceb228618efde99ce4
Physical Layer Security Design for Polar Code Construction,"In contrast to the network security that relies on upper-layer encryption for the confiden-tiality and authenticity of communications, physical layer security (PLS) exploits the uniqueness and randomness of the physical channel to encrypt information and enhance the security of the system. In this paper, we study the PLS of a polar-coded wireless communication system. To be more specific, we leverage the unique properties in polar code construction and propose a channel quality indicator (CQI)-based frozen-bit pattern generation scheme. The transmitter employs the Gaussian approxima-tion algorithm to generate the corresponding frozen bit pattern according to the instantaneous CQI of the legitimate link. At the receiver, by leveraging the full channel reciprocity in the time-division duplex (TDD) mode, we can map the CQI to the corresponding frozen bit pattern and correctly decode the received bits. By contrast, the eavesdropper was unable to have the knowledge of the le-gal channel, and hence cannot determine the frozen bit pattern of the polar-coded bit sequence. Our simulation results demonstrate that by adopting the proposed PLS key generation scheme, Eve was hardly able to correctly decode a complete frame, leading to a high block error rate (BLER), while Bob was able to attain a 10−5 BLER. © 2022 by the authors.

Model-based testing leveraged for automated web tests,"Agile methods and their practices have fostered the widespread presence of automated test cases. Such test cases have been successfully and extensively adopted to test different software levels, from unit tests (e.g., JUnit) to end-to-end Web Graphical User Interface (GUI) tests (e.g., Selenium Webdriver). While test execution is mostly automated by existing tools, test design remains a manual task. In the pursuit of a more automated test case generation approach, the use of models has been advocated by the model-based testing (MBT) technique. Current MBT approaches assume a top-down workflow in which testers design models, test cases are generated from models, and then scripts are written to automate test execution. Nevertheless, writing automated tests is nowadays a developer’s responsibility and testers face a scenario in which automated tests might be reused to produce new model-based tests. This paper aimed to improve the synergy between existing automated tests and MBT. To do so, we present an approach that infers a model from existing tests, a tester leverages this model to include new tests, and then test code is generated. We analyzed the proposed approach in the context of Web applications with system-level GUI tests that employ the Page Object pattern. For MBT, we adopted event-driven models augmented with parameters and test input data. We evaluated the approach’s applicability with a prototype tool called MoLeWe and an experimental study with nine open-source Web applications. The results provide some evidence that using MoLeWe may help to include new tests faster than manually coding them, while increasing the overall code coverage of the test suite. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Mattiello G.R., Endo A.T.",2022,Scopus,10.1007/s11219-021-09575-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120068446&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-021-09575-w&partnerID=40&md5=b5694b47577ca52b73c2982a79f826eb
Security-Oriented Polar Coding Based on Channel-Gain-Mapped Frozen Bits,"In this paper, a novel design named security-oriented polar coding (SOPC) is proposed to enhance the physical layer security (PLS), where the active pattern of frozen bits in a transmission is determined by random channel gain of the legitimate link. Since the channel gain value is not exchanged between the legitimate transmitter and the desired receiver, eavesdroppers cannot ascertain the frozen bit pattern engaged in the legitimate polar coding. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, eavesdroppers are unable to appropriately decode the confidential information delivered over the legitimate link. As the SNR increases, eavesdroppers may have chance to sort out the correct frozen bit pattern through a brute-force search. However, this chance is significantly reduced by our SOPC. We design the SOPC for both single-input-single-output single-antenna eavesdropper (SISOSE) and multiple-input-multiple-output multi-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) channels. Its PLS functioning is assessed in terms of the error rate difference between the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Illustrative simulation results substantiate that the SOPC design guarantees degraded decoding performance at eavesdroppers, for both SISOSE and MIMOME channels, even in the presence of a powerful eavesdropper possessing infinite computational resources. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Yang Y., Li W.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/TWC.2022.3151188,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125292934&doi=10.1109%2fTWC.2022.3151188&partnerID=40&md5=c2deb715cc6f66c8007053eee0313305
Injection testing backed refactoring,"Injection-based testing for refactoring is a pattern that minimizes the need for manual editing when altering the internal behaviour of a code base which does not have unit tests yet in place. Neither does it rely on a compilation or a linking process nor does it make assumptions on the structure of the code. Thus, it can be particularly useful for refactoring code that has been written in scripting languages, and specifically targets the research and engineering context. We describe the pattern and propose a set of functions for its application. The applicability of code injection for refactoring is highlighted via specific examples for deriving unit and integration tests.

Machine Learning Based Propagation Loss Module for Enabling Digital Twins of Wireless Networks in ns-3,"The creation of digital twins of experimental testbeds allows the validation of novel wireless networking solutions and the evaluation of their performance in realistic conditions, without the cost, complexity and limited availability of experimental testbeds. Current trace-based simulation approaches for ns-3 enable the repetition and reproduction of the same exact conditions observed in past experiments. However, they are limited by the fact that the simulation setup must exactly match the original experimental setup, including the network topology, the mobility patterns and the number of network nodes. In this paper, we propose the Machine Learning based Propagation Loss (MLPL) module for ns-3. Based on network traces collected in an experimental testbed, the MLPL module estimates the propagation loss as the sum of a deterministic path loss and a stochastic fast-fading loss. The MLPL module is validated with unit tests. Moreover, we test the MLPL module with real network traces, and compare the results obtained with existing propagation loss models in ns-3 and real experimental results. The results obtained show that the MLPL module can accurately predict the propagation loss observed in a real environment and reproduce the experimental conditions of a given testbed, enabling the creation of digital twins of wireless network environments in ns-3. © 2022 ACM.","Almeida E.N., Rushad M., Kota S.R., Nambiar A., Harti H.L., Gupta C., Waseem D., Santos G., Fontes H., Campos R., Tahiliani M.P.",2022,Scopus,10.1145/3532577.3532607,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133330513&doi=10.1145%2f3532577.3532607&partnerID=40&md5=26bd571940c6bbb9329b70ecc04a6ff7
Empirical Study on 5G NR Cochannel Coexistence,"The 5G non-public network deployments for industrial applications are becoming highly interesting for industries and enterprises owing to dependable wireless performance characteris-tics. With an increasing trend of network deployments in local licensed and/or shared spectrum, coexistence issues naturally arise. In this article, we present our detailed empirical results on the performance impact of a 5G NR indoor non-public network from a 5G NR outdoor network operating in the same mid-band spectrum. We present experimental results on the uplink and downlink performance impact of a non-public indoor network deployed on an industrial shopfloor. Our results quantify the impact on the uplink and downlink performance characteristics based on realistic traffic loads in a non-public indoor network when using synchronized and unsynchronized Time Division Duplex (TDD) patterns, different UE deployment locations and interference levels. We also present results on mitigating interference effects through robust link adaptation techniques. We believe that this is the first article, which reports quantified 5G NR cochannel coexistence results based on a detailed and systematic study, and provides signficant insights on the cochannel coexistence behavior in realistic deployment scenarios of an industrial shopfloor. © 2022 by the authors.

Structure design of multi-functional flexible electrocardiogram electrodes based on PEDOT:PSS-coated fabrics,"Herein, Polyester woven fabrics as the matrices for the experimental group, while cotton knitted fabrics, cotton woven fabrics, and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mesh cloth used as the matrices for the control groups, at 40 °e, using 3,4-ethoxylene dioxy thiophene (EDOT)as the polymer monomer, FeCl3 as the oxidant, and poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as the dopant, are separately coated with PEDOT:PSS polymer to prepare flexible conductive composite fabrics. The influences of the fabric pattern, oxidant concentration, and monomer concentration on the electrical performance of composite fabrics are optimized. The maximal electrical conductivity of PET-based composite fabrics (218 S/m) occurs when monomer concentration is 0.035 mol/L, the molar ratio of oxidant to monomer is 2.5, and the dopant concentration is 2.5 g/L. Moreover, bacteriostasis rate of this composite fabric reaches 71.8%. Furthermore, by electrocardiogram (ECG) simulated human body unit test as well as human body ECG test, the optimal PET-based composite fabric electrode both has a lower impedance which helps form the stabilized ECG signal. The resulting fabric electrodes retain the soft and breathable advantages from fabrics and reduce the discomfort for a long-term use of conventional electrographic gel, thereby validating the empirical evidence for mobile, portable, wearable ECG electrodes. © The Author(s) 2021.","Lin J.-H., Fu X., Li T.-T., Zhang X., Zhao B., Shiu B.-C., Wang H., Jiang Q., Lou C.-W.",2022,Scopus,10.1177/15280837211022637,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108848223&doi=10.1177%2f15280837211022637&partnerID=40&md5=b7436aac2456ebdad6581748da1feaea
"Three-variate trajectories of metabolic control, body mass index, and insulin dose: Heterogeneous response to initiation of pump therapy in youth with type 1 diabetes","Objective: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in youths with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is often associated with lower HbA1c, lower total daily insulin dose (TDD), and lower body mass index (BMI) compared with multiple daily injections (MDI). Individual responses to CSII are diverse. The aim was to identify unique three-variate patterns of HbA1c, BMI standard deviation score (SDS), and TDD after switching to CSII. Methods: Five thousand one hundred and thirty-three youths (≤20 years; 48% boys; median age at pump start 12.5 years) with T1D duration ≥3 years at CSII initiation were selected from the multicenter DPV registry. We applied group-based multitrajectory modeling to identify groups of individuals following similar trajectories. Measurements were aggregated quarterly during a 3-year follow-up period. Trajectory variables were changes of HbA1c, BMI-SDS, and TDD from baseline (delta = quarterly aggregated values at each time point [i] minus the respective baseline value). Results: Four groups of diverging Delta-HbA1c, Delta-BMI-SDS, and Delta-TDD patterns were identified. All showed improvements in HbA1c during the first 3 months. Group 1 (12%) was characterized by modest HbA1c increase thereafter, TDD reduction, and stable BMI-SDS. In Group 2 (39%), increasing HbA1c, decreasing BMI-SDS, and stable TDD were found. By contrast, sustainably improved HbA1c, increasing BMI-SDS, and stable TDD were observed in Group 3 (32%). Group 4 (17%) was characterized by increasing levels for HbA1c, BMI-SDS, and TDD. Between-group differences in baseline HbA1c, BMI-SDS, TDD as well as in sex ratio, age at diabetes onset and at pump start were observed. Conclusions: Definite trajectories of glycemic control, BMI, and TDD over 3 years after CSII initiation were identified in youths with T1D allowing a more personalized treatment recommendation. © 2022 The Authors.

Application of patterned sapphire substrate for III-nitride light-emitting diodes,"Recent decades have witnessed flourishing prosperity of III-nitride emitters in solid-state lighting and high-resolution displays. As one of the widely used substrates, sapphire shows superiority for heteroepitaxial growth of III-nitride light-emitting diode (LED) structure, due to the advantages of stability, low cost, high mechanical strength, as well as mature fabrication technology. However, realization of efficient LEDs grown on sapphire substrate is impeded by high density of defects in epilayers and low light extraction efficiency. The emergence of patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) turns out to be a promising and effective technology to overcome these problems and enhance the LED performances. In this review, we first introduce the background and recent advances of PSS applied in III-nitride visible and ultraviolet LEDs are. Then, we summarize the fabrication methods of PSS, together with novel methods to define nanometre-scale patterned structures. We further demonstrate the effect of PSS that contributes to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) of epilayers in detail. Meanwhile, mechanism of light extraction efficiency enhancement by adopting PSS is presented based on numerical analysis. Next, we explore the influence of PSS structural parameters (e.g. pattern size, pattern shape and aspect ratio) on LED performances, spanning from visible to deep ultraviolet UV emission region. Finally, challenges and potential prospects in PSS for future LED development are proposed and forecasted as well. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Zhou S., Zhao X., Du P., Zhang Z., Liu X., Liu S., Guo L.J.",2022,Scopus,10.1039/d1nr08221c,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127893055&doi=10.1039%2fd1nr08221c&partnerID=40&md5=c662b39aeb3b306084386ad20a89602c
Diurnal Variation of Real-Life Insulin Sensitivity Factor Among Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Using Ultra-Long-Acting Basal Insulin Analogs,"Background: Estimation of insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) is essential for correction insulin doses calculation. This study aimed to assess real-life ISF among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogs and to detect factors associated with ISF among those patients. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted at Sohag University Hospital, Egypt, and included 93 participants aged 6–18 years, diagnosed with T1DM for at least 1 year and using insulin glargine 300 Units/mL or insulin degludec 100 Units/mL as basal insulin. The ISF, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) and insulin doses were initially assessed then adjusted as required. The participants were regularly contacted throughout the follow-up period. Glycemic control parameters were assessed after 3 months. Results: The ISF showed diurnal variation with higher correction dose requirements for the morning than for the rest of the day (p &lt; 0.001). This pattern of diurnal variation was found in participants with different pubertal stages and in participants using either type of ultra-long acting basal insulin analogs. There was no significant difference between the ISF calculated according to the 1800 rule [1800/Total daily insulin dose (TDD)] and the morning ISF (p = 0.25). The 1800 rule-calculated ISF was significantly lower than the actual ISF for the afternoon (p &lt; 0.001) and the evening (p &lt; 0.001). ISF at different times of the day were significantly correlated with age, body mass index, pubertal stage, diabetes duration, TDD, and ICR. Multiple regression analysis revealed that ICR was the most significant factor associated with ISF. Linear regression analysis revealed that the ISF (in mg/dL) for any time of the day could be estimated as 5.14 × ICR for the same time of the day (coefficient = 5.14, 95% confidence interval: 5.10–5.19, R2 = 0.95, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Diurnal variation of ISF that had to be considered for proper calculation of correction doses. This diurnal variation was found in children and adolescents with different pubertal stages. The 1800 rule was appropriate for the morning correction doses but not in the afternoon or the evening. The TDD and the ICR could be used for ISF estimation.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Fully Decentralized Dynamic Time Division Configuration for 5G and B5G Network,"Future network services must adapt to the highly dynamic uplink and downlink traffic. To fulfill this requirement, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) proposed dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) technology in Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release 11. Afterward, the 3GPP RAN#86 meeting clarified that 5G NR needs to support dynamic adjustment of the duplex pattern (transmission direction) in the time domain. Although 5G NR provides a more flexible duplex pattern, how to configure an effective duplex pattern according to services traffic is still an open research area. In this research, we propose a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based decentralized D-TDD configuration method. First, we model a D-TDD configuration problem as a dynamic programming problem. Given the buffer length of all UE, we model the D-TDD configuration policy as a conditional probability distribution. Our goal is to find a D-TDD configuration policy that maximizes the expected discount return of all UE’s sum rates. Second, in order to reduce signaling overhead, we design a fully decentralized solution with distributed MARL technology. Each agent in MARL makes decisions only based on local observations. We regard each base station (BS) as an agent, and each agent configures uplink and downlink time slot ratio according to length of intra-BS user (UE) queue buffer. Third, in order to solve the problem of overall system revenue caused by the lack of global information in MARL, we apply leniency control and binary LSTM (BLSTM) based auto-encoder. Leniency controller effectively controls Q-value estimation process in MARL according to Q-value and current network conditions, and auto-encoder makes up for the defect that leniency control cannot handle complex environments and high-dimensional data. Through the parallel distributed training, the global D-TDD policy is obtained. This method deploys the MARL algorithm on the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server of each BS and uses the storage and computing capabilities of the server for distributed training. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed MARL converges stably in various environments, and performs better than distributed deep reinforcement algorithm. © 2022 by the authors.

Twins: BFT Systems Made Robust,"This paper presents Twins, an automated unit test generator of Byzantine attacks. Twins implements three types of Byzantine behaviors: (i) leader equivocation, (ii) double voting, and (iii) losing internal state such as forgetting “locks” guarding voted values. To emulate interesting attacks by a Byzantine node, it instantiates twin copies of the node instead of one, giving both twins the same identities and network credentials. To the rest of the system, the twins appear indistinguishable from a single node behaving in a “questionable” manner. Twins can systematically generate Byzantine attack scenarios at scale, execute them in a controlled manner, and examine their behavior. Twins scenarios iterate over protocol rounds and vary the communication patterns among nodes. Twins runs in a production setting within DiemBFT where it can execute 44M Twins-generated scenarios daily. Whereas the system at hand did not manifest errors, subtle safety bugs that were deliberately injected for the purpose of validating the implementation of Twins itself were exposed within minutes. Twins can prevent developers from regressing correctness when updating the codebase, introducing new features, or performing routine maintenance tasks. Twins only requires a thin wrapper over DiemBFT, we thus envision other systems using it. Building on this idea, one new attack and several known attacks against other BFT protocols were materialized as Twins scenarios. In all cases, the target protocols break within fewer than a dozen protocol rounds, hence it is realistic for the Twins approach to expose the problems. © Shehar Bano, Alberto Sonnino, Andrey Chursin, Dmitri Perelman, Zekun Li, Avery Ching, and Dahlia Malkhi.","Bano S., Chursin A., Li Z., Malkhi D., Sonnino A., Perelman D., Ching A.",2022,Scopus,10.4230/LIPIcs.OPODIS.2021.7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127416398&doi=10.4230%2fLIPIcs.OPODIS.2021.7&partnerID=40&md5=c24d4c386128ffd3209f2b7385e84f63
Migration of hyper-fractal analysis from visual basic 6 to C#.Net,"In Grossu et al. (Comput. Phys. Commun. 184 (2013) 1812–1813) we presented Hyper-Fractal Analysis, a visual tool for estimating the fuzzy fractal dimension of images and 4D objects. As Visual Basic 6 could be considered an outdated language, with limited Object-Oriented Programming capabilities, migrating the application to C#.Net was treated in high priority. Following the goal of creating a highly reusable fractal analysis library, the code was also refactored to SOLID. Together with various improvements, the.Net version is also providing new tools for iso-fractal areas identification. The project success was confirmed by a comparative old/new version study. On the other hand, the most relevant functionalities were covered by unit tests. New version program summary: Program Title: Hyper-Fractal Analysis v05 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/z9knmny56p.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv2 Programming language: C# 7.3 /.Net Framework 4.7.1 Journal reference of previous version: Computer Physics Communications 184, Issue 7 (2013) 1812–1813 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Estimating the fractal dimension of images and multi-dimensional objects. Solution method: Optimized version of the fuzzy box-counting algorithm. Reasons for the new version: Migration from VB6 to C#.Net, adding new tools for iso-fractal areas identification. Summary of revisions: • The main goal of this work was creating a highly reusable fractal analysis library. Following this purpose Hyper-Fractal Analysis v04 [1] was migrated from VB6 (an outdated language, with limited OOP capabilities) to C#.Net [2]. This opportunity was also used for refactoring the code to SOLID [3]. • The box-counting algorithm [4] implemented in the previous version is limited to 4D objects. In current version the number of dimensions is limited only by the available resources. • The previous fuzzy [5,6] box-counting implementation is accepting only 0-255 shades of gray windows. The new version allows defining parametrizable fuzzy band-pass filters. • An important attention was also paid on developing new tools for identification of iso-fractal areas (the sets of points characterized by the same local fractal dimension [7]). This functionality is expected to be of particular interest in medical image analysis [7-13]. • The Windows Forms GUI (Fig. 1) was completely reconsidered on top of the Model View Presenter pattern [14]. • For an increased reliability and for minimizing the regression risks during future developments the most relevant functionalities were covered by unit tests [15].

Hybrid Spectrum Access for V2V Heterogeneous Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"This paper studies the hybrid spectrum access for cellular vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) heterogeneous networks (Het-Nets) exploiting deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology. In the system, macro cell users (M-UEs), V2V clusters (V-Clusters) and V2V nodes are distributed in the time-division duplex (TDD) cellular networks, where all users share the cellular uplink resources for spectrum access. M-UEs and V-Clusters adopt orthogonal access patterns. V2V nodes expect to obtain an optimal strategy to reuse other users' resource for access while preventing other users from serious interference, which is difficult due to the limited information of other users' access patterns. Thus, DRL technology is used to train V2V nodes in an unsupervised way, where the spectrum access can be optimized without any prior information. Specifically, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) based hybrid spectrum access (D2HSA) algorithm is designed for maximizing the sum throughput of the HetNets, which makes the V2V nodes intelligently select suitable frames for spectrum access. Furthermore, in order to improve the stability of individual throughput for V2V nodes, the proposed algorithm is adjusted by considering stability in the design of the objective function. Last, the experiment results illustrate that our proposed scheme could reach an optimal throughput referring to the theoretic limit for different cases, and the performance greatly outperforms the scheme relying on the cooperation of base station. © 2022 IEEE.","Huang J., Peng J., Xiang H., Li L., Yang Y.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/WCSP55476.2022.10039356,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149151765&doi=10.1109%2fWCSP55476.2022.10039356&partnerID=40&md5=0f51eeea7f0e1133cb207262cc5de612
Novel method for synthesis of synchronization signal abstraction for 5G RF repeater,"It is important to acquire accurate synchronization in the time division duplex (TDD) system that uses downlink and uplink separately in time because interference exists when downlink and uplink time slots overlap. It is also important to know the precise timing of downlink and uplink for the 5G RF repeater that receives the signal of the base station with the link antenna, amplifies it, and serves through a service antenna because the 5G RF repeater also switches the roles of link antenna and service antenna when switching downlink and uplink. The synchronization signal block (SSB) decoding method is used to know the downlink and uplink timings of the base station. However, this method has the disadvantage that it cannot be used when the SS signal to interference and noise ratio (SS-SINR) is below the decodable SINR such as the boundary of multiple cells. This paper proposes a new method of synchronization signal abstraction that can acquire synchronization even in the section where SS-SINR is below the decodable SINR due to SS-SINR interference by introducing a way to acquire synchronization without decoding by receiving SSB and identifying its pattern. The new method of synchronization signal abstraction can increase the installation coverage of the 5G RF repeater by 293% compared to the SSB decoding method. © 2022 IEEE.","Lee K.-Y., Jang J.-S.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/AICT55583.2022.10013649,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147545700&doi=10.1109%2fAICT55583.2022.10013649&partnerID=40&md5=3e97fec3ff0a4e8b5cfe3d5d8da13ef2
TDD frame design for interference handling in mobile IAB networks,"Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) is envisioned as a possible solution to address the need for network densification in situations where fiber connection is not viable. In Release 18, 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) will take another step on extending IAB capabilities. With mobile IAB (mIAB), IAB nodes can be deployed within vehicles, e.g., buses. As in every new technology, performance assessment and evaluation of the impact of interference is of interest for industry and academia. In this paper, we present contributions on those topics. First, we evaluate the performance of mIAB compared to fiber-connected deployments. Moreover, we study the impact of interference on the performance of mIAB networks and propose a solution based on inserting silent slots on the time division duplex (TDD) frame pattern. According to our simulation results, mIAB is capable of improving performance of onboard user equipments (UEs) without harming too much the quality of service (QoS) of surrounding UEs. Furthermore, we show that the TDD frame pattern should be carefully designed to account for scenarios with different levels of interference. © 2022 IEEE.","Monteiro V.F., Lima F.R.M., Moreira D.C., Sousa D.A., MacIel T.F., Makki B., Shreevastav R., Hannu H.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001454,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146943812&doi=10.1109%2fGLOBECOM48099.2022.10001454&partnerID=40&md5=609f6055edbfbd2d11cae11e1d696220
A Comprehensive Experiment Approach to Enhancing Computer Engineering Ability,"This Research to Practice Full Paper presented a comprehensive experiment approach to enhancing computer engineering ability. This approach integrated Swift programming language, iOS development, UML, software testing, MVC, Cocoa Touch Framework and Design Patterns into a comprehensive experiment, through which students can master the engineering methods to solve complex application problems.In college, traditional computer programming courses focus on the grammar and classical algorithm of programming language. Usually the amount of code is far lower than that of industrial products. Such programming courses can't effectively improve students' ability to solve complex engineering problems. They also can't meet the requirements of industrial development. Students are not satisfied with the results of these courses. There is an intense need for the studies of enhancing student's computer engineering ability.Taking Swift Language Programming course as an example, this paper presented a comprehensive experiment approach to enhancing students' computer engineering ability by developing classic industrial iOS Apps.Flipped classroom pedagogy is conducive to free much time in class. Lecturers can fully communicate with students and help students complete challenging tasks. The comprehensive experiment consists of pre-class activities and in-class activities. Before class, the lecturer provides experiment materials online including theoretical handouts of Design Patterns, manuals of UML 2.0 specifications and Cocoa Touch reference manual, etc. Students learn the materials by themselves, practice and discuss online and complete the corresponding pre-class tests. In class, the lecturer analyzes in detail the problems students encounter after class and guides them to solve these problems. The lecturer also participates in each group discussion to ensure the smooth progress of students' project.The implementation of comprehensive experiment is divided into four sub tasks. These tasks are app function analysis, App detailed design, programming implementation, and App release and launch. First, according to the requirements of the App, the function is analyzed in detail and defined with UML. Second, based on functional analysis, the App's system architecture, data structure, view combination, logic execution process and core algorithms are designed. The system is defined in detail with UML Class diagram. Third, according to the detailed design of the App, user interface is built by Xcode storyboard, and the model layer, view layer and control layer are implemented in Swift. Then unit test and system test are conducted on the App and bugs are repaired. Finally, App launch is completed including App internationalization, developer certificate applying, creating description file, setting product identification and deployment information, and submitting App online.To assess the effect of this comprehensive experiment approach, three-year teaching data were analyzed using statistical methods. The results show that students' engineering ability (measured by code scale) and student satisfaction (measured by questionnaires) were significantly improved.Our contribution is to propose a detailed comprehensive experiment approach to enhancing computer engineering ability. The analysis of teaching data show that it is helpful to improve students' computer engineering ability and course satisfaction. © 2022 IEEE.","Zhang L., Niu J.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962680,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143779677&doi=10.1109%2fFIE56618.2022.9962680&partnerID=40&md5=098cd48a6c39c9e06066465bf0e2b54d
GaN growth by MOVPE on patterned SOI substrates: from high-quality GaN platelets to micro LEDs,"This work presents the use of nanopendeo-epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) nano-pillars to produce 20x20 μm2 low threading dislocation density (TDD) GaN platelets, with a TDD <3×108 cm-2 for their subsequent use as templates for GaN microLEDs. After discussing the general growth strategy, the correlation between optical and structural characterizations will illustrate the behavior of dislocations from the initial GaN/SOI pillars to the GaN platelets surface. Finally, we demonstrate that a state of the art TDD for GaN on silicon lower than 3×108 cm-2 can be achieved by changing the growth mode in Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE). © 2022 IEEE.","Baril K., Coulon P.-M., Mrad M., Dupre L., Feuillet G., Charles M., Gourgon C., Vennegues P., Alloing B., Perez J.Z.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/CSW55288.2022.9930384,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142607475&doi=10.1109%2fCSW55288.2022.9930384&partnerID=40&md5=5f82af9dfd026577c61a8cf1049ac8f0
Bonding Functionality for Live Video Streaming over 5G networks,"Since inception, large parts of the broadcasters' industry have envisioned 5G as the new era in which Uplink (UL) live video quality transmission over a single cellular modem is possible. Even more so, at a very low latency. 5G, mainly StandAlone (SA) but also Non-SA (NSA) architectures, both Non-Public-Network (NPN) and commercial public network, was hailed as the solution enabling TV and media newsgathering, sports coverage and similar live events with a simple single off-the-shelf 5G modem. Results of this paper, which are based on real testbeds, shed light on potential weaknesses in the effort of delivering a reliable professional live UL video transmission in field production utilizing a single 5G modem. On the other hand, the tested bonding technique that uses multiple 5G modems for UL video transmission, enhances the 5G Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) rather than exhausting each of them. Bonding technique is a key enabler for live news and live sports productions, resulting not only in increased UL rate, but also in stability and reliability as shown in this work. Several additional insights are touched upon in this work, about the benefit in Time Division Duplexing (TDD) UL pattern, 5G SA UL when bonded with its 4G network and more. © 2022 IEEE.","Altman B., Rahav R., Vordonis D., Giannopoulos D., Papaioannou P., Tranoris C., Denazis S., Desirello D., Vignaroli L.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/MeditCom55741.2022.9928690,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142276036&doi=10.1109%2fMeditCom55741.2022.9928690&partnerID=40&md5=95b3e952b3159777714eb87dc2b2bafc
Pruned Autoencoder based mmWave Channel Estimation in RIS-Assisted Wireless Networks,"Accurate channel estimation is an essential factor in determining the efficiency of a wireless communication system. Moreover, in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces(RIS)-Assisted wireless networks using millimeter wave (mmWave), it is crucial to optimize each RIS element's phase shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a channel estimation method in TDD-based wireless communication system using auto encoder in RIS-Assisted wireless networks. The trade-off relationship between channel estimation accuracy and the number of pilot signals is optimized when performing channel estimation. Through denoising autoencoder and Average Percentage of Zeros(APoZ), we find the optimal pilot pattern considering not only the number of pilots but also the location. As a result of the experiment, the proposed method has little difference in performance or outperforms the full neural network without pruning. © 2022 IEICE.","Kim K., Hong C.S.",2022,Scopus,10.23919/APNOMS56106.2022.9919942,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142086471&doi=10.23919%2fAPNOMS56106.2022.9919942&partnerID=40&md5=27ee5463b3fc79e4251028c667391ff9
Method of 5G TDD Midhaul Multiplexing Gain Estimation based on System-Level Traffic Measurements,"Cloud Radio Access Network (Cloud RAN) was introduced to reduce network cost and increase system flexibility. Due to the split of baseband functions between Distributed (DU) and Centralized Units (CU) the F1 interface has been defined, creating a new domain for transport access networks - midhaul. In this paper, we estimate the statistical multiplexing gain (MG) of traffic aggregation from different DUs on midhaul link. Results of the evaluation can be deployed in Cloud RAN dimensioning system used in the network planning process. Midhaul transport links must provide sufficient capacity and Quality of Service (QoS) to enable required radio performance. To understand the QoS requirement (temporal values of throughputs) of the radio interface and traffic profile patterns, the system level simulator has been used during the study. To enable scaling of simulation results (from 21 to 200 or more cells network) or use other traffic measurements, we have defined a method that is based on a bootstrap methodology. Results show that an optimal point between D U and CU to place an aggregation point is where it could aggregate traffic from 20-40 cells. This method enables reduction of the computational time from several days to several seconds, which is significant for network dimensioning recommendation and in turn for efficiency and elasticity of the service delivered to the telecommunication operators. © 2022 University of Split, FESB.","Dulas D., Maraj-Zygmat K., Walkowiak K.",2022,Scopus,10.23919/SoftCOM55329.2022.9911430,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141550659&doi=10.23919%2fSoftCOM55329.2022.9911430&partnerID=40&md5=7b13711f27aa7b4323aa10432ce6bf37

Generating Class-Level Integration Tests Using Call Site Information,"Search-based approaches have been used in the literature to automate the process of creating unit test cases. However, related work has shown that generated tests with high code coverage could be ineffective, i.e., they may not detect all faults or kill all injected mutants. In this paper, we propose <sc>Cling</sc> , an integration-level test case generation approach that exploits how a pair of classes, the caller and the callee, interact with each other through method calls. In particular, <sc>Cling</sc> generates integration-level test cases that maximize the Coupled Branches Criterion (CBC). Coupled branches are pairs of branches containing a branch of the caller and a branch of the callee such that an integration test that exercises the former also exercises the latter. CBC is a novel integration-level coverage criterion, measuring the degree to which a test suite exercises the interactions between a caller and its callee classes. We implemented <sc>Cling</sc> and evaluated the approach on 140 pairs of classes from five different open-source Java projects. Our results show that (1) <sc>Cling</sc> generates test suites with high CBC coverage, thanks to the definition of the test suite generation as a many-objectives problem where each couple of branches is an independent objective; (2) such generated suites trigger different class interactions and can kill on average 7.7&#x0025; (with a maximum of 50&#x0025;) of mutants that are not detected by tests generated randomly or at the unit level; (3) <sc>Cling</sc> can detect integration faults coming from wrong assumptions about the usage of the callee class (25 for our subject systems) that remain undetected when using automatically generated random and unit-level test suites.

Efficient Approximation of Action Potentials with High-Order Shape Preservation in Unsupervised Spike Sorting,"This paper presents a novel approximation unit added to the conventional spike processing chain which provides an appreciable reduction of complexity of the high-hardware cost feature extractors. The use of the Taylor polynomial is proposed and modelled employing its cascaded derivatives to non-uniformly capture the essential samples in each spike for reliable feature extraction and sorting. Inclusion of the approximation unit can provide 3X compression (i.e. from 66 to 22 samples) to the spike waveforms while preserving their shapes. Detailed spike waveform sequences based on in-vivo measurements have been generated using a customized neural simulator for performance assessment of the approximation unit tested on six published feature extractors. For noise levels σN between 0.05 and 0.3 and groups of 3 spikes in each channel, all the feature extractors provide almost same sorting performance before and after approximation. The overall implementation cost when including the approximation unit and feature extraction shows a large reduction (i.e. up to 8.7X) in the hardware costly and more accurate feature extractors, offering a substantial improvement in feature extraction design. © 2022 IEEE.","Zamani M., Okreghe C., Demosthenous A.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871487,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138127406&doi=10.1109%2fEMBC48229.2022.9871487&partnerID=40&md5=37fd5db6990c8a4edffa28c7eb039d5f

This changes the work pattern of the people who are required to carry out all online-based activities, including the implementation of seminars or conferences. The amount of training and socialization carried out by webinars requires a good webinar management system. The purpose of this paper is to develop a web-based information system for webinar activity management under the name webiplan. The method used in system development is the waterfall method. In the waterfall method, there are 5 stages, including requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance. The subjects of this research are prospective end users of the system, namely lecturers and students who are accustomed to participating in webinars. The design and development stages are tailored to the user's needs obtained in the previous phase and are described as product backlog items. At the verification stage, three stages are used to evaluate the feasibility level of the information system, including: unit testing using whitebox testing, validation testing using the blackbox testing method, and compatibility testing. The results of whitebox testing and blackbox testing showed that every feature and user task could run well so as to provide convenience for the organizers and participants in the implementation of the webinar.

Removing Decorator to Improve Energy Efficiency,"With growing concerns regarding climate change and rising energy costs, there is an increased focus on improving the energy efficiency of software. One relevant avenue of research is the transformation of software designs in order to increase efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Design Patterns are of interest here as the indirection they introduce is likely to have a detrimental effect on energy consumption. In this paper we report on our investigations into the impact on energy consumption of the Decorator pattern, which is a structural design pattern used to enable additional behaviour to be attached to an individual component dynamically. Application of this pattern improves the maintainability of software at the cost of increased indirection and redundancy, which may reduce energy efficiency. In this paper we explore features of the Decorator pattern that impact on its systematic removal, with a future goal of removing this pattern using automated refactoring. We subsequently examine experimentally the Decorator pattern's impact on energy consumption in Java and find its implementation results in an increased number of instantiated objects and method invocations at run-time. The removal of the pattern can result in up to a 96% reduction in energy consumption in a best-case scenario with a textbook example, and up to a 5% reduction in energy consumption in an open-source project with a case study examining JUnit, a popular unit testing framework for Java. These results demonstrate the energy savings achievable with the removal of Decorator pattern instances and open the way for similar investigations of other design patterns. © 2022 IEEE.","Bree D.C., Cinneide M.O.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00108,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135781876&doi=10.1109%2fSANER53432.2022.00108&partnerID=40&md5=c8605dc6f863fff1f7601b2626b31c65
Computer Vision-Based Detection and Recognition Model of Objects for any Autonomous Systems in Low Illumination Condition,"The theories and methods it studies have received extensive attention in many disciplines and fields, promoting the development of artificial intelligence systems and expanding the possibilities of computer applications. Image processing is an important field of pattern recognition methods. The widely used character recognition (OCR) is a typicalapplication of pattern recognition in image processing. The pattern recognition process can be seen as a mapping process from the sample space to the category space. If you divide an n-dimensional feature space with n features asparameters into different regions, each region corresponds to a class of pattern classes. Among them, feature selection and extraction is an important part of pattern recognition. Ifthe selected features can fully reflect the essential features of the class, the classifier is easier to design. According to the presence or absence of standard samples, pattern recognition can be divided into surveillance identification methods and non-supervisory identification methods. The supervisory identification method is to design a classifierunder the condition that the class to which the training sample belongs is known, and the method for recognizing the sample is performed by the classifier. © 2022 IEEE.","Ashok P., Kavinilavu A., Ananthi S., Suganthi P., Iniyan E.U.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/ICACITE53722.2022.9823533,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135451798&doi=10.1109%2fICACITE53722.2022.9823533&partnerID=40&md5=9a81c9e2495902da70b7a09b73320d81

Leveraging Code-Test Co-evolution Patterns for Automated Test Case Recommendation,"Context: Prior research revealed that code components with similar structures tend to require structurally similar test cases and they often co-evolve over time. Objective: Leveraging this pattern, we implemented a prototype tool, Test Suite Evolver (TSE), to support the generation of test cases for structurally similar methods. Our prototype tool is applicable to both, incomplete test suites with the purpose of test case augmentation, as well as evolving test suites when a newer version of a software becomes available. Method: Making use of the aforementioned code-test co-evolution pattern, TSE leverages source code structural similarity and a set of existing test cases to synthesise and recommend new unit tests. For this, TSE initially identifies groups of structurally similar methods in the code, determines changes at the token-level, and integrates the retrieved information to synthesise updated test cases. Results: Our evaluations indicated that 38% of the source code of five large open-source applications consist of methods which are structurally similar to each other and therefore for which, the co-evolution pattern holds. Applying TSE to these methods, TSE generated 72% of the minimum required test cases with only 11% token-based edit distance between the generated test cases and those written by developers. To evaluate the test cases' validity, we used code2vec, a neural network to measure the structural and semantic similarity between the generated and developed test cases. The results indicated that TSE successfully generated test cases with a similarity measure of more than 80% in more than 95.6% of test cases and similarity measure of 100% for 88.35% of the test cases. Conclusion: The evaluations revealed that TSE is able to generate the majority of the necessary test cases with an insignificant amount of modifications required from the developers.

Cardiac crises: Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy during TANGO2 deficiency related metabolic crises,"Background: TANGO2 deficiency disorder (TDD) is an autosomal recessive disease associated with metabolic crisis, lethal cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy. Data regarding treatment, management, and outcomes of cardiac manifestations of TDD are lacking. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe TDD-related cardiac crises. Methods: Retrospective multicenter chart review was made of TDD patients admitted with cardiac crises, defined as development of ventricular tachycardia (VT), cardiomyopathy, or cardiac arrest during metabolic crises. Results: Twenty-seven children were admitted for 43 cardiac crises (median age 6.4 years; interquartile range [IQR] 2.4–9.8 years) at 14 centers. During crisis, QTc prolongation occurred in all (median 547 ms; IQR 504–600 ms) and a type I Brugada pattern in 8 (26%). Arrhythmias included VT in 21 (78%), supraventricular tachycardia in 3 (11%), and heart block in 1 (4%). Nineteen patients (70%) developed cardiomyopathy, and 20 (74%) experienced a cardiac arrest. There were 10 deaths (37%), 6 related to arrhythmias. In 5 patients, recalcitrant VT occurred despite use of antiarrhythmic drugs. In 6 patients, arrhythmias were controlled after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support; 5 of these patients survived. Among 10 patients who survived VT without ECMO, successful treatment included intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, and atrial pacing in multiple cases and verapamil in 1 patient. Initiation of feeds seemed to decrease VT events. Conclusion: TDD-related cardiac crises are associated with a high risk of arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and death. Although further studies are needed, early recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Acutely, intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, atrial pacing, and ECMO as a last resort seem to be the best current treatment options, and early initiation of feeds may prevent VT events. © 2022","Miyake C.Y., Lay E.J., Beach C.M., Ceresnak S.R., Delauz C.M., Howard T.S., Janson C.M., Jardine K., Kannankeril P.J., Kava M., Kim J.J., Liberman L., Macicek S.L., Pham T.D., Robertson T., Valdes S.O., Webster G., Stephens S.B., Milewicz D.M., Azamian M., Ehsan S.A., Houck K.M., Soler-Alfonso C., Glinton K.E., Tosur M., Li N., Xu W., Lalani S.R., Zhang L.",2022,Scopus,10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.05.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132898816&doi=10.1016%2fj.hrthm.2022.05.009&partnerID=40&md5=763dfcb870f8bda8455b7d2aa210b4b6
Students vs. Professionals: Improving the Learning of Software Testing,"Software testing is a crucial phase of software development. Educators now are assessing tests written by students. Methods have been proposed to assess the completeness of student-written tests. However, there is more to good test quality than completeness, and these additional quality are not assessed by the previous work. Test smells are patterns of poorly designed tests that may negatively affect the quality of test and production code. We propose to assess test smells in students' code to improve the quality of software tests they write. In the early stages of this research, we will examine whether practitioners actually spend time and energy to remove those test smells summarized by researchers backed by real-world software projects. Then, we will develop and evaluate our new assessment method. © 2022 IEEE.",Chen Z.,2022,Scopus,10.1109/ICSE-Companion55297.2022.9793734,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132418460&doi=10.1109%2fICSE-Companion55297.2022.9793734&partnerID=40&md5=1ad43b0c7130f50e3de466d00cc0606e
Towards unit testing of event-driven control requirements [На пути к модульному тестированию событийно-управляемых требований],"Testing is a generally accepted method to control software quality, although it is not completely reliable. Nevertheless, this method integrates extremely well into development environments and continuous integration practices. In this paper, we briefly review the behavioral patterns that we have previously developed for the logical description of the programmable logic controllers (PLC) operations using tabular properties. We also present a diagram for the checking algorithm of a bounded model to investigate the feasibility of such properties. We describe how to implement the terms and formulas that provide the behavior patterns of PLC programs in an object-oriented programming language (C++ in this case). After the black box assessment for the values of the control variables for inputs and outputs of the system has been set, we show how convenient it is to describe the requirements in the form of our instantiated classes. This description allows integrating the unit testing process for the checking requirements of the PLC programs. © 2022 by the authors.","Staroletov S.M., Anureev I.S.",2022,Scopus,10.25743/ICT.2022.27.1.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130138625&doi=10.25743%2fICT.2022.27.1.007&partnerID=40&md5=0f3204b5e8e91c5d36750fd5095b8b82
Trustworthy Dynamic Data Awareness Model for Tracking in CPS,"With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), the interconnected devices and sensors in cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasing; these continuously exchange collected data for revealing helpful information about the overall system. In CPS-based monitoring applications, abnormal (including anomalies/outliers) values can lead to severe consequences for skewed judgments. The criteria for determining abnormal values may change over time, making it impossible to detect abnormal in real-time based on a training model or rely on traditional statistical methods to find abnormal values efficiently. When machine learning using, abnormal values in the data set are considered data errors or noise and excluded from analysis for the stability of the results. However, the identified abnormal values contain essential information in some cases, making correct navigation and identifying anomalies even more critical. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Dynamic Data-Awareness (TDD-Awareness) algorithm that extracts the characteristics of continuous sensor data and accurately identifies abnormal values through the subsequent preprocessing process. The TDD-Awareness algorithm extracts the number of generated abnormally, the time of occurrence, and the characteristics and patterns needed to analyze the location of occurrence from the sensor data. The importance of “abnormal values” is determined by effectively exploring the relationship between abnormally to separate containing necessary information. © 2022","Kim S., Kim S., Yoon Y.",2022,Scopus,10.22967/HCIS.2022.12.013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129370944&doi=10.22967%2fHCIS.2022.12.013&partnerID=40&md5=421e13f0902301ae385b6d87b5449154
Integrating TDD Communication and Radar Sensing in Co-Located Planar Array: A Genetic Algorithm Enabled Aperture Design,"In this paper, we design interleaved transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) apertures co-located in one planar array for enabling joint communication and sensing. A fixed number of antennas in a rectangular configuration is allocable for the apertures, and we use a genetic algorithm to determine the allocation. We assume that the Tx aperture transmits one beam to an active communication user (downlink communication of time division duplex) and another beam for sensing the passive target, and the Rx aperture receives backscattered sensing signals simultaneously (full duplex). The array apertures' design criteria are based on the effect of interference mitigation when using linear beamforming. The optimal solution is determined when the side lobes for the beams are minimized at different scanning angles in the field of view. Our numerical results indicate that the near-optimal antenna allocation for the apertures does not perform uniformly for all desired beam directions, but yet, we could conclude a near-optimal solution based on the least discrepancy between the sidelobe suppression effects for the aperture patterns. © 2022 IEEE.","Alidoustaghdam H., Miao Y., Kokkeler A.",2022,Scopus,10.1109/JCS54387.2022.9743500,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128668742&doi=10.1109%2fJCS54387.2022.9743500&partnerID=40&md5=54bd665494788cbeca9ec866cdc0cdbb
A proposed formulation for multi-objective renewable economic load dispatch,"The economic development, rising global temperatures, urbanization, and rapid population increase are some prominent factors that have resulted in increased electricity demand worldwide. The burning of fossil fuels to meet the industrial electricity demand is leading to deleterious environmental effects. Economic load dispatch (ELD) is an optimization problem that determines an optimum way in terms of cost-effectiveness and emission minimization, for generating power by utilizing the electricity generation resources. Global climatic concerns are driving the researchers to spread the scope of ELD and include unconventional and renewable sources. This research work proposes a combination of three major renewable energy sources with thermal power sources (solar, wind and hydro). The proposed objective function includes a large number of major constraints related to each of the included sources which have not been combined before. The pattern search algorithm has been implemented on IEEE 40 unit test system combining wind, solar and hydro power generating units to observe the results. The results are also compared with the 140 unit Korean power generation model and in addition to several similar systems. Simulation results show that the problem formulation and inclusion of respective constraints bring authenticity to the system and produce accurate results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Mir J., Kasim S., Mahdin H., Saedudin R.R., Hassan R., Ramlan R.",2022,Scopus,10.1007/s12652-021-03691-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124356661&doi=10.1007%2fs12652-021-03691-y&partnerID=40&md5=82bddb160bd419a0dd096a62af07db6d
How do i refactor this? An empirical study on refactoring trends and topics in Stack Overflow,"An essential part of software maintenance and evolution, refactoring is performed by developers, regardless of technology or domain, to improve the internal quality of the system, and reduce its technical debt. However, choosing the appropriate refactoring strategy is not always straightforward, resulting in developers seeking assistance. Although research in refactoring is well-established, with several studies altering between the detection of refactoring opportunities and the recommendation of appropriate code changes, little is known about their adoption in practice. Analyzing the perception of developers is critical to understand better what developers consider to be problematic in their code and how they handle it. Additionally, there is a need for bridging the gap between refactoring, as research, and its adoption in practice, by extracting common refactoring intents that are more suitable for what developers face in reality. In this study, we analyze refactoring discussions on Stack Overflow through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our results show that Stack Overflow is utilized by a diverse set of developers for refactoring assistance for a variety of technologies. Our observations show five areas that developers typically require help with refactoring– Code Optimization, Tools and IDEs, Architecture and Design Patterns, Unit Testing, and Database. We envision our findings better bridge the support between traditional (or academic) aspects of refactoring and their real-world applicability, including better tool support. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Peruma A., Simmons S., AlOmar E.A., Newman C.D., Mkaouer M.W., Ouni A.",2022,Scopus,10.1007/s10664-021-10045-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117733907&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-021-10045-x&partnerID=40&md5=08aa5a74f13d392f5792c4911475ef97
On Channel Estimation of Uplink TDD Massive MIMO Systems Through Different Pilot Structures,"This work is considered as a comparative study in which the quality of channel estimation (CE) in massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) systems is studied by operating at Uplink (UL) phase according to a time division duplex (TDD) scheme using commonly known channel estimators existing in the literature. The least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimators are investigated with three categories of pilots, namely regular pilots (RPs), time-superimposed (or superimposed ) pilots and staggered pilots (StP). Two patterns of frequency reuse (FR) per category are used. The simulation results showed that by increasing the number of BS antennas with a fixed number of symbols dedicated to the UL phase and vice versa, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the LS and MMSE estimators using the superimposed pilot (SuP) or StP is asymptotically approaches the NMSE of the LS and MMSE estimators using the RP, respectively. An asymptotic behavior is studied for two different FR scenarios. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Amadid J., Boulouird M., Riadi A., Hassani M.M.’R.",2022,Scopus,10.1007/978-981-16-3637-0_12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116853776&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-3637-0_12&partnerID=40&md5=14326890aa320dc64219746fff0fd5a4
Efficient Dislocation Prevention and Thermal Transport Network Constructed by CNT Films on PSS for GaN-Based UV LEDs,"We report the realization of a dislocation prevention and thermal transport network by adopting carbon nanotube (CNT) films on a commercially available patterned sapphire substrate (PSS), using which a high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) epilayer and a device with improved thermal performance are achieved at the same time. High fill factor CNT films with easy accessibility are lifted above the sapphire patterns and introduce a second selective area growth subsequent to the micron-scale selective area growth on PSS, leading to a further reduction in threading dislocation density (TDD) without involving any regrowth process. Under this dislocation prevention effect, the TDD of the GaN epilayer dropped to 3.5 × 107 cm-2 consequently, which is 78% lower than that on PSS. A thermal transporting network of CNTs with high axial thermal conductivity is simultaneously established, contributing to the great improvement in the thermal performance of the near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (LED) fabricated subsequently. As a result, an 89% increase in saturation light output power and a 55.5% enhancement in internal quantum efficiency were acquired. We thus believe that this convenient yet effective method will be a competitive solution for short-wavelength LED devices that require high efficiency and long lifetime. ©","Wang K., Tian Y., Li M., Zhang H., Chen Z., Wei Y., Yu T.",2021,Scopus,10.1021/acsaelm.1c00736,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118760932&doi=10.1021%2facsaelm.1c00736&partnerID=40&md5=84a3a36857714cb18b0c90cd53e4e4aa
"Correction: Kirste et al. Structural analysis of low defect ammonothermally grown GaN wafers by borrmann effect X-ray topography (Materials, (2021), 14, (5472), 10.3390/ma14195472)","The Materials Editorial Office would like to make the following change to this paper [1]. 1. On page 3: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces needed to be changed. The notation has been corrected in the following paragraphs: “They are overgrown in the lateral 〈1120〉 directions during many crystallization processes (due to the slender shape of the seed sticks mainly in the [1120] and [1120] directions). After reaching the desired lateral size, the crystals are joined in pairs by tiling in order to obtain a larger crystal. To multiply lateral overgrowth and tiling requires continuous mechanical processing of the crystals in the stage of their preparation for a given growth run. The crystals are mainly trimmed and lapped in a proper way. Figure 1 represents a scheme of the multi regrowth of a slender GaN seed and a scheme of combining two newly-grown, already separated from their seeds, crystals by tiling technology. When the combined crystals reach the correct size by growth in the lateral 〈1120〉 as well as the vertical [0001] crystallographic directions (growth in the latter direction is not marked), they are used for preparing substrates, shown in Figure 1. As already mentioned, then the wafering procedures are applied.” 2. On page 4: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in Figure 1 caption needed to be changed. The notation has been corrected in the caption: “Scheme of the substrate manufacturing steps starting from slender GaN seeds to the finished wafer: Step 1, multi regrowth of a slender GaN seed in the lateral 〈1120〉 directions; three new-grown crystal areas crystallized in three separated processes are marked; Step 2, new crystal sliced from the overgrown seed of Step 1; Step 3, two cut out crystals are joined together by tiling technology; Step 4, GaN continues to grow in the lateral 〈1120〉 directions as well as in vertical [0001] direction in multi regrowth steps; Step 5, when the necessary size is reached the as-grown GaN crystals can be drilled, sliced and polished in a proper way to produce wafers.” 3. On page 6: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence “The bars are perpendicular to one of the fastest growth directions, e.g., the (1120) direction and its opposite direction (1120), but initially not to the four symmetrically equivalent (2110), (2110), (1210) and (1210)” should be “The bars are perpendicular to one of the fastest growth directions, e.g., the [1120] directions and its opposite direction [1120], but initially not to the four symmetrically equivalent [2110], [2110], [1210] and [1210]”. The (1120) in the following sentence has been corrected: “While in the first seed enlargement steps growth was limited to only two directions, in the later course seed enlargement typically occurred in all type 〈1120〉 directions and areas with ultra-low TDD emerged at the wafer edge in all these six possible directions.” 4. On page 7: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “In the case of substrate B, six lines of contrast running parallel to the [1100] direction are observed. Four of the contrast lines appear bright and two of the contrast lines appear dark. This effect is caused by a slight bending of the basal plane at the tiling seam as it forms a grain boundary. The overall pattern of line structures can be described as chains of threading dislocation bundles. The main course in the depth of the dislocation bundles is along the 〈0001〉 direction.” has been corrected. On page 8: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the end of this defect pattern is limited in the [1120] and [1120] direction by areas that were formed in a subsequent generation of the crystal growth process.” has been corrected. On page 10: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “The growth front of the Am-GaN crystal proceeded from right to left in [1120] direction.” has been corrected. The notation in the sentence: “It should be kept in mind that not only in the lateral direction, but also in the vertical [0001] growth direction, phenomena such as growth bands and striations are typically present in ammonothermally grown GaN due to the regrowth steps, as was already shown by Sintonen et al. [39]. Another observation that can be made in the section of the two topographs (Figure 9) is that TDD gradually decreases in the lateral [1120] growth direction; to the right of the growth band TDD is the highest, in the growth band area itself there is a medium TDD and to the left of the growth band TDD is lowest.” has also been corrected. On page 11: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentences: “These dislocations appear like a network forming a continuous wall that extends perpendicularly to the [1210].”; “Again, as with the example before (Figure 9), separated areas of distinct TDD can be observed for the different lateral regrowth areas with the lowest TDD in the regrowth area at the outer edge in the [1210] direction”; and “The DB chains always run along an a-plane {1120} growth facet.” has been corrected. On page 12: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “The outer edges of the hexagons always run along the a-plane {1120} prismatic facets and these clusters can reach the size of more than 1 mm edge length for the wafers investigated here (and more than 2 mm edge length for substrates examined in other studies).” has been corrected. On page 13: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “The single and chain-like DBs are defects that are manifested in the growth steps of seed crystal enlargement and always arrange themselves along a-plane {1120} facets. It is shown that these DBs arise not only at the interface between two regions of different regrowth steps (as in the example of a DB chain visible in Figure 12b), but they also can arise suddenly in the middle of a seed enlargement growth phase (as in all examples shown for single DBs (Figure 11) and the DB chain of Figure 12b). The formation point of the DBs with honeycomb structure (Figure 13) is currently less clear. It could be during the growth for seed crystal enlargement along a-plane {1120} facets or at the growth in the vertical [0001] directions.” has been corrected. On page 15: The notation of crystallographic crystal directions and crystal faces in the sentence: “It should be remarked that a 1–2 orders of magnitude lower TD is found in the most recent grown areas in the lateral 〈1120〉 direction.” has been corrected.

Medial entorhinal cortex lesions produce delay-dependent disruptions in memory for elapsed time,"Our memory for time is a fundamental ability that we use to judge the duration of events, put our experiences into a temporal context, and decide when to initiate actions. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), with its direct projections to the hippocampus, has been proposed to be the key source of temporal information for hippocampal time cells. However, the behavioral relevance of such temporal firing patterns remains unclear, as most of the paradigms used for the study of temporal processing and time cells are either spatial tasks or tasks for which MEC function is not required. In this study, we asked whether the MEC is necessary for rats to perform a time duration discrimination task (TDD), in which rats were trained to discriminate between 10-s and 20-s delay intervals. After reaching a 90% performance criterion, the rats were assigned to receive an excitotoxic MEC-lesion or sham-lesion surgery. We found that after recovering from surgery, rats with MEC lesions were impaired on the TDD task in comparison to rats with sham lesions, failing to return to criterion performance. Their impairment, however, was specific to the longer, 20-s delay trials. These results indicate that time processing is dependent on MEC neural computations only for delays that exceed 10 s, perhaps because long-term memory resources are needed to keep track of longer time intervals. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Vo A., Tabrizi N.S., Hunt T., Cayanan K., Chitale S., Anderson L.G., Tenney S., White A.O., Sabariego M., Hales J.B.",2021,Scopus,10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107507,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114186362&doi=10.1016%2fj.nlm.2021.107507&partnerID=40&md5=586b9fed33d0cd45a220f6d65675de33
High-resolution and scalable printing of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS for printable electronics,"Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a primary candidate for the conductive material in printable electronics. Currently, lateral resolutions down to only 30 μm have been demonstrated for roll-to-roll (R2R)-compatible PEDOT:PSS printing. However, increasing lateral resolution of the printing technique can increase the complexity/ability of printed devices. Topographical discontinuous dewetting (TDD) and liquid-bridge transfer (LBT) is employed as a high-resolution, scalable, R2R-compatible patterning technique to fabricate PEDOT:PSS patterns with down to 400 nm lateral resolution and high thicknesses. PEDOT:PSS ink dispersions were prepared with water/ethanol/cosolvent mixtures to enable the TDD process and ensure high conductivity. After transfer by LBT to target substrates, an impressive average conductivity of 20.5 S cm-1 was measured for the transferred PEDOT:PSS patterns without any post-transfer conductivity-enhancing treatments. Post-transfer conductivity-enhancing treatments were applied that are device fabrication-compatible (acid-free) with very high conductivities up to ∼2590 S cm-1 and average conductivity of ∼1190 S cm-1 for PEDOT:PSS lines patterns fabricated with 4.3% dimethylformamide (DMF) cosolvent. Interestingly, DMF cosolvent in the PEDOT:PSS ink dispersion formed higher conductivity line patterns due to different drying dynamics. This work demonstrates a path to achieve high-resolution, scalable, R2R-compatible printing of PEDOT:PSS patterns while maintaining very high conductivities for future advanced printable electronic devices.

Effect of MOVPE growth conditions on AlN films on annealed sputtered AlN templates with nano-striped patterns,"The metalorganic vapor phase epitaxial (MOVPE) growth of AlN films was performed on face-to-face annealed sputtered AlN templates (FFA Sp-AlN) having a nano-striped pattern with a period of 300 nm and depth of 120 nm. Then, the effect of MOVPE growth conditions on the crystallinity was elucidated. The faceted structure clearly changed with the growth temperature (Tg), following the same trend as the epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN film on micro-patterned GaN. High Tg levels enhanced the lateral growth, and thus with a high Tg of 1300 °C, the coalescence in the early growth stage resulted in AlN films with coalesced surfaces and a thickness of 1 µm. For the AlN film grown at a Tg of 1300 °C, the threading dislocation density (TDD) was estimated to be 6.0 × 108 cm−2. This value proved that coalesced AlN films on nano-patterned FFA Sp-AlN templates with low TDDs could be achieved with the appropriate MOVPE growth conditions. The compressive strain in the AlN film on nano-patterned FFA Sp-AlN was lower than that of the film grown on FFA Sp-AlN without a pattern. © 2021","Iba Y., Shojiki K., Kuboya S., Uesugi K., Xiao S., Miyake H.",2021,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2021.126237,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109439856&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcrysgro.2021.126237&partnerID=40&md5=e8b9b783d565489e22b4cb4c6711b2c0
Seasonal Patterns in Daily Flight Distance and Space Use by Great Egrets (Ardea alba),"In an effort to quantify the value of wetland habitats, GPS technology was used to document the movement patterns of 16 Great Egrets (Ardea alba) in North America. Patterns in daily flight distances and utilization distributions (UD; estimates of area occupied on the ground) were documented throughout the annual cycle. Maximum Daily Displacement (MDD), the farthest distance occupied by a bird from colony/roost (central place) in 24 hr was greatest (4.3 ± 0.1 km) during breeding season and lowest (3.3 ± 0.1) during post-breeding season. As birds visited multiple foraging sites and made multiple round trips to central places, this Total Daily Distance (TDD) was also measured. It increased from a mean of about 12 km during the incubation phase to about 35 km at the time of fledging. Average TDD was greatest during breeding season (14.2 ± 0.3 km) and lowest during winter (11.0 ± 0.2 km).

Developer's Perspectives on Unit Test Cases Understandability,"Good unit testing plays the most important role when it comes to driving and evaluating software quality. However, writing effective tests is a very expensive and time-consuming practice. To reduce such load on developers, there are many different techniques for automatically generating test suites for an existing source code. However, how automatically generated test cases compare to manually written cases is an open research question. There are some understandability issues regarding autogenerated test cases. This paper presents an experiment based on A/B testing methodology to gather developer preferences at test cases presentation. This survey involved 44 developers from 17 country. It founds that majority developers prefer the manual written than automatic generated test cases. This result brings some new perspectives to improve the quality of the automatic generated test case. © 2021 IEEE.","Setiani N., Ferdiana R., Hartanto R.",2021,Scopus,10.1109/ICSESS52187.2021.9522166,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114962080&doi=10.1109%2fICSESS52187.2021.9522166&partnerID=40&md5=8f9ed5f41797d7c6b3201efa2bc88bbf

"Plant diversity, structure and regeneration potential in tropical forests of Western Ghats, India","Diversity, stand structure and regeneration potential are the key elements of any forest ecosystem. For the present study, seven sites were selected with the aims of assessing plant diversity, structure and regeneration potential in tropical forests across Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS), Western Ghats, India. The sites were classified based on the similarity: tropical dry deciduous sites (TDDs I and II), tropical semi-evergreen sites (TSEs I and II) and tropical evergreen sites (TEFs I-III). The phytosociological survey was done by laying a total of 70 plots (10 plots in each study site). Standard methods were followed for the assessment of diversity, structure and regeneration patterns. A total of 267 species (205 genera, 70 families) were recorded. The tree species richness ranged 24 (TDD II) - 76 (TEF III). Of the vegetation spectrum, trees, vines and understorey accounted 56.5, 15.3 and 28.2% respectively to the total flora documented. A total of 66 species were endemic. The total tree density and tree basal area (seedlings, saplings, juveniles and adults) were 18,790 individuals (mean 2684) and 137.6 m2 (mean 19.7 m2) in 70 plots respectively. The mean tree adult density and basal area ranged 370 (TDD I) - 900 (TEF I) individuals/ha and 24.2 (TDD I) - 75.3 (TEF III) m2/ha respectively. The overall species richness was highest in TDD I, but TEF III had the highest tree species richness. The diameter class-wise distribution showed the characteristic 'reverse J-shaped' curve. Most tree species were 'newly recruited'. The dominant species had 'fair' to 'good' regeneration potential. However, 12 tree species showed 'no' regeneration. The overall regeneration pattern of trees was 'good', but 'no' or 'poor' regeneration patterns in some tree species, especially endemics is a point of concern. Since a majority of tree species were 'new recruits', species composition may likely change in the future. The results obtained would help in understanding diversity patterns, structural attributes and regeneration potential in tropical forests of protected areas for better forest management and conservation. © 2020 Ecological Society of China.

Unit and regression tests of scientific software: A study on SWMM,"Testing helps assure software quality by executing a program and uncovering bugs. Scientific software developers often find it challenging to carry out systematic and automated testing due to reasons like inherent model uncertainties and complex floating-point computations. Extending the recent work on analyzing the unit tests written by the developers of the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) [32], we report in this paper the investigation of both unit and regression tests of SWMM. The results show that the 2953 unit tests of SWMM have a 39.7% statement-level code coverage and a 82.4% user manual coverage. Meanwhile, an examination of 58 regression tests of SWMM shows a 44.9% statement-level code coverage and a near 100% user manual coverage. We also observe a “getter-setter-getter” testing pattern from the SWMM unit tests, and suggest a diversified way of executing regression tests. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Peng Z., Lin X., Simon M., Niu N.",2021,Scopus,10.1016/j.jocs.2021.101347,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104071997&doi=10.1016%2fj.jocs.2021.101347&partnerID=40&md5=d9b772ece86a90c03d848f6b85ecbf3a
DriverSeekers - A mobile designated driver services system,"The intention of this project is to determine the limitations of the current market needs where the road injuries and fatalities are a growing concern in Malaysia. Without any hesitation, the resident's driving pattern and behavior are highly correlated. Hence, the objective of this study is to develop a prototype mobile application DriverSeekers for pairing drivers with users who do not wish or do not have the ability to drive their own vehicles.

Strain modulation of selectively and/or globally grown ge layers,"This article presents a novel method to grow a high-quality compressive-strain Ge epilayer on Si using the selective epitaxial growth (SEG) applying the RPCVD technique. The procedures are composed of a global growth of Ge layer on Si followed by a planarization using CMP as initial process steps. The growth parameters of the Ge layer were carefully optimized and after cycle-annealing treatments, the threading dislocation density (TDD) was reduced to 3 × 107 cm−2 . As a result of this process, a tensile strain of 0.25% was induced, whereas the RMS value was as low as 0.81 nm. Later, these substrates were covered by an oxide layer and patterned to create trenches for selective epitaxy growth (SEG) of the Ge layer. In these structures, a type of compressive strain was formed in the SEG Ge top layer. The strain amount was −0.34%; meanwhile, the TDD and RMS surface roughness were 2 × 106 cm−2 and 0.68 nm, respectively. HRXRD and TEM results also verified the existence of compressive strain in selectively grown Ge layer. In contrast to the tensile strained Ge layer (globally grown), enhanced PL intensity by a factor of more than 2 is partially due to the improved material quality. The significantly high PL intensity is attributed to the improved crystalline quality of the selectively grown Ge layer. The change in direct bandgap energy of PL was observed, owing to the compressive strain introduced. Hall measurement shows that a selectively grown Ge layer possesses room temperature hole mobility up to 375 cm2/Vs, which is approximately 3 times larger than that of the Ge (132 cm2/Vs). Our work offers fundamental guidance for the growth of high-quality and compressive strain Ge epilayer on Si for future Ge-based optoelectronics integration applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Automatic unit test generation for machine learning libraries: How far are we?,"Automatic unit test generation that explores the input space and produces effective test cases for given programs have been studied for decades. Many unit test generation tools that can help generate unit test cases with high structural coverage over a program have been examined. However, the fact that existing test generation tools are mainly evaluated on general software programs calls into question about its practical effectiveness and usefulness for machine learning libraries, which are statistically orientated and have fundamentally different nature and construction from general software projects. In this paper, we set out to investigate the effectiveness of existing unit test generation techniques on machine learning libraries. To investigate this issue, we conducted an empirical study on five widely used machine learning libraries with two popular unit testcase generation tools, i.e., EVOSUITE and Randoop. We find that (1) most of the machine learning libraries do not maintain a high-quality unit test suite regarding commonly applied quality metrics such as code coverage (on average is 34.1%) and mutation score (on average is 21.3%), (2) unit test case generation tools, i.e., EVOSUITE and Randoop, lead to clear improvements in code coverage and mutation score, however, the improvement is limited, and (3) there exist common patterns in the uncovered code across the five machine learning libraries that can be used to improve unit test case generation tasks. © 2021 IEEE.","Wang S., Shrestha N., Subburaman A.K., Wang J., Wei M., Nagappan N.",2021,Scopus,10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00138,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115676453&doi=10.1109%2fICSE43902.2021.00138&partnerID=40&md5=b5c922209794d88bc202afaebdc4bed2
What it would take to use mutation testing in industry - A study at facebook,"Traditionally, mutation testing generates an abundance of small deviations of a program, called mutants. At industrial systems the scale and size of Facebook's, doing this is infeasible. We should not create mutants that the test suite would likely fail on or that give no actionable signal to developers. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we semi-automatically learn error-inducing patterns from a corpus of common Java coding errors and from changes that caused operational anomalies at Facebook specifically. We combine the mutations with instrumentation that measures which tests exactly visited the mutated piece of code. Results on more than 15,000 generated mutants show that more than half of the generated mutants survive Facebook's rigorous test suite of unit, integration, and system tests. Moreover, in a case study with 26 developers, all but two expressed that the mutation exposed a lack of testing in principle. As such, almost half of the 26 would actually act on the mutant presented to them by adapting an existing or creating a new test. The others did not for a variety of reasons often outside the scope of mutation testing. It remains a practical challenge how we can include such external information to increase the true actionability rate on mutants. © 2021 IEEE.","Beller M., Wong C.-P., Bader J., Scott A., MacHalica M., Chandra S., Meijer E.",2021,Scopus,10.1109/ICSE-SEIP52600.2021.00036,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106138886&doi=10.1109%2fICSE-SEIP52600.2021.00036&partnerID=40&md5=1ca95d490a8940708570762c32c05ff6
Prioritized test generation guided by software fault prediction,"Writing and running software unit tests is one of the fundamental techniques used to maintain software quality. However, this process is rather costly and time consuming. Thus, much effort has been devoted to generating unit tests automatically. The common objective of test generation algorithms is to maximize code coverage. However, maximizing coverage is not necessarily correlated with identifying faults [1]. In this work, we propose a novel approach for test generation aiming at generating a small set of tests that cover the software components that are likely to contain bugs. To identify which components are more likely to contain bugs, we train a software fault prediction model using machine learning techniques. We implemented this approach in practice in a tool called QUADRANT, and demonstrate its effectiveness on five real-world, open-source projects. Results show the benefit of using QUADRANT, where test generation guided by our fault prediction model can detect more than double the number of bugs compared to a coverage-oriented approach, thereby saving test generation and execution efforts. © 2021 IEEE.","Hershkovich E., Stern R., Abreu R., Elmishali A.",2021,Scopus,10.1109/ICSTW52544.2021.00045,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108023808&doi=10.1109%2fICSTW52544.2021.00045&partnerID=40&md5=b41d3f8e7b864bc919537532e3327523
A method for the automated generating of the code-coverage ensuring input test data based on the control flow analysis,"This paper describes the design and implementation of a method aimed at the automation of the input test data. The method is based on the analysis of the control flow graph of the tested application and should provide an automated way for obtaining input test data that will allow us to systematically cover the program with unit tests. The analysis starts with the tested method parameters and searches the method body to find the relation between the inputs and the conditions that affect the control flow. The control flow graphs are obtained from the Java bytecode, however, the rest of the analysis is performed only on the control flow graph and thus should be platform-independent.

"Application of a Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network in a 3-D Global Electron Density Model Using the Long-Term Observations of COSMIC, Fengyun-3C, and Digisonde","The ionosphere plays an important role in satellite navigation, radio communication, and space weather prediction. However, it is still a challenging mission to develop a model with high predictability that captures the horizontal-vertical features of ionospheric electrodynamics. In this study, multiple observations during 2005–2019 from space-borne global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) systems (COSMIC and FY-3C) and the Digisonde Global Ionosphere Radio Observatory are utilized to develop a completely global ionospheric three-dimensional electron density model based on an artificial neural network, namely ANN-TDD. The correlation coefficients of the predicted profiles all exceed 0.96 for the training, validation and test datasets, and the minimum root-mean-square error of the predicted residuals is 7.8 × 104 el/cm3. Under quiet space weather, the predicted accuracy of the ANN-TDD is 30%–60% higher than the IRI-2016 at the Millstone Hill and Jicamarca incoherent scatter radars. However, the ANN-TDD is less capable of predicting ionospheric dynamic evolution under severe geomagnetic storms compared to the IRI-2016 with the STORM option activated. Additionally, the ANN-TDD successfully reproduces the large-scale horizontal-vertical ionospheric electrodynamic features, including seasonal variation and hemispheric asymmetries. These features agree well with the structure revealed by the RO profiles derived from the FORMOSAT/COSMIC-2 mission. Furthermore, the ANN-TDD successfully captures the prominent regional ionospheric patterns, including the equatorial ionization anomaly, Weddell Sea anomaly and mid-latitude summer nighttime anomaly. The new model is expected to play an important role in the application of GNSS navigation and in the explanation of the physical mechanisms involved. © 2021.

Analysis of an automatic grading system within first year Computer Science programming modules,"Reliable and pedagogically sound automated feedback and grading systems are highly coveted by educators. Automatic grading systems are useful for ensuring equity of grading of student submissions to assignments and providing timely feedback on the work. Many of these systems test submissions to assignments based on test cases and the outputs that they achieve, while others use unit tests to check the submissions. The approach presented in this paper checks submissions based on test cases but also analyses what the students actually wrote in their code. Assignment questions are constructed based around the concepts that the student are currently learning in lectures, and the patterns searched for in their submissions are based on these concepts. In this paper we show how to implement this approach effectively. We analyse the use of an automatic grading system within first year Computer Science programming modules and show that the system is straightforward to use and suited for novice programmers, while providing automatic grading and feedback. Evaluation received from students, demonstrators and lecturers show the system is extremely beneficial. The evaluation shows that such systems allow demonstrators more time to assist students during labs. Lecturers can also provide instant feedback to students while keeping track of their progress and identifying where the gaps in students' knowledge are. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Hegarty-Kelly E., Mooney D.A.",2021,Scopus,10.1145/3437914.3437973,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099470971&doi=10.1145%2f3437914.3437973&partnerID=40&md5=0aba185289ad7ed3f9f00b735ea32667

On using Deep Reinforcement Learning to dynamically derive 5G New Radio TDD pattern,"The deployment of 5G and 6G is highly motivated by the emerging network services that demand more band-width and very low latency. Besides, these services are shifting from dominant Downlink (DL) Traffic to a more equilibrate DL/UpLink (UL) and dominant UL traffic for specific emerging services. One option to accommodate this new behavior is to use Time Duplex Division (TDD), where the radio frame is shared between UL and DL time slots, namely UL/DL pattern. While 4G TDD has a fixed number of configurations that cannot be updated on runtime, 5GNR allows complete flexibility to define the UL/DL pattern. Therefore, 5G base stations can dynamically change the pattern to adapt to the type of traffic (i.e., UL or DL). However, the 5G standard does not specify algorithms or solutions to derive the UL/DL pattern. To fill this gap, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that adds intelligence to the base station to self-adapt to the traffic pattern of the cell type. The proposed DRL algorithm monitors UL and DL buffers at the 5G base station to derive the optimal UL/DL pattern in respect to the current traffic configuration. The proposed solution delivers the optimal configuration in a timely and efficient manner. Simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to avoid buffer overflow and ensure the generality by reacting to traffic pattern changes. © 2021 IEEE.","Bagaa M., Boutiba K., Ksentini A.",2021,Scopus,10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685820,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127299008&doi=10.1109%2fGLOBECOM46510.2021.9685820&partnerID=40&md5=84c15e5a884351f65546f0182660593a
Microservices-based IoT Monitoring Application with a Domain-driven Design Approach,"The growth in the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly massive. Along with the continuous development of the IoT platform, there are obstacles in the number of nodes that continue to increase. In addition, there are growing issues of availability, scalability, and functionality of applications that will lead to dead code. Micro-services architectural pattern emerges as an alternative. However, the service decomposition process and data management on services in Micro-service applications require special attention. Based on the issues described above, in this study, the Micro-services architecture paradigm with a domain-driven design (DDD) approach is applied to develop an IoT Monitoring application that can handle various IoT projects on one platform. The results show that a definition of a service is designed to be more accurate. The application of the DDD concept in breaking down application services helps in mapping each domain. Therefore, it can produce adaptive software products and generate easy-to-maintain code. The Micro-service architecture with a REST API-based approach applied to the IoT monitoring application has worked well, tested at the unit testing, integration, and performance stages. Based on performance testing results, the number of nodes (with three sensors per node) that can access simultaneously reaches 75 nodes. The total sensors in one node can have up to 10 sensors per node with a response time of less than 100ms. System development can be done without overhauling the entire system and does not interfere with the performance of other services. © 2021 IEEE.","Rahmatulloh A., Sari D.W., Shofa R.N., Darmawan I.",2021,Scopus,10.1109/ICADEIS52521.2021.9701966,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126516394&doi=10.1109%2fICADEIS52521.2021.9701966&partnerID=40&md5=4e3d7842c433920455a550c5361085c3
A Compressive Sensing Based Channel Prediction Scheme with Uneven Pilot Design in Mobile Massive MIMO Systems,"Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is a widely used technique that can provide tremendous gain in spectral efficiency. However, the degradation of beamforming performance due to outdated Channel State Information at the Transmitter side (CSIT) induced by mobility of users, both in Time Division Duplex (TDD) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) modes, has been a severe problem awaiting to be solved. Many channel prediction schemes have been proposed to address this problem. Most of them focus on the prediction of future CSI on pilot symbols, then reconstruct the non-pilot symbols through conventional interpolation methods. However, the CSI cannot be simply reconstructed through interpolation in high mobility scenario because of the limitation of even pilot design - the phenomenon is named as 'Doppler aliasing' in this paper. To address this, we propose a novel uneven pilot pattern that can provide more Doppler spectrum resolution compared with even pilot which is currently used in most of communication systems. Based on the novel pilot setting, we then propose a channel prediction scheme based on the compressive sensing technique. Numerical results show our scheme can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms, including deep neural networks and autoregression models, for about 15 percents in terms of average throughput in simulated channel generated by the COST2100 channel model. © 2021 IEEE.","Shi Y., Jiang Z., Liu Y., Wang Y., Xu S.",2021,Scopus,10.1109/WCSP52459.2021.9613184,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123357894&doi=10.1109%2fWCSP52459.2021.9613184&partnerID=40&md5=18327d88a1ce76ae902cb87bcfa56108
"Exploring taxi demand distribution of comprehensive land-use patterns using online car-hailing data and points of interest in chengdu, china","With the rapid advance of urbanization, land-use intensity is increasing, and various land-use forms gather to form comprehensive land-use patterns. Traffic demand shows variability and complexity under comprehensive land-use patterns. Accurate analysis of traffic demand in urban transportation is the key to active traffic control and road guidance. Researchers have widely studied the relationship between traffic demand and land-use patterns, while land-use intensity is ignored when classifying land-use patterns, and the traffic demand distribution in each land-use pattern is not studied specifically. Taxi is a flexible public mode in urban areas, and taxi demand is an important component in analyzing traffic demand and identifying traffic hot-spots in cities. This paper explores taxi demand distribution of comprehensive land-use patterns using online car-hailing data and points of interest (POI) in Chengdu, China. The demand-driven traffic analysis zones are developed by clustering origin– destination points of online car-hailing services. Using POI data, comprehensive land-use patterns are classified with land-use forms and land-use intensity. The K-shape algorithm is adopted to extract the typical taxi demand distribution in each comprehensive land-use pattern. Finally, two indicators, total taxi demand (TTD) and taxi demand difference (TDD), are computed and further analyzed. Results show that taxi demand distribution is still differential even under the same land-use pattern.

On time-dependent trip distance distribution with for-hire vehicle trips in chicago,"For transportation system analysis in a new space dimension with respect to individual trips’ remaining distances, vehicle trips demand has two main components: the departure time and the trip distance. In particular, the trip distance distribution (TDD) is a direct input to the bathtub model in the new space dimension, and is a very important variable to consider in many applications, such as the development of distance-based congestion pricing strategies or mileage tax. For a good understanding of the demand pattern, both the distribution of trip initiation and trip distance should be calibrated from real data. In this paper, it is assumed that the demand pattern can be described by the joint distribution of trip distance and departure time. In other words, TDD is assumed to be time-dependent, and a calibration and validation methodology of the joint probability is proposed, based on log-likelihood maximization and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The calibration method is applied to empirical for-hire vehicle trips in Chicago, and it is concluded that TDD varies more within a day than across weekdays. The hypothesis that TDD follows a negative exponential, log-normal, or Gamma distribution is rejected. However, the best fit is systematically observed for the time-dependent log-normal probability density function. In the future, other trip distributions should be considered and also non-parametric probability density estimation should be explored for a better understanding of the demand pattern. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.","Martínez I., Jin W.-L.",2021,Scopus,10.1177/03611981211021552,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120033910&doi=10.1177%2f03611981211021552&partnerID=40&md5=0c78c68f8fc6bdf4b4ade1b8c4496561

ART for Agile: Autonomous Real-Time Testing in the Product Development Cycle,"Autonomous Real-time Testing (ART) is a concept for generating test cases that can be executed automatically, without interaction by testers, while the system under test physically remains in operation. The concept is also useful to continuously testing software while being developed. ART complements Test-Driven Development (TDD) because part of ART is the use of Digital Twins that emulate sensors, actuators, and Cloud services during software development, thus improving the ability of the development team to test systems under development. Moreover, because test cases are constantly being extended using an user-driven Artificial Intelligence approach, requirements, especially for security and privacy protection can be kept under control on a nightly base. This paper describes the theoretical background and its consequences for the software process and future improvements needed for digitalization. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fehlmann T., Kranich E.",2021,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-030-85521-5_25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115108553&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-85521-5_25&partnerID=40&md5=f98bc4bfd0fa228b9c0d458685676b94
Automatic firmware emulation through invalidity-guided knowledge inference,"Emulating firmware for microcontrollers is challenging due to the tight coupling between the hardware and firmware. This has greatly impeded the application of dynamic analysis tools to firmware analysis. The state-of-the-art work automatically models unknown peripherals by observing their access patterns, and then leverages heuristics to calculate the appropriate responses when unknown peripheral registers are accessed. However, we empirically found that this approach and the corresponding heuristics are frequently insufficient to emulate firmware. In this work, we propose a new approach called µEmu to emulate firmware with unknown peripherals. Unlike existing work that attempts to build a general model for each peripheral, our approach learns how to correctly emulate firmware execution at individual peripheral access points. It takes the image as input and symbolically executes it by representing unknown peripheral registers as symbols. During symbolic execution, it infers the rules to respond to unknown peripheral accesses. These rules are stored in a knowledge base, which is referred to during the dynamic firmware analysis. µEmu achieved a passing rate of 95% in a set of unit tests for peripheral drivers without any manual assistance. We also evaluated µEmu with real-world firmware samples and new bugs were discovered. © 2021 by The USENIX Association.

Pattern-based design applied to cultural heritage knowledge graphs,"Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have become an established and recognised practice for guaranteeing good quality ontology engineering. There are several ODP repositories where ODPs are shared as well as ontology design methodologies recommending their reuse. Performing rigorous testing is recommended as well for supporting ontology maintenance and validating the resulting resource against its motivating requirements. Nevertheless, it is less than straightforward to find guidelines on how to apply such methodologies for developing domain-specific knowledge graphs. ArCo is the knowledge graph of Italian Cultural Heritage and has been developed by using eXtreme Design (XD), an ODP- and test-driven methodology. During its development, XD has been adapted to the need of the CH domain e.g. gathering requirements from an open, diverse community of consumers, a new ODP has been defined and many have been specialised to address specific CH requirements. This paper presents ArCo and describes how to apply XD to the development and validation of a CH knowledge graph, also detailing the (intellectual) process implemented for matching the encountered modelling problems to ODPs. Relevant contributions also include a novel web tool for supporting unit-testing of knowledge graphs, a rigorous evaluation of ArCo, and a discussion of methodological lessons learned during ArCo's development. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Automating test oracles from restricted natural language agile requirements,"Manual testing of software requirements written in natural language for agile or any other methodology requires more time and human resources. This leaves the testing process error prone and time consuming. For satisfied end users with bug-free software delivered on time, there is a need to automate the test oracle process for natural language or informal requirements. The automation of the test oracle is relatively easier with formal requirements, but this task is difficult to achieve with natural language requirements. This study proposes an approach called Restricted Natural Language Agile Requirements Testing (ReNaLART) to automate the test oracle from restricted natural language agile requirements. For this purpose, it uses an existing user story template with some modifications for writing user stories. This helps in identifying test input and expected output for a user story. For comparison of expected and observed outputs it makes use of a regex pattern and string distance functions. It is capable of assigning different types of verdicts automatically depending upon the similarity/dissimilarity between observed and expected outputs of user stories. ReNaLART is validated using several case studies of different domains, namely, OLX Pakistan, Mental Health Tests, McDelivery Pakistan, BlueStacks, Power Searching with Google, TensorFlow Playground, w3Schools 2018 offline and Touch'D. It revealed several faults in five of the above listed eight applications. Plus, the proposed test oracle on an average took 0.02 s for test data generation, expected output generation and verdict assignment. Both these facts show the fault revealing effectiveness and efficiency of ReNaLART. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","Malik M.I., Sindhu M.A., Khattak A.S., Abbasi R.A., Saleem K.",2021,Scopus,10.1111/exsy.12608,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088308770&doi=10.1111%2fexsy.12608&partnerID=40&md5=5f8455235608a804878d728fb0c4a66f
Effects of gestational thiamine-deprivation and/or exposure to ethanol on crucial offspring rat brain enzyme activities,"Objective: The fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a group of clinical conditions associated with the in utero exposure to ethanol (EtOH). We have recently examined the effects of a moderate maternal exposure to EtOH on crucial brain enzyme activities in offspring rats, and discussed the translational challenges arising when attempting to simulate any of the clinical conditions associated with FASD. Materials and methods: In this current study, we: (i) address the need for a more consistent and reliable in vivo experimental platform that could simulate milder cases of FASD complicated by simultaneous thiamine-deprivation during gestation and (ii) explore the effects of such a moderate maternal exposure pattern to EtOH and a thiamine-deficient diet (TDD) on crucial enzyme activities in the offspring rat brains. Results: We demonstrate a significant decrease in the newborn and 21-day-old offspring body and brain weight due to maternal dietary thiamine-deprivation, as well as evidence of crucial brain enzyme activity alterations that in some cases are present in the offspring rat brains long after birth (and the end of the maternal exposure to both EtOH and TDD). Conclusions: Our findings provide a preliminary characterization of important neurochemical effects due to maternal exposure to EtOH and TDD during gestation that might affect the offspring rat neurodevelopment, and that characterization should be further explored in a brain region-specific manner level as well as through the parallel examination of changes in the offspring rat brain lipid composition. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Stolakis V., Liapi C., Al-Humadi H., Kalafatakis K., Gkanti V., Bimpis A., Skandali N., Tsela S., Theocharis S., Zarros A., Tsakiris S.",2021,Scopus,10.1080/14767058.2019.1667973,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073928544&doi=10.1080%2f14767058.2019.1667973&partnerID=40&md5=299525a38e492cec49a3b0a222a2f37a
Learning Personalized Codebook for TDD Non-Antenna Switching System,"In this paper we investigate the codebook design for a time division duplex (TDD) non-antenna switching system, where the user device is equipped with two receive radio frequency (RF) chains but only one transmit RF chain. To acquire the channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), we resort to a mixture of channel sounding and limited feedback, where the former is employed to obtain the CSIT of the antenna connected to the transmit RF chain and the latter is employed for the other antenna. We propose a deep learning method to design the codebook for limited feedback. The learned codebook is distinguished from the traditional ones in two ways. First, the learned codebook is so-called personalized, which is not fixed but adapt to the partially known CSIT. Second, the codebook exhibits different beam patterns from the traditional codebook that is designed for quantization error minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned codebook can achieve higher data rate with lower complexity than traditional codebook. © 2020 IEEE.","Miao H., Han S., Li Y., Yang C.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/ICSP48669.2020.9320967,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100266523&doi=10.1109%2fICSP48669.2020.9320967&partnerID=40&md5=861f70229ad530eb21958eeb547eea82
Detecting software performance problems using source code analysis techniques,"Software is evolving rapidly. Many software systems release new versions in short iterations. Code changes within such versions may be enhancements, bug fixes, or new features. While preserving some of those changes, the functionality of software may accidentally degrade its performance within a new version when compared to a previous version thus introducing performance regressions. Developers suffer from finding code changes that cause performance regressions especially with a large number of code changes. The cost of detecting performance regressions increases massively as the size of the changes increases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatically identifying potential code changes that cause performance regression from one system version to a subsequent one using source code analysis techniques. Such approach is realized through a prototype tool called PerfDetect. PerfDetect retrieves the changed source code across new and previous version of a specific application's source code. PerfDetect automatically: (a) identifies relevant unit test cases for the changed source code within the new version, (b) compares the execution time of these relevant test cases across the new and previous system versions using various loads to detect performance regressions, and (c) analyzes the root causes for such performance regression within the corresponding source code. In case no relevant unit tests are found as per step (a), automatically generated unit tests for the changed code are used instead within step (a). The proposed approach is evaluated on four open-source applications to assess its ability to detect performance regressions and identify their root causes. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically detect the root cause of performance regression in a shorter time as compared to alternative performance detection approaches. Furthermore, PerfDetect detects performance regressions, that were missed by other performance regression techniques, due to its reliance on source code analysis techniques. © 2020","Eid S., Makady S., Ismail M.",2020,Scopus,10.1016/j.eij.2020.02.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079888500&doi=10.1016%2fj.eij.2020.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=56c468076f061549e973b08bf2f8657a
Tilt Angle Optimization in Dynamic TDD mmWave Cellular Scenarios,"With the introduction of massive MIMO and directional transmissions, antenna configuration has arisen as a major factor influencing coverage and capacity in fifth generation mobile networks. In particular, mechanical tilting can yield performance advancements that cannot be achieved by purely electronic steering, due to the presence of grating lobes and antenna pattern attenuations. In this letter, the performance of mmWave cellular systems is evaluated in terms of SINR when an adjacent-channel node is interfering with an (UL) transmission. We examine a mobile scenario complete with dynamic (TDD) and highlight how the optimization of the antenna tilt angle can drastically improve the overall network performance. Antenna down-tilt can be properly optimized according to both the environment and the antenna settings, thus reducing the overall interference level. We propose a general methodology and discuss a number of important network considerations, towards an effective optimization of the tilt angle. Our evaluation makes it possible to determine the best tilting configuration to be used, according to the scenario considered. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Rebato M., Rose L., Zorzi M.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/LCOMM.2020.3008870,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096176434&doi=10.1109%2fLCOMM.2020.3008870&partnerID=40&md5=c6a18a86d8f63d9e0fd6d50f88ab0c57
A Large scale study on the effectiveness of manual and automatic unit test generation,"Recently, an increasingly large amount of effort has been devoted to implementing tools to generate unit test suites automatically. Previous studies have investigated the effectiveness of these tools by comparing automatically generated test suites (ATSs) to manually written test suites (MTSs). Most of these studies report that ATSs can achieve higher code coverage, or even mutation coverage, than MTSs, particularly when suites are generated from defective code. However, these studies usually consider a limited amount of classes or subject programs, while the adoption of such tools in the industry is still low. This work aims to compare the effectiveness of ATSs and MTSs when applied as regression test suites. We conduct an empirical study, using ten programs (1368 classes), written in Java, that already have MTSs and apply two sophisticated tools that automatically generate test cases: Randoop and EvoSuite. To evaluate the test suites' effectiveness, we use line and mutation coverage. Our results indicate that MTSs are, in general, more effective than ATSs regarding the investigated metrics. Moreover, the number of generated test cases may not indicate test suites' effectiveness. Furthermore, there are situations when ATSs are more effective, and even when ATSs and MTSs can be complementary. © 2020 ACM.","Souza B., MacHado P.",2020,Scopus,10.1145/3422392.3422407,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099399953&doi=10.1145%2f3422392.3422407&partnerID=40&md5=4a52f6ba71581fa1e35398d35b1142ca
An empirical study of automatically-generated tests from the perspective of test smells,"Developing test code can be as or more expensive than developing production code. Commonly, developers use automated unit test generators to speed up software testing. The purpose of such tools is to shorten production time without decreasing code quality. Nonetheless, unit tests usually do not have a quality check layer above testing code, which might be hard to guarantee the quality of the generated tests. A strategy to verify the tests quality is to analyze the presence of test smells in test code. Test smells are characteristics in the test code that possibly indicate weaknesses in test design and implementation. Their presence could be used as a quality indicator. In this paper, we present an empirical study to analyze the quality of unit test code generated by automated test tools. We compare the tests generated by two tools (Randoop and Evo-Suite) with the existing unit test suite of twenty-one open-source Java projects. We analyze the unit test code to detect the presence of nineteen types of test smells.

Specification testing of agent-based simulation using property-based testing,"The importance of Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) as scientific method to generate data for scientific models in general and for informed policy decisions in particular has been widely recognised. However, the important technique of code testing of implementations like unit testing has not generated much research interested so far. As a possible solution, in previous work we have explored the conceptual use of property-based testing. In this code testing method, model specifications and invariants are expressed directly in code and tested through automated and randomised test data generation. This paper expands on our previous work and explores how to use property-based testing on a technical level to encode and test specifications of ABS. As use case the simple agent-based SIR model is used, where it is shown how to test agent behaviour, transition probabilities and model invariants. The outcome are specifications expressed directly in code, which relate whole classes of random input to expected classes of output. During test execution, random test data is generated automatically, potentially covering the equivalent of thousands of unit tests, run within seconds on modern hardware. This makes property-based testing in the context of ABS strictly more powerful than unit testing, as it is a much more natural fit due to its stochastic nature. © 2020, The Author(s).","Thaler J., Siebers P.-O.",2020,Scopus,10.1007/s10458-020-09473-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086633506&doi=10.1007%2fs10458-020-09473-8&partnerID=40&md5=50f79b2f45dcadc4b49057474ef3f426

In this paper, we propose a new, pattern-based approach that can help developers improve the quality of test names of JUnit tests by making them more descriptive. It does this by detecting non-descriptive test names and in some cases, providing additional information about how the name can be improved.

Automatic Generation of Effective Unit Tests based on Code Behaviour,"A large amount of test cases is very useful to check the correctness of a software system while it is developed. Often a considerable time is dedicated by human programmers to designing effective test cases. This paper proposes an approach for automatically generating test cases tailored to the characteristics of the code under test. For this, the classes of a software system to be tested are characterised by a static code analysis aiming at summarising and representing their behaviour. As test cases check the behaviour of code, classes that exhibit a close behaviour may be checked using similar test cases.

TestEvoViz: Visual Introspection for Genetically-Based Test Coverage Evolution,"Genetic algorithms are an efficient mechanism to generate unit tests. Automatically generated unit tests are known to be an important asset to identify software defects and define oracles. However, configuring the test generation is a tedious activity for a practitioner due to the inherent difficulty to adequately tuning the generation process.This paper presents TestEvoViz, a visual technique to introspect the generation of unit tests using genetic algorithms. TestEvoViz offers the practitioners a visual support to expose some of the decisions made by the test generation. A number of case studies are presented to illustrate the expressiveness of TestEvoViz to understand the effect of the algorithm configuration.Artifact-https://github.com/andreina-covi/ArtifactSSG © 2020 IEEE.","Vidaure A.C., Lopez E.C., Alcocer J.P.S., Bergel A.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/VISSOFT51673.2020.00005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099468052&doi=10.1109%2fVISSOFT51673.2020.00005&partnerID=40&md5=549f9f3a5f3ff71473d0e106dc47524f
Free the Bugs: Disclosing Blocking Violations in Reactive Programming,"In programming, concurrency allows threads to share processing units interleaving and seemingly simultaneous to improve resource utilization and performance. Previous research has found that concurrency faults are hard to avoid, hard to find, often leading to undesired and unpredictable behavior. Further, with the growing availability of multi-core devices and adaptation of concurrency features in high-level languages, concurrency faults occur reportedly often, which is why countermeasures must be investigated to limit harm. Reactive programming provides an abstraction to simplify complex concurrent and asynchronous tasks through reactive language extensions such as the RxJava and Project Reactor libraries for Java. Still, blocking violations are possibly resulting in concurrency faults with no Java compiler warnings. BlockHound is a tool that detects incorrect blocking by wrapping the original code and intercepting blocking calls to provide appropriate runtime errors. In this study, we seek an understanding of how common blocking violations are and whether a tool such as BlockHound can give us insight into the root-causes to highlight them as pitfalls to developers. The investigated Softwares are Java-based open-source projects using reactive frameworks selected based on high star ratings and large fork quantities that indicate high adoption. We activated BlockHound in the project's test-suites and analyzed log files for common patterns to reveal blocking violations in 7/29 investigated open-source projects with 5024 stars and 1437 forks. A small number of system calls could be identified as root-causes. We here present countermeasures that successfully removed the uncertainty of blocking violations. The code's intentional logic was retained in all validated projects through passing unit-Tests. © 2020 IEEE.","Dobslaw F., Vallin M., Sundstrom R.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/SCAM51674.2020.00025,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097654261&doi=10.1109%2fSCAM51674.2020.00025&partnerID=40&md5=2ee08f56ebcd37e02662692426ed2777
"Treatment Patterns, Adherence, and Persistence Associated With Human Regular U-500 Insulin: A Real-World Evidence Study","OBJECTIVE | Human regular U-500 insulin (U-500R) is concentrated insulin with basal and prandial activity that can be used as insulin monotherapy. The goal of this study was to better understand treatment patterns (total daily dose [TDD] and concomitant medications), adherence, and persistence in real-world patients treated with U-500R. DESIGN AND METHODS | We selected patients from the Truven Health MarketScan database who initiated U-500R between 2010 and 2013. We collected data for three periods: Pre-index (12 months before initiation), post-index (12 months after initiation or until a gap of $60 days in U-500R claims), and follow-up (12 months after post-index). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a regression model as appropriate. RESULTS | We identified 1,582 patients who met the selection criteria. The median TDD of U-500R during the post-index period was 333 units/day, with 70.0% of patients using 300–400 units/day. During the post-index period, 74.1% of patients had U-500R claims that did not overlap with prescriptions for other insulins, interpreted as U-500R monotherapy. Among patients with $1 U-500R fill in the post-index period (n 5 1,208), 54.4% had a medication possession ratio (MPR, a measure of adherence) $80%. Although 849 patients had a gap of $60 days in U-500R claims in the post-index period, 602 of those resumed U-500R in the follow-up period. Of the 733 patients who had no gap in U-500R claims in the post-index period, 286 had a gap of $60 days in claims in year 2, and 447 continued with U-500R treatment beyond 2 years. CONCLUSION | These results demonstrate that U-500R was commonly used as insulin monotherapy, with a median TDD.300 units/day. Compared with published, relevant studies of other insulins, U-500R showed similar or greater adherence and persistence rates. These new data may help guide clinical decision-making when choosing insulin therapy for patients requiring high doses of insulin. © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.","Chen J., Kao C.Y., He X., Fan L., Jackson J.A., Juneja R.",2020,Scopus,10.2337/ds19-0060,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120436796&doi=10.2337%2fds19-0060&partnerID=40&md5=9f940f406c79c7cd79f469f2eb482aa0
Treatment patterns and characteristics of individuals initiating high-dose insulin for type 2 diabetes mellitus,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined patient characteristics and treatment patterns of high-dose insulin therapy (>200 units/day) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). OBJECTIVE: To understand patient characteristics, dosing, adherence, and persistence related to high-dose insulin therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that used administrative claims from a large national health plan. Patients were identified who had been diagnosed with T2DM and who were aged 18-89 years, enrolled in a commercial or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan, newly initiated on a total daily dose (TDD) >200 units of insulin between January 2011 and August 2015. Patients were required to be enrolled 6 months before and 12 months after the index date. Patients were categorized to Regimen-100 if treated with U-100 insulin only or Regimen-500 if treated with U-500R with or without U-100. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. An adjustment factor for the days supply was calculated as the ratio of median time between insulin claims, and median pharmacy reported days supply for each insulin prescription. Adjusted days supply, quantity, and concentration were used to calculate TDD for each quarter after the index date. Adherence was measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC) for each regimen. Persistence was measured in 2 ways: the percentage of patients remaining on index medications in each quarter and the proportion of patients who maintained TDD>200 units during all 4 quarters of the 12-month post-index period. RESULTS: We identified 2,339 patients newly titrated up to TDD>200 units on either Regimen-100 (2,062, 88.2%) or Regimen-500 (277, 11.8%). Patients on Regimen-500 were slightly younger with higher prevalence of comorbidities. The mean TDD (SD) for Regimen-100 decreased from 228.6 (36.0) units during the first quarter to 194.2 (181.4) units during the last quarter. The mean TDD (SD) for Regimen-500 increased from 294.2 (102.2) units in the first quarter to 304.8 (281.6) units in last quarter. The average adherence to the high-dose insulin regimen was 68.2% (30.7; median 72.6%) for the Regimen-100 cohort and 75.5% (27.0; median 85.2%) for the Regimen-500 cohort. In the Regimen-100 and Regimen-500 cohorts, 45.3% and 55.2% had a PDC≥80%, respectively. Only 23.0% and 51.6% of patients maintained TDD>200 units for the Regimen-100 and Regimen-500 cohorts, respectively, throughout the 4 quarters after the index date. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that many patients did not maintain high-dose insulin use over time, especially those on standard U-100 insulin only. This dosing pattern appears to reflect the differences in patient characteristics, insulin needs, and adherence/persistence behavior between those on Regimen-100 and those on Regimen-500. © 2020, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.

The hidden cost of backward compatibility: When deprecation turns into technical debt - An experience report,"Context The micro-services architectural pattern advocates for the partitioning of functionality into loosely coupled services, which should be backward compatible, to enable independent upgrades. Deprecation is commonly used as a tool to manage multiple versions of methods or services. However, deprecation carries a cost in that tests might be duplicated and might rely on services that have become deprecated over time. Objective Using the terms of the Technical Debt metaphor, we explore the consequences of deprecation, and how it has affected the test base during seven years. Method We take an exploratory approach, reporting on experiences found before and after servicing parts of the incurred Technical Debt. We mine code repositories and validate our findings with experienced developers. Results We found that the growth of deprecation debt varied a lot. Some services experienced substantial growth, but most did not. Unit tests, where deprecation is visible in the developers' tools, were much less affected than integration tests, which lack such visualization mechanisms. While servicing debt of 121 out of 285 deprecated services, we discovered that up to 29% of the spent effort could be attributed to accrued interest. However, this is an upper bound; there could be less impact, depending on whether scripting could be used to service the debt or not. Conclusion This paper illustrates that integration tests can be viewed as a debt from the perspective of deprecated services. While the pattern was that deprecated services (debt principal) experienced no or little accrued interest, some, highly used, services experienced a lot, particularly during stressful times. Java-based tests, where deprecation is visible in the IDE, did not experience a similar pattern of increasing debt. We postulate that deprecation debt should be kept visible, either using developer tools or statistical reports. © 2020 ACM.","Sundelin A., Gonzalez-Huerta J., Wnuk K.",2020,Scopus,10.1145/3387906.3388629,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093112486&doi=10.1145%2f3387906.3388629&partnerID=40&md5=483faf82153ebba284e0d089368e897a
"Dryness/wetness pattern over the Three-River Headwater Region: Variation characteristic, causes, and drought risks","The dryness/wetness patterns are a significant reference for stakeholders in developing reasonable strategies in regard to water resource management, prediction, prevention of extreme events, and management of agricultural activities; however, no attempts have been made to systematically quantify the dryness/wetness patterns and drought conditions over the Three-River Headwater Region (TRHR) of China, where the ecosystem is highly sensitive to climate change. The spatio-temporal characteristics of dryness/wetness for TRHR, as well as the reference evapotranspiration (ETr), precipitation (Pre), and drought risk, were all investigated for the period of 1961–2015. Using the methods of FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO-56), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the Manner–Kendall (M–K) test, Pettitt test, factor contribution rate, and correlation analysis, the variation in the patterns of dryness/wetness, ETr, and Pre, and the causes behind dryness/wetness were discussed. Results indicated that the TRHR underwent a wetting tendency, which was characterized by decreasing ETr and increasing Pre based on the SPEI-12M during 1961–2015. Moreover, 1971–1980 was the driest period, while 2001–2015 was the wettest period. A significant difference between seasons was detected in the dryness/wetness patterns during all study periods, as well as in extreme droughts. The TRHR underwent an overall wetting trend with 85% of the stations' SPEI-3M showing increased variation during spring, in contrast with the north–south distribution pattern of the dryness/wetness with variation in the SPEI during summer. Moreover, it can be seen that droughts with higher longest drought duration (LDD) and total drought duration (TDD) were mostly located on the edge of the eastern and northern TRHR. The influencing factors demonstrate the vital roles of Pre and ETr in generating variation in the dryness/wetness patterns of the southern and northern parts of the TRHR, respectively. There is evidence indicating that Niño3.4, North Atlantic oscillation, and Arctic oscillation played more important roles in the variation of dryness/wetness patterns and Pre in TRHR. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","Li S., Yao Z., Wang R., Liu Z.",2020,Scopus,10.1002/joc.6413,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076167771&doi=10.1002%2fjoc.6413&partnerID=40&md5=bd19e81227a3fdb5f44bf57050ef9156
Extending symbolic execution for automated testing of stored procedures,"Stored procedures in database management systems are often used to implement complex business logic. Correctness of these procedures is critical for flawless working of the system. However, testing them remains difficult due to many possible database states and constraints on data. This leads to mostly manual testing. Newer tools offer automated execution for unit testing of stored procedures but the test cases are still written manually. We propose an approach of using dynamic symbolic execution for generating automated test cases and corresponding database states for stored procedures. We model the constraints on data imposed by the schema and the SQL statements, treating values in database tables as symbolic. We use SMT solver to find values that will drive the stored procedure on a particular execution path. We instrument the internal execution plans generated by PostgreSQL to extract constraints. We use Z3 to generate test cases consisting of table data and procedure inputs. Our evaluation using stored procedures from a large business application and various GitHub repositories quantifies the evidence of effectiveness of our technique by generating test cases that lead to schema constraint violations and user-defined exceptions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Abdul Ghafoor M., Mahmood M.S., Siddiqui J.H.",2020,Scopus,10.1007/s11219-019-09453-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068909745&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-019-09453-6&partnerID=40&md5=2459c85be59059bf59a8189895807116

This paper will discuss about the design and analysis of waveguide slot antenna for LTE (Long Term Evolution) at a frequency of 2.3 to 2.4 GHz. The results obtained will be used for reference whether the antenna can be used for LTE-TDD frequencies. This research was conducted in two steps. The first step involved simulation of antenna design and optimization using 3D Electromagnetic Simulator software. Data simulation results showed that the working frequency of the antenna between 2.30 to. While in the second step, fabrication and measurement were carried out using a spectrum analyser and network analyser. The results obtained from measurements show that the antenna has a frequency between 2.28 to 2.41 GHz with bandwidth 130 MHz. The antenna has a directional radiation pattern with a gain at a frequency of 2.3 MHz of 15.68 dBi.

3D Beamforming based Dynamic TDD Interference Mitigation Scheme,"Dynamic Time Division Duplexing (D-TDD) allows cells to accommodate asymmetric traffic variations with high resource assignment flexibility. However, this feature is limited by two additional types of interference between cells in opposite transmission direction: downlink (DL) to uplink (UL) and UL to DL interference. Therefore, using this mode with macrocell deployments requires interference mitigation techniques to reduce the strong DL to UL interference. 3D beamforming is an efficient technique that minimizes interference and enhances performance by exploiting a large 2D array of antennas intelligently. Combining D-TDD and 3D beamforming can make DTDD feasible for macro-cells. The aim of this work is to provide a 3D beamforming analytical model in a D-TDD based macro-cells' deployment where beamforming horizontal and vertical radiation patterns depend on the spatial distribution of random users' locations. We evaluate interference in terms of Interference to Signal Ratio (ISR). We show that the cumulative ISR can be written in terms of convergent series and its expectation is an almost sure convergent series.

Semi-Static Radio Frame Configuration for URLLC Deployments in 5G Macro TDD Networks,"Dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) is one of the major novelties of the 5G new radio standard. It notably improves the network resource utilization with sporadic directional packet arrivals. Although, the feasibility of the ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) within such deployments is critically challenged, mainly due to the crosslink interference (CLI). In this work, we propose a semistatic and computationally-efficient TDD radio frame adaptation algorithm for 5G macro deployments. Particularly, we first identify the quasi-static variance of the cross-cell traffic buffering performance, with various CLI co-existence conditions. Accordingly, a common radio frame pattern is dynamically estimated based on the filtered multi-cell traffic statistics. Our system-level simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves a highly improved URLLC outage performance, i.e., offering 40% reduction gain of the achievable URLLC outage latency compared to perfect static-TDD, and approaching the optimal interference-free flexible-TDD case; though, with a significantly lower control overhead size. © 2020 IEEE.","Esswie A.A., Pedersen K.I., Mogensen P.E.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120508,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087272311&doi=10.1109%2fWCNC45663.2020.9120508&partnerID=40&md5=79e82ad9bda469df47ca85aa11bd8de4
Key technologies for EOR in fractured-vuggy carbonate reservoirs [碳酸盐岩缝洞型油藏提高采收率关键技术],"China is rich in fractured-vuggy carbonate oil reserves, with proved reserves in place of 29.3×108 t, which has become an important target for China's hydrocarbon exploration and development, and important contributor for the increase of reserves and production. Due to the low reservoir and fluid description accuracy, the variation in flow patterns, and the difficulty to predict flow pattern by simulation of carbonate fractured-vuggy reservoirs in a burial depth of 6500m, the transverse flow in water injection is prone to cause abrupt watered-out wells, resulting in a low recovery rate of only 14.9%. Development and production in such reservoirs are a world-class problem. After many years of research and practice, we developed a series of technologies to enhance oil recovery, including geophysical description, geological modeling, water and gas injection, and acid fracturing.

Secure Single-Input-Multiple-Output Media-Based Modulation,"The media-based modulation (MBM) system, which varies its channel state by controlling the on/off status of the radio frequency (RF) mirrors, and embeds additional information bits into the mirror activation pattern, is capable of achieving significant throughput and desirable bit-error-rate (BER) performance. Hence, it has attracted increasing attention from researchers of wireless communication community. In this paper1, the information secrecy issue for MBM is investigated, and a secure single-input-multiple-output MBM (SIMO-MBM) system is proposed utilizing physical-layer security techniques. By considering the time-division duplexing (TDD) mode with channel reciprocity property, the legitimate channel state information (CSI) is applied to secure the data transmission of SIMO-MBM. More specifically, on one hand, adaptive phase rotation is imposed on the transmitted signals, where the rotation angle is determined by the phase of legitimate CSI; on the other hand, the mapping rule between the mirror activation pattern and binary bits is changed according to the amplitude of legitimate CSI. The BER performance of the eavesdropper is investigated via theoretical derivations, and the system secrecy mutual information is also derived, based on which the optimal design of the adaptive phase rotation strategy is provided. Theoretical and simulative results demonstrate that the proposed secure SIMO-MBM system is capable of enhancing the data confidentiality whilst keeping reliable data transmission. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Mao T., Wang Q., Wen M., Wang Z.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/TVT.2020.2975303,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083857125&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2020.2975303&partnerID=40&md5=450c1d40b544c37f9f300461bd652d02
Real-world data reveal unmet clinical needs in insulin treatment in Asian people with type 2 diabetes: the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register,"Aims: To explore the pattern of insulin use and glycaemic control in Asian people with type 2 diabetes, stratified by gender, young-onset diabetes (YOD; diagnosed before age 40 years), and diabetic kidney disease (DKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2). Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 97 852 patients from 11 Asian countries/regions (2007–2017) included in the prospective Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register. Results: Among 18 998 insulin users (47% women, mean ± SD age 59.2 ± 11.7 years, diabetes duration 13.2 ± 8.3 years, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 72 ± 21.4 mmol/mol [8.74 ± 1.95%], median total daily insulin dose [TDD] 0.27–0.82 units/kg), 25% and 29.5% had YOD and DKD, respectively. Premixed (44%) and basal-only (42%) insulin were the most common regimens. Despite being more commonly treated with these two regimens with higher insulin dosages, patients with YOD had worse HbA1c levels than their late-onset peers (73 ± 20.5 vs. 71 ± 21.2 mmol/mol [8.82 ± 1.87% vs. 8.66 ± 1.94%]; P &lt; 0.001). Fewer women than men attained an HbA1c level &lt; 53 mmol/mol (7%; 15.7% vs 17.1%; P = 0.018). Adjusting for age, diabetes duration, TDD, HbA1c, eGFR, and use of oral glucose-lowering drugs at baseline, the odds of self-reported hypoglycaemia were higher in women (vs. men: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.28) and in patients with DKD treated with a premixed regimen (1.81 [95% CI 1.54–2.13] vs. 1.34 [95% CI 1.16–1.54] in non-DKD; Pinteraction &lt; 0.001). Compared to basal-only regimens, premixed and basal-bolus regimens had similar HbA1c reductions but were independently associated with increased odds of hypoglycaemia (1.65 [95% CI 1.45–1.88] and 1.88 [95% CI 1.58–2.23], respectively). Conclusions: In this Asian population, there were varying patterns of insulin regimens with suboptimal glycaemic control, despite relatively high TDDs, which were influenced by gender, DKD, and YOD status. © 2020 The Authors.

The convergence of sulphur dioxide (So2) emissions per capita in china,"As the third-largest SO2 emitter in the world, China is facing mounting domestic and external pressure to tackle the increasingly serious SO2 pollution. Figuring out the convergence and persistence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions matters much for environmental policymakers in China. This study mainly utilizes the Fourier quantile unit root test to survey the convergence of the SO2 emissions per capita in 74 cities of China during the period of December 2014 to June 2019, by conducting five traditional unit root tests and a quantile root unit test as a comparative analysis. The empirical results indicate that the SO2 emissions per capita in 72 out of 74 cities in China are convergent in the sample period. The results also suggest that the unit root behavior of the SO2 emissions per capita in these cities is asymmetrically persistent at different quantiles. For the cities with the convergent SO2 emissions, the government should consider the asymmetric mean-reverting pattern of SO2 emissions when implementing environmental protection policies at different stages.

Belief Propagation Pattern-Coupled Sparse Bayesian Learning for Non-Stationary Uplink Channel Estimation over Massive-MIMO Based 5G Mobile Wireless Networks,"In this paper, we develop a novel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) scheme for recovery of block-sparse uplink channels in time-division duplex (TDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) based 5G mobile wireless networks. We first introduce a pattern-coupled hierarchical Gaussian prior to characterize the sparse channel dependency among neighboring antennas, where the dependency coefficient is modeled by birth- death process. Then, to derive hyperparameters, which are employed to control the sparsity of channel coefficients, we exploit an expectation-maximization (EM) formulation to iteratively maximize a lower bound on the posterior probability. In the M-step, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to maximize the lower bound efficiently. Finally, we develop a belief propagation (BP)-based pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning (PC-SBL) algorithm, referred to as the BP-PC-SBL, to recover block-sparse uplink channels. Based on the factor graph of blocksparse uplink channels, we show that messages in BP satisfy complex Gaussian probability distribution. Therefore, we only need to update their means and variances when updating the messages. BP-PC-SBL algorithm provides precise approximations of matrix inversion as computed by the conventional SBL algorithm, which results in significantly improved computational efficiency. Our numerical analyses validate and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes and algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.","Chen J., Zhang X.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/CISS48834.2020.1570617107,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085250188&doi=10.1109%2fCISS48834.2020.1570617107&partnerID=40&md5=de6211ac4554abb40e457b5ded30c3ea
Pedal: An infrastructure for automated feedback systems,"This paper describes Pedal, an innovative approach to the automated creation of feedback given to students in programming classes. Pedal is so named because it supports the PEDAgogical goals of instructors and is an expandable Library of components motivated by these goals. Pedal currently comes with components for type inferencing, flow analysis, pattern matching, and unit testing to provide an instructor with a rich set of resources to use in authoring and prioritizing feedback. The larger vision is the looselycoupled architecture whose components can be readily expanded or replaced. The Pedal library components are motivated by a study of contemporary automated feedback systems and our own experience. Pedal's components are described and examples are given of Pedal-based feedback from three different introductory classes at two different universities. The integration of Pedal into several programming and autograding environments is briefly described. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Sensitivity of Montague Model of Skin for predicting physiological variation in skin layers,"The mammalian skin is a complex outer covering of the body. However, for an effective non-invasive drug administration method like transdermal drug delivery (TDD), drugs have to pass through this integument system. An electrical equivalent circuit can be used to represent the complex structure of skin. This circuit can be used to calculate impedance of the skin, which is a function of frequency. The current work relates to the analysis of the transfer function (TF) of the Montague Model. This model is based on physiological stratification of skin. Sensitivity analysis is performed on this skin impedance model to study the changes in system parameters of the model. During active drug delivery, the impedance of underlying skin has to be continuously monitored within a time frame for any physiological changes. Thus when impedance measurement is calculated from the same patch of skin under different conditions, it will yield different impedance patterns, which reflects the changes in the physiological stratification of the skin. This work will enable us to understand such patterns and correlate the physical significance of the parameters of the Model. It will also enable us to predict the physiological conditions of skin layers under the effect of drugs. This analysis finds wide applications in studying skin hydration, electrical impedance monitoring, tissue classification, tissue monitoring and TDD etc. © 2020 IEEE.","Bora D.J., Dasgupta R.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/IC3A48958.2020.233260,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084991036&doi=10.1109%2fIC3A48958.2020.233260&partnerID=40&md5=b7781782bc9b4f403dea34560128df45
Design and validation of a C++ code generator from Abstract State Machines specifications,"According to best practices of model-driven engineering, the implementation of a system should be obtained from its model through a systematic model-to-code transformation. We present in this paper a methodology supported by the Asm2C++ tool, which allows the users to generate C++ code from abstract state machine models. Thanks to Asm2C++, the implementation is generated in a seamless manner with an assurance of potential bug freeness of the generated code. Following the same approach, model-based testing suggests deriving also (unit) tests from abstract models. We extend the Asm2C++ tool such that it can automatically produce unit tests for the generated code. Abstract test sequences, either generated randomly or through model checking, are translated to concrete C++ unit tests using the Boost library. In a similar manner, also, scenarios are generated in a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach. To guarantee the correctness of the transformation process, we define a mechanism to test the correctness of the model-to-code transformation with respect to two main criteria: syntactical correctness and semantic correctness, which is based on the definition of conformance between the specification and the code. Using this approach, we have devised a process able to test the generated code by reusing unit tests. The process has been used to validate our model-to-code transformations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bonfanti S., Gargantini A., Mashkoor A.",2020,Scopus,10.1002/smr.2205,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075467384&doi=10.1002%2fsmr.2205&partnerID=40&md5=604bc3ff58c979a5f9d8254716d26025

SimilaR: R Code Clone and Plagiarism Detection,"Third-party software for assuring source code quality is becoming increasingly popular. Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit tests, perform static code analysis, or inspect run-time memory use are crucial in the software development life cycle. More sophisticated methods allow for performing meta-analyses of large software repositories, e.g., to discover abstract topics they relate to or common design patterns applied by their developers. They may be useful in gaining a better understanding of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as detecting plagiarism in programming classes. A meaningful measure of similarity of computer programs often forms the basis of such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments for similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable for analysing R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather simple techniques and heuristics and fail to provide a user with the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for working with R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR package. It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but also for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked by applying some obfuscation techniques or imputing dead code. We demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency in a real-world case study. © 2020, The R Journal.

How Programming Students Trick and What JEdUnit Can Do Against It,"According to our data, about 15% of programming students trick if they are aware that only a “dumb” robot evaluates their programming assignments unattended by programming experts. Especially in large-scale formats like MOOCs, this might become a question because to trick current automated assignment assessment systems (APAAS) is astonishingly easy and the question arises whether unattended grading components grade the capability to program or to trick. This study analyzed what kind of tricks students apply beyond the well-known “copy-paste” code plagiarism to derive possible mitigation options. Therefore, this study analyzed student cheat patterns that occurred in two programming courses and developed a unit testing framework JEdUnit as a solution proposal that intentionally targets such tricky educational aspects of programming. The validation phase validated JEdUnit in another programming course. This study identified and analyzed four recurring cheat patterns (overfitting, evasion, redirection, and injection) that hardly occur in “normal” software development and are not aware to normal unit testing frameworks that are frequently used to test the correctness of student submissions. Therefore, the concept of well-known unit testing frameworks was extended by adding three “countermeasures”: randomization, code inspection, separation. The validation showed that JEdUnit detected these patterns and in consequence, reduced cheating entirely to zero. From a students perspective, JEdUnit makes the grading component more intelligent, and cheating does not pay-off anymore. This Chapter explains the cheat patterns and what features of JEdUnit mitigate them by a continuous example. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Kratzke N.,2020,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-030-58459-7_1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097364965&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-58459-7_1&partnerID=40&md5=1aa554955c9c7fb9e6373a1621bba1fe
Commonality-Driven Unit Test Generation,"Various search-based test generation techniques have been proposed to automate the generation of unit tests fulfilling different criteria (e.g., line coverage, branch coverage, mutation score, etc.). Despite several advances made over the years, search-based unit test generation still suffers from a lack of guidance due to the limited amount of information available in the source code that, for instance, hampers the generation of complex objects. Previous studies introduced many strategies to address this issue, e.g., dynamic symbolic execution or seeding, but do not take the internal execution of the methods into account. In this paper, we introduce a novel secondary objective called commonality score, measuring how close the execution path of a test case is from reproducing a common or uncommon execution pattern observed during the operation of the software. To assess the commonality score, we implemented it in EvoSuite and evaluated its application on 150 classes from JabRef, an open-source software for managing bibliography references. Our results are mixed. Our approach leads to test cases that indeed follow common or uncommon execution patterns. However, if the commonality score can have a positive impact on the structural coverage and mutation score of the generated test suites, it can also be detrimental in some cases. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Evers B., Derakhshanfar P., Devroey X., Zaidman A.",2020,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-030-59762-7_9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092894407&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-59762-7_9&partnerID=40&md5=7959cc3489d9876ee2bb54afc4c1a93c

Online Radio Pattern Optimization Based on Dual Reinforcement-Learning Approach for 5G URLLC Networks,"The fifth generation (5G) radio access technology is designed to support highly delay-sensitive applications, i.e., ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). For dynamic time division duplex (TDD) systems, the real-time optimization of the radio pattern selection becomes of a vital significance in achieving decent URLLC outage latency. In this study, a dual reinforcement machine learning (RML) approach is developed for online pattern optimization in 5G new radio TDD deployments. The proposed solution seeks to minimizing the maximum URLLC tail latency, i.e., min-max problem, by introducing nested RML instances. The directional and real-time traffic statistics are monitored and given to the primary RML layer to estimate the sufficient number of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) symbols across the upcoming radio pattern. The secondary RML sub-networks determine the DL and UL symbol structure which best minimizes the URLLC outage latency. The proposed solution is evaluated by extensive and highly-detailed system level simulations, where our results demonstrate a considerable URLLC outage latency improvement with the proposed scheme, compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic-TDD proposals. © 2013 IEEE.","Esswie A.A., Pedersen K.I., Mogensen P.E.",2020,Scopus,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089307031&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3011026&partnerID=40&md5=12a8e66220d1f7cd7ece1557d1d2efce

Design and development of multi-band multi-generation compatible MIMO antenna for wireless devices,"A planar dual-element multi-generation compatible MIMO antenna is presented in this paper. The radiating antenna elements are designed to resonate over two frequency ranges: 1.41 GHz – 2.11 GHz and 3.6 GHz – 3.8 GHz, with (S11/S22) reference considered as-10 dB,covering frequencies allotted for L1 GPS, 2G standards (GSM-1800 and GSM-1900), 3G standard (UMTS), LTE (working on TDD and FDD techniques) and 5G New Radio. The designed antenna is optimized using IE3D simulation software and fabricated on FR4 substrate having relative permittivity of 4.4, loss tangent of 0.02 and thickness of 1.6 mm. A three step isolation improvement and impedance bandwidth enhancement technique is presented to reduce the mutual coupling and cover the desired frequency range. Antenna characteristics in terms of the reflection coefficient, mutual coupling, radiation pattern and gain are measured and show good agreement with the simulated results. Diversity performance is evaluated in terms of the envelop correlation coefficient. It is found to be less than 0.12 and 0.06 in the first and second bands of frequencies, respectively. The planar structure and capability to support several frequencies of multiple generations make the proposed MIMO antenna a good candidate for integration with future wireless devices. © 2020, Paulus Editora.

Use and utility of serologic tests for rheumatoid arthritis in primary care,"Introduction: In this retrospective, register-based population study, we evaluated if anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) is a better choice than immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor (IgM RF) in primary care when rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is suspected, as it determines predictive values in real-life settings. Furthermore, the study described ordering patterns to investigate the benefit of repeated testing. Methods: Test result, requisitioning unit, test date and the patient’s social security number were collected from the Department of Clinical Immunology at Odense University Hospital in 2007-2016 and merged with patient diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry. Results: Overall, 5% were diagnosed with RA. IgM RF remained the preferred test during the entire period. Test sensitivity was 61% for IgM RF and 54% for ACPA. The test specificity was 88% for IgM RF and 96% for ACPA. PPV was higher for ACPA than for IgM RF (30% versus 12%) and NPV was equal (99%) in primary care. Few individuals seroconverted from negative to positive (ACPA 2% and IgM RF 5%) and positive to negative (ACPA 3% and IgM RF 6%). Conclusions: ACPA has a higher PPV for RA than IgM RF, whereas their NPV is identical. ACPA is the better choice when testing for RA in primary care. Seroconversion is rare, and it is only rarely relevant to retest. © 2020, Danish Medical Association.

System Test Architecture Evaluation: A Probabilistic Modeling Approach,"In this paper, we study the effects of testing architecture on system quality using a probabilistic model of unit testing. The Markovian view of the testing process relates unit quality and test quality to the expected unit/system quality, and to the expected number of tests. The model is based on replicating testing where the test is replicated only after a fail test outcome. A set of equations are generalized for many component systems. The study enables the costs and associated benefits for particular groups of components to be considered for module testing at different levels of system hierarchy. Simulation results show that the selection of an appropriate testing architecture and modular architecture can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of system testing. The model is applied to several testing architectures and test patterns to illustrate the tradeoff comparisons that can be made between different system architectures in terms of the overall test cost and the resulting system quality. Several heuristics are derived to assist in planning tests of complex systems for optimizing quality and cost before systems are built. This Markovian model of testability in systems shows promise for use from the modular unit build-level in engineering manufacture development through to strategizing portfolio-level integration and information assurance testing of new capability projects with legacy systems in a family-of-systems. The early abstract testability work reinforces the benefits of iterating testing as early and often as possible. Following trials to validate the model in different contexts and to refine the interface with systems engineers, this testability model could be added to other design for six-sigma tools and techniques to better enable systems engineering practitioners to tradeoff on testability options well before testing starts. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Efatmaneshnik M., Shoval S., Joiner K.",2019,Scopus,10.1109/JSYST.2019.2899697,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075758919&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2019.2899697&partnerID=40&md5=6b69bd298d9e943e35be668c0ea1722c
Integrated sleep scheduling for multiple relays and UEs in LTE-TDD,"Energy-saving for the LTE-A network with relay nodes in TDD mode is addressed in this paper, and integrated sleep scheduling schemes for relay nodes and user devices under a base station are designed. The authors’ two previously proposed ideas, namely, Load-Based Power Saving (LBPS) and Virtual Time, are adopted in the design, and two strategies, namely, top-down and bottom-up each with three LBPS schemes are proposed. In the top-down strategy, the load as well as the channel quality on the backhaul link is first considered to determine the sleep pattern for all relay nodes, and then the sleep schedule for UEs under each relay node is determined accordingly. On the contrary, the load and the channel quality on the access links are first considered and then integrated into the sleep schedule on the backhaul link. Two associated mechanisms for the proposed LBPS schemes to operate in the virtual time domain are also proposed in the paper, i.e., calculation of the virtual subframe capacity and the mapping mechanisms from the virtual time to the actual time. The benefit of the proposed schemes in power saving over the standard-based scheme is demonstrated by the simulation study, and the bottom-up scheme of BU-Split outperforms the other schemes under equally distributed input load as well as the hotspot scenario. Discussion on the tradeoff of the processing overhead and the performance for the proposed schemes is presented in the paper. © 2019, The Author(s).","Yang C.-C., Mai Y.-T., Chen J.-Y., Yang C.-M.",2019,Scopus,10.1186/s13638-019-1537-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071977178&doi=10.1186%2fs13638-019-1537-7&partnerID=40&md5=9e2ee19a8f888cb1d3aaddcebe8abdc2
Pendeo-epitaxy of GaN on SOI nano-pillars: Freestanding and relaxed GaN platelets on silicon with a reduced dislocation density,"Nanopendeo-epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) is considered in this study as a way of producing freestanding GaN with reduced strain and threading dislocation density (TDD) for optoelectronic applications.

"Variation in soil organic carbon stock with forest type in tropical forests of Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India","Sequestration of atmospheric carbon-dioxide in biospheric carbon (C) pools is a key strategy towards climate change mitigation. Soil is a huge C reservoir and its storage potential varies greatly with forest types. Therefore, in the present study, the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage pattern was assessed from 70 plots laid at three selected forest types comprising seven study sites at Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India: tropical dry deciduous (TDD I and TDD II), tropical semi-evergreen (TSE I and TSE II) and tropical evergreen forest (TEF I, TEF II and TEF III) at three depths (0–10, 10.1–20 and 20.1–30 cm). Statistical analyses were performed to understand the relationships between SOC stocks with other predictor variables. The SOC stock varied markedly with forest type and site-wise. The SOC ranged from 58 (TEF III) to 123.6 (TDD I) Mg C/ha with a mean of 84.9 ± 4.4 Mg C/ha at 0–30 cm depth. SOC stock decreased, while soil bulk density increased with increase in soil depth. The TDD forest type (115.6 Mg C/ha) stocked the highest SOC compared to TEF (75.1 Mg C/ha) and TSE (68.9 Mg C/ha) forest types. Of the total SOC stock (0–30 cm), 44.2, 32.0 and 23.8% were stored in 0–10, 10.1–20 and 20.1–30 cm respectively in all the forest types. In contrast, litter C stock were high in TEF and TSE forest types and low in TDD forest type. SOC showed significant (P &lt; 0.01) negative relationships with bulk density, litter C, and vegetation attributes. The SOC stock stored in the study sites amount to 212.9 (TEF III) to 453.6 (TDD I) Mg of CO2 equivalents.

Insulin requirement profiles and related factors of insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes,"Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is an effective therapy to control hyperglycemia in both patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, there is little data investigating the insulin dose setting during CSII therapy in type 2 diabetes to achieve optimal glycemic control and avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, this study is aimed to assess the dose characteristics of insulin requirement and explore the related clinical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with CSII. A total of 327 patients (195 males) aged 52.9±12.5 years old were included in this study. Patients were treated with CSII to achieve the target fasting capillary blood glucose (4.4–7.0 mmol L-1) and 2-h postprandial capillary blood glucose (4.4–10.0 mmol L-1) by adjusting insulin infusion according to the seven-point capillary blood glucose profiles. Total daily insulin dose (TDD), total daily insulin dose per kilogram (TDD kg-1) and the ratio of total basal insulin dose (TBD) to TDD (%TBa) were calculated after patients achieved the glucose targets for at least 3 days via 1–2 weeks of CSII treatment. And insulin dose, insulin dosing patterns and the relevant clinical factors were analyzed. The mean ratio of basal/bolus insulin distribution of all patients was 40%:60%. Patients with central obesity needed more TDD (51.3±17.1 U versus 43.5±14.0 U, P&lt;0.05) and TDD kg-1 (0.8±0.3 U kg-1 versus 0.7±0.2 U kg-1, P&lt;0.05) than those without central obesity. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that TDD was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting C-peptide level, 2 h-postprandial C-peptide level and time to achieve glycemic target (all P&lt;0.05); TDD kg-1 was positively correlated with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), baseline FPG, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting C-peptide level and time to achieve glycemic target, and negatively correlated with BMI (all P&lt;0.05). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that BMI (β=1.796, P&lt;0.01), WC (β=0.709, P&lt;0.01), baseline FPG (β=1.459, P&lt;0.01) and HbA1c (β=0.930, P=0.021) were independently related to TDD. Gender (β=-0.107, P=0.003), WC (β=0.005, P=0.029), baseline FPG (β=0.025, P&lt;0.01) and HbA1c (β=0.016, P=0.007) were independently associated with TDD kg-1. Gender (β=-0.015, P=0.048) and disease duration (β=0.134, P=0.029) were independently associated with %TBa. %TBa is around 40% in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with CSII when glycemic control is achieved. In addition to body weight or BMI, WC and glucose levels before CSII should be considered to set TDD. Patients with central obesity or poor glycemic control might need more TDD. Higher %TBa should be considered in female patients or patients with longer disease duration. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Yang X., Deng H., Zhang X., Yang D., Yan J., Yao B., Weng J., Xu W.",2019,Scopus,10.1007/s11427-018-9530-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067675491&doi=10.1007%2fs11427-018-9530-3&partnerID=40&md5=643aadc2c7c0bf1b192fe84056175fac
Abstract memory model for complex data structures in unit testing,"Automated test case generation is one of the key points of automated unit testing. In path-oriented automated unit testing, the abstract memory model is used to accurately extract the semantics and constraints of variables on the path, which is a prerequisite for automatically generating test cases. However, the existing abstract memory model still has shortcomings, such as incomplete type support, difficulty in handling complex operations accurately. This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of the abstract memory model and the completeness of support. Based on the existing abstract memory model the paper proposes an optimized abstract memory model supporting the expression of numeric, pointer, structure, array, union. And the constraint extraction algorithm and the non-numeric test case shape construction algorithm are improved, which can more accurately simulate the semantics of complex operations and extract constraints. Based on the optimized abstract memory, it can provide more accurate and comprehensive information for automatic test case generation. © 2019 IEEE.","Gong H., Yu H.",2019,Scopus,10.1109/EITCE47263.2019.9095152,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085680519&doi=10.1109%2fEITCE47263.2019.9095152&partnerID=40&md5=e9b2453e7e68b30e7ec96fc9b2a53879
Secure Quadrature Channel Modulation,"In this paper, a physical layer security (PLS) scheme based on quadrature channel modulation (QCM) called secure QCM (SQCM) is proposed for time division duplex (TDD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) media based modulation (MBM) systems to resist eavesdropping. By exploiting the abundant legitimate channel realizations generated by the radio frequency (RF) mirrors, secure mappings between the original information bits and the transmit patterns are designed, where the transmit patterns include the transmit antenna activation pattern (AAP), mirror activation pattern (MAP) and symbol modulation pattern. The secure mappings used by the transmitter change for each transmission and are unavailable at the eavesdropper due to the independent fading of the legitimate link and the eavesdropping link. Based on the secure mappings, the proposed SQCM conveys the source information bits securely through the complex modulation symbol and instantaneous channel realizations by using a single RF chain. The ergodic secrecy rate is analyzed and a closed-form approximation is derived. Simulation results show that the closed-form approximation coincides with the experimental ergodic secrecy rate, and the achievable ergodic secrecy rate is not influenced by the number of eavesdropping antennas or the channel advantage of the eavesdropping link. Compared to the secure MBM scheme using the traditional artificial noise (AN) technique, the proposed SQCM scheme shows significant performance gain without consuming jamming power when the eavesdropper has more antennas than the legitimate receiver. Compared to the precoded MBM and probabilistic optimized MBM schemes exploiting the eavesdropper's CSI, the proposed SQCM scheme has better secrecy performance in all SNR region and medium-to-high SNR regions respectively without requiring the eavesdropper's CSI. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Gao Z., Bai S., Liao X., Leung V.C.M.",2019,Scopus,10.1109/TVT.2019.2937446,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073870098&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2019.2937446&partnerID=40&md5=7ae0df49647dced1e202d209aa94f7eb
Comparative study of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on different sapphire substrates,"AlGaN/GaN heterostructures were grown on the conventional planar sapphire substrate (CSS), nano-scale patterned sapphire substrate (NPSS) and micro-scale patterned sapphire substrates (MPSS) by metal organic chemical vapor deposition respectively. The heterostructure grown on the MPSS has significantly lower threading dislocation density (TDD) than those grown on the NPSS and CSS. The bending and quenching of threading dislocations induced by lateral growth are the main factors for the reduction of TDD. Correspondingly, the carrier mobility of heterostructure grown on the MPSS is also the highest. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Li W., Xu S., Zhang Y., Peng R., Zhao Y., Du J., Fan X., Zhang J., Tao H., Wang X., Hao Y.",2019,Scopus,10.1016/j.spmi.2019.106221,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070515240&doi=10.1016%2fj.spmi.2019.106221&partnerID=40&md5=a9894e41f763142d806c10094f12c730
Scented since the beginning: On the diffuseness of test smells in automatically generated test code,"Software testing represents a key software engineering practice to ensure source code quality and reliability. To support developers in this activity and reduce testing effort, several automated unit test generation tools have been proposed. Most of these approaches have the main goal of covering as more branches as possible. While these approaches have good performance, little is still known on the maintainability of the test code they produce, i.e.,whether the generated tests have a good code quality and if they do not possibly introduce issues threatening their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, in this paper we study to what extent existing automated test case generation tools produce potentially problematic test code. We consider seven test smells, i.e.,suboptimal design choices applied by programmers during the development of test cases, as measure of code quality of the generated tests, and evaluate their diffuseness in the unit test classes automatically generated by three state-of-the-art tools such as RANDOOP, JTEXPERT, and EVOSUITE. Moreover, we investigate whether there are characteristics of test and production code influencing the generation of smelly tests. Our study shows that all the considered tools tend to generate a high quantity of two specific test smell types, i.e.,Assertion Roulette and Eager Test, which are those that previous studies showed to negatively impact the reliability of production code. We also discover that test size is correlated with the generation of smelly tests. Based on our findings, we argue that more effective automated generation algorithms that explicitly take into account test code quality should be further investigated and devised. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Grano G., Palomba F., Di Nucci D., De Lucia A., Gall H.C.",2019,Scopus,10.1016/j.jss.2019.07.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069618644&doi=10.1016%2fj.jss.2019.07.016&partnerID=40&md5=c680d364ff5958e74087b43b7c8794b3
Performance evaluation for the co-existence of eMBB and URLLC Networks: Synchronized versus Unsynchronized TDD,"To ensure the high level of automation required in todayâ™s industrial applications, next-generation wireless networks must enable real-time control and automation of dynamic processes with the requirements of extreme low-latency and ultra- reliable communications. In this paper, we provide a performance assessment for the co-existence of a macro (eMBB) and a local factory (URLLC) network and evaluate the network conditions under which the latency and reliability requirements of factory automation applications are met. In particular, we evaluate the co-existence of the eMBB and URLLC networks under two scenarios: (i) synchronized TDD, in which both networks follow the same TDD pattern, and (ii) unsynchronized TDD, in which the eMBB and URLLC networks follow different TDD patterns. Simulation results show that the high downlink interference from the macro base stations towards the factory results in a reduction of the downlink URLLC capacity and service availability in case of synchronized TDD and a reduction of the uplink URLLC capacity and service availability in case of unsynchronized TDD. Finally, it is shown that a promising case for co-existence is the adjacent channel allocation, for both synchronized and unsynchronized TDD deployments. Here, the required isolation to protect the URLLC network in the worst-case scenario where the factory is located next to a macro site can be handled via the factory wall penetration loss (e.g., considering high concrete or metal-coated building walls) along with other solutions such as filters, larger separation distance, and band pairing. © 2019 IEEE.","Challita U., Hiltunen K., Tercero M.",2019,Scopus,10.1109/VTCFall.2019.8890977,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075242904&doi=10.1109%2fVTCFall.2019.8890977&partnerID=40&md5=f866db4dc4103906ba639899822710ca
Automatic test improvement with DSpot: a study with ten mature open-source projects,"In the literature, there is a rather clear segregation between manually written tests by developers and automatically generated ones. In this paper, we explore a third solution: to automatically improve existing test cases written by developers. We present the concept, design and implementation of a system called DSpot, that takes developer-written test cases as input (JUnit tests in Java) and synthesizes improved versions of them as output. Those test improvements are given back to developers as patches or pull requests, that can be directly integrated in the main branch of the test code base. We have evaluated DSpot in a deep, systematic manner over 40 real-world unit test classes from 10 notable and open-source software projects. We have amplified all test methods from those 40 unit test classes. In 26/40 cases, DSpot is able to automatically improve the test under study, by triggering new behaviors and adding new valuable assertions. Next, for ten projects under consideration, we have proposed a test improvement automatically synthesized by DSpot to the lead developers. In total, 13/19 proposed test improvements were accepted by the developers and merged into the main code base. This shows that DSpot is capable of automatically improving unit-tests in real-world, large scale Java software. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Danglot B., Vera-Pérez O.L., Baudry B., Monperrus M.",2019,Scopus,10.1007/s10664-019-09692-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064832264&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-019-09692-y&partnerID=40&md5=b801eb0d10a510b36f88ec89fb8e7a1e

However, theoretical research on ICT leadership training has been not common.

Besides, the learning behavior data generated in the MOOC platform was analyzed by content analysis and lag sequence analysis. This study found that the behavior of learning course content was the main learning behavior of learners, but this behavior had no significant relationship with other behaviors.

Tests as maintainable assets via auto-generated spies: A case study involving the scala collections library's iterator trait,"In testing stateful abstractions, it is often necessary to record interactions, such as method invocations, and express assertions over these interactions. Following the Test Spy design pattern, we can reify such interactions programmatically through additional mutable state. Alternatively, a mocking framework, such as Mockito, can automatically generate test spies that allow us to record the interactions and express our expectations in a declarative domain-specific language. According to our study of the test code for Scala's Iterator trait, the latter approach can lead to a significant reduction of test code complexity in terms of metrics such as code size (in some cases over 70% smaller), cyclomatic complexity, and amount of additional mutable state required. In this tools paper, we argue that the resulting test code is not only more maintainable, readable, and intentional, but also a better stylistic match for the Scala community than manually implemented, explicitly stateful test spies. © 2019 ACM.","Laufer K., O'Sullivan J., Thiruvathukal G.K.",2019,Scopus,10.1145/3337932.3338814,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074454692&doi=10.1145%2f3337932.3338814&partnerID=40&md5=69da16d3de3bfb161ac8d10c64934d0d
Enhancing Acceptance Test-Driven Development with Model-Based Test Generation,"Acceptance test-driven development is widely used in practice. However, writing and maintaining acceptance tests is a costly and time-consuming activity, in particular when a system is tested via the GUI. In model-based testing, the tests are automatically generated from a model of the system. In this paper, we report our experience from applying a combination of acceptance test-driven development and model-based testing in several real-world projects from industry. With the application of model-based testing, we increased test coverage and extend testing to usage scenarios not exercised by the existing acceptance tests. In the industry projects, MBT was used as an enhancement rather than a replacement for ATDD. By creating a layered test automation architecture, we were able to reuse the established automation for model-based testing and to apply both approaches simultaneously. This strategy also helped us to minimize the risks and to reduce the effort involved in introducing MBT in the projects. © 2019 IEEE.","Ramler R., Klammer C.",2019,Scopus,10.1109/QRS-C.2019.00096,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073874734&doi=10.1109%2fQRS-C.2019.00096&partnerID=40&md5=d3220705fc24854bc79540d6273f7bf5
"Functions, processes, stages and application of data mining","Data mining is an automatic information discovery process by identifying patterns from large data sets or databases. The process of finding information can be done by a method of grouping data into several groups from a data set that is in data mining called the clustering method. Data mining is defined as a method of finding information that is hidden in a database that is large and difficult to obtain by using only ordinary queries. Unit Implementation and Testing, software design is a series of programs or program units. Then unit testing involves verifying that each program unit meets its specifications (Sommerville, 2003). Programs should be released after they are developed, tested to correct errors found in their quality guarantee testing (Padmini, 2005). There are two testing methods, namely: (1) The white box method is a test that focuses on the internal logic of the software (program source code); (2) The black box method is to provide actual results in accordance with the results needed. In the testing phase, the author conducted a black box method that tests the functionality of the software alone without having to know the internal structure of the program (source code). © 2019 International Journal Of Scientific and Technology Research.

CNN-based fault localization method using memory-updated patterns for integration test in an HiL environment,"Automotive electronic components are tested via hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing at the unit and integration test stages, according to ISO 26262. It is difficult to obtain debugging information from the HiL test because the simulator runs a black-box test automatically, depending on the scenario in the test script. At this time, debugging information can be obtained in HiL tests, using memory-updated information, without the source code or the debugging tool. However, this method does not know when the fault occurred, and it is difficult to select the starting point of debugging if the execution flow of the software is not known. In this paper, we propose a fault-localization method using a pattern in which each memory address is updated in the HiL test. Via a sequential pattern-mining algorithm in the memory-updated information of the transferred unit tests, memory-updated patterns are extracted, and the system learns using a convolutional neural network. Applying the learned pattern in the memory-updated information of the integration test can determine the fault point from the normal pattern. The point of departure from the normal pattern is highlighted as a fault-occurrence time, and updated addresses are presented as fault candidates. We applied the proposed method to an HiL test of an OSEK/VDX-based electronic control unit. Through fault-injection testing, we could find the cause of faults by checking the average memory address of 3.28%, and we could present the point of fault occurrence with an average accuracy of 80%. © 2019 by the authors.","Choi K.-Y., Lee J.-W.",2019,Scopus,10.3390/app9142799,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068888919&doi=10.3390%2fapp9142799&partnerID=40&md5=d92947ff89d9ea6683499e38a72fdc17
A modern approach to QENS data analysis in Mantid,"Data analysis of Quasi-elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) experiments often requires multiple steps involving fitting the elastic and quasi-elastic parts of spectra with several empirical functions and analytical models. Parameters of those models can be interdependent and also dependent on the momentum transfer vector Q. Here we present a modern data analysis interface dedicated for QENS data analysis implemented within the open source software Mantid. The interface has been implemented using the state-of-the-art design pattern Model-View-Presenter (MVP). The MVP, an architectural software design pattern, facilitates automated unit tests as well as decoupling of the business logic, presentation logic and the graphical interface. Several models are implemented for analysing both elastic and quasi-elastic parts of the dynamical scattering function S(Q, ω) and intermediate scattering function I(Q, t). To understand the nature of dynamics in a QENS experiments, several models are also implemented for elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF) and jump diffusions. The interface has been validated by analysing a sample of liquid water at room temperature. The nature of hydrogen bond dynamics of the hydrogen bonded organic ferroelectric 2, 4, 5 − Br 3 imidazole, for the first time has been analysed using this newly implemented software. It is found that protons exhibit localised random motion in this material. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Mukhopadhyay S., Hewer B., Howells S., Markvardsen A.",2019,Scopus,10.1016/j.physb.2019.02.041,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063457137&doi=10.1016%2fj.physb.2019.02.041&partnerID=40&md5=f5ac31be08e3f7f702ca26115eff44e8
Differences between a static and a dynamic test-to-code traceability recovery method,"Recovering test-to-code traceability links may be required in virtually every phase of development. This task might seem simple for unit tests thanks to two fundamental unit testing guidelines: isolation (unit tests should exercise only a single unit) and separation (they should be placed next to this unit). However, practice shows that recovery may be challenging because the guidelines typically cannot be fully followed. Furthermore, previous works have already demonstrated that fully automatic test-to-code traceability recovery for unit tests is virtually impossible in a general case. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for this task, which is based on computing traceability links using static and dynamic approaches, comparing their results and presenting the discrepancies to the user, who will determine the final traceability links based on the differences and contextual information. We define a set of discrepancy patterns, which can help the user in this task. Additional outcomes of analyzing the discrepancies are structural unit testing issues and related refactoring suggestions. For the static test-to-code traceability, we rely on the physical code structure, while for the dynamic, we use code coverage information. In both cases, we compute combined test and code clusters which represent sets of mutually traceable elements.

The ELO substrate had low threading dislocation density (TDD) area and high TDD area which were alternately located with a period of 200 μm. The diodes located on the low TDD area showed higher breakdown voltages and lower on-resistances with small deviations compared with those located on high TDD area.

Exploring tools and strategies used during regular expression composition tasks,"Regular expressions are frequently found in programming projects. Studies have found that developers can accurately determine whether a string matches a regular expression. However, we still do not know the challenges associated with composing regular expressions. We conduct an exploratory case study to reveal the tools and strategies developers use during regular expression composition. In this study, 29 students are tasked with composing regular expressions that pass unit tests illustrating the intended behavior. The tasks are in Java and the Eclipse IDE was set up with JUnit tests. Participants had one hour to work and could use any Eclipse tools, web search, or web-based tools they desired. Screen-capture software recorded all interactions with browsers and the IDE. We analyzed the videos quantitatively by transcribing logs and extracting personas. Our results show that participants were 30% successful (28 of 94 attempts) at achieving a 100% pass rate on the unit tests. When participants used tools frequently, as in the case of the novice tester and the knowledgeable tester personas, or when they guess at a solution prior to searching, they are more likely to pass all the unit tests. We also found that compile errors often arise when participants searched for a result and copy/pasted the regular expression from another language into their Java files. These results point to future research into making regular expression composition easier for programmers, such as integrating visualization into the IDE to reduce context switching or providing language migration support when reusing regular expressions written in another language to reduce compile errors. © 2019 IEEE.","Bai G.R., Clee B., Shrestha N., Chapman C., Wright C., Stolee K.T.",2019,Scopus,10.1109/ICPC.2019.00039,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072335567&doi=10.1109%2fICPC.2019.00039&partnerID=40&md5=956a12727528dc2367f7174bf686dbcb
On the effectiveness of manual and automatic unit test generation: Ten years later,"Good unit tests play a paramount role when it comes to foster and evaluate software quality. However, writing effective tests is an extremely costly and time consuming practice. To reduce such a burden for developers, researchers devised ingenious techniques to automatically generate test suite for existing code bases. Nevertheless, how automatically generated test cases fare against manually written ones is an open research question.

A systematic evaluation of problematic tests generated by evosuite,"With the rapidly growing scale of modern software, the reliability of software systems has become essential. To ease the developers' pressure of writing unit tests manually, test generation tools such as EvoSuite and Randoop were proposed. Although these approaches have been shown to be able to automatically generate tests for achieving high coverage, the generated tests may be ineffective in detecting real faults. Particularly, these automatically generated tests may suffer from several problems (we call them problematic tests): (1) incorrect oracle. (2) unexpected exception/error. (3) flaky test. We present a comprehensive study of EvoSuite in Defects4j, and performed a detailed analysis of the reasons behind these automatically generated problematic tests. Our analysis identifies 528 problematic tests: 208 (39.4%) of them are caused by incorrect oracle, 319 (60.4%) are caused by unexpected exception/error, and one flaky test. © 2019 IEEE.",Fan Z.,2019,Scopus,10.1109/ICSE-Companion.2019.00068,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071868286&doi=10.1109%2fICSE-Companion.2019.00068&partnerID=40&md5=fad400c704eecd2746bc8f2835d8d4a7
Design of penta-band MIMO antenna for GPS/2G/3G/4G AND 5G NR applications,"In this paper a planar, MIMO antenna is proposed that can be integrated within wireless devices. The antenna is designed on FR-4 substrate with dielectric constant 4.4, thickness 1.6 mm and loss tangent 0.02. Ground plane of dimension 80 mm x 55 mm is selected for the final geometry. In order to improve the isolation between the identical antenna elements a T-shaped ground extension is designed. The proposed antenna is designed, simulated and optimized using IE3D simulation software. The five bands in which the antenna elements can resonate ranges from 700 MHz – 750 MHz, 1.47 GHz – 1.9 GHz, 2.04 GHz-2.26 GHz, 2.7 GHz-2.89 GHz, 3.2 GHz – 3.8 GHz and can support GPS, 2G, 3G, LTE TDD/FDD and 5G New Radio applications. Antenna characteristics regarding reflection coefficient, mutual coupling and radiation pattern in azimuth as well as elevation planes are discussed. Diversity performance is measured in terms of envelop correlation coefficient and is below 0.07 over all frequencies under consideration. The planar structure of the designed antenna provides an ease of fabrication. The ability to support multiple frequencies of different mobile communication generations makes the antenna fit to be integrated within future multi-generation compatible wireless devices. © BEIESP.","Biswas A., Gupta V.R.",2019,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067974652&partnerID=40&md5=34cc98b1bd1fed53d9889952ab3072be
Reducing stimulated emission threshold power density of AlGaN/AlN multiple quantum wells by nano-trench-patterned AlN template,"We investigate the crystal quality of epitaxy lateral overgrowth (ELOG) AlN layers and the performance of optical pumping AlGaN-based deep-ultraviolet laser diodes (LDs) on two different patterned AlN templates upon sapphire substrate. The full width at half maximum values of (0002) and (101¯2) X-ray diffraction rocking curves of the ELOG AlN layer on the nano-net-patterned AlN template are 76 and 306 arcsec, and the values of that on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template are 114 and 357 arcsec, respectively. Nevertheless, the threshold power density (Pth) of the 272-nm lasing from the multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template is 11% lower than that on the nano-net-patterned AlN template. The reason is that the continuous low threading dislocation density (TDD) MQWs zones above the ELOG coalescent areas upon trenched patterns are in parallel with the stimulated light emission direction. When light resonates through the continuous low TDD MQWs zones, it has higher optical gain and less non-radiative recombination than the case on the nano-net-patterned AlN template where the low TDD MQWs zones are discontinuous on the light path. The results indicate that not only the crystal quality but also the TDD distribution originated from the ELOG on the patterned templates have crucial influence on the Pth, and trench-patterned template can improve the performance of waveguide LDs with Fabry-Perot cavities. © 2018","Ni R., Chen X., Yan J., Zhang L., Guo Y., Wang J., Li J., Zhang Y.",2019,Scopus,10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.10.402,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056196694&doi=10.1016%2fj.jallcom.2018.10.402&partnerID=40&md5=105209fec312f7d788e30379d85ede59
Reaping the benefits of dynamic TDD in massive MIMO,"Recent advances in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication show that equipping base stations (BSs) with large antenna arrays can significantly improve the performance of cellular networks. Massive MIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance the average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time-division duplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) subframe configurations, is a promising enhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic TDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic patterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference among cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique characteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a marriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the limitation of dynamic TDD in macrocell (MC) networks. Specifically, we advocate that the benefits of dynamic TDD can be fully extracted in MC networks equipped with massive MIMO, i.e., the BS-to-BS interference can be effectively removed by increasing the number of BS antennas. We provide detailed analysis using random matrix theory to show that the effect of the BS-to-BS interference on UL transmissions vanishes as the number of BS antennas per user grows infinitely large. Last but not least, we validate our analysis by numerical simulations. © 2018 IEEE","Huang Y., Jalaian B., Russell S., Samani H.",2019,Scopus,10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829350,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048605021&doi=10.1109%2fJSYST.2018.2829350&partnerID=40&md5=68815079e01e518aaf7654e73abf3440
"Developer Testing in the IDE: Patterns, Beliefs, and Behavior","Software testing is one of the key activities to achieve software quality in practice. Despite its importance, however, we have a remarkable lack of knowledge on how developers test in real-world projects. In this paper, we report on a large-scale field study with 2,443 software engineers whose development activities we closely monitored over 2.5 years in four integrated development environments (IDEs). Our findings, which largely generalized across the studied IDEs and programming languages Java and C#, question several commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about developer testing: half of the developers in our study do not test; developers rarely run their tests in the IDE; most programming sessions end without any test execution; only once they start testing, do they do it extensively; a quarter of test cases is responsible for three quarters of all test failures; 12 percent of tests show flaky behavior; Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not widely practiced; and software developers only spend a quarter of their time engineering tests, whereas they think they test half of their time. We summarize these practices of loosely guiding one's development efforts with the help of testing in an initial summary on Test-Guided Development (TGD), a behavior we argue to be closer to the development reality of most developers than TDD. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Beller M., Gousios G., Panichella A., Proksch S., Amann S., Zaidman A.",2019,Scopus,10.1109/TSE.2017.2776152,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035777556&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2017.2776152&partnerID=40&md5=28882e3897d2337a56d975e15d347266
Automated critique of early programming antipatterns,"The introductory programming lab, with small cycles of teaching, coding, testing, and critique from instructors, is an extraordinarily productive learning experience for novice programmers. We wish to extend the availability of such critique through automation, capturing the essence of interaction between student and instructor as closely as possible. Integrated Development Environments and Automated Grading Systems provide constant feedback through static analysis and unit testing. But we also wish to tailor automated feedback to acknowledge commonly recurring issues with novice programmers, in keeping with the practice of a human instructor. We argue that the kinds of mistakes that novice programmers make, and the way they are reported to the novices, deserve special care. In this paper we provide examples of early programming antipatterns that have arisen from our teaching experience, and describe different ways of identifying and dealing with them automatically through our tool WebTA. Novice students may produce code that is close to a correct solution but contains syntactic errors; WebTA attempts to salvage the promising portions of the student's submission and suggest repairs that are more meaningful than typical compiler error messages. Alternatively, a student misunderstanding may result in well-formed code that passes unit tests yet contains clear design flaws; through additional analysis, WebTA can identify and flag them. Finally, certain types of antipattern can be anticipated and flagged by the instructor, based on the context of the course and the programming exercise; WebTA allows for customizable critique triggers and messages. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Ureel L.C., II, Wallace C.",2019,Scopus,10.1145/3287324.3287463,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064401275&doi=10.1145%2f3287324.3287463&partnerID=40&md5=afb504e0eabfd1cd51dae4d08cf37ca8
"Seasonal variability is not observed in the rates of high anti-A and anti-B titers in plasma, apheresis platelet, and whole blood units tested by different methods","BACKGROUND: ABO-incompatible platelet transfusions are common, and transfusions with ABO-incompatible plasma are increasing with the use of group A plasma and group O whole blood (WB) in emergencies. Many centers screen blood products for anti-A and/or anti-B titers to help prevent hemolysis from ABO-incompatible transfusions, yet titer methods and definition of high titers are not standardized. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This international multicenter study collected data on anti-A and anti-B titer practices for plasma, apheresis platelet (AP), and WB units from January 2015 through December 2017 to determine the prevalence of high-titer units using local definitions. RESULTS: A total of 87,701 plasma, AP and WB units were screened for high-titer anti-A and/or anti-B. High-titer detection rates for group A plasma ranged 0%–13.6%; group A AP 2.7%–9.3%; group O AP 2.3%–65.7%; and group O WB 6.4%–20.7%. At the one center that collected group B AP, the high-titer rate was 10.9%. High-titer rates varied from month to month, as well as between years for a given month. There was no clear pattern of when high-titer units were donated. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of high-titer plasma, AP, and WB units varies by titer method and local definition of high titer. Even at the lowest titer threshold of 50, a significant proportion of units had a high-titer antibody, although the clinical relevance of this finding needs further investigation. © 2018 AABB","Harm S.K., Yazer M.H., Bub C.B., Cohn C.S., Jacob E.K., Kutner J.M., Mair D.C., Raval J.S., Shaz B.H., Ziman A., Dunbar N.M., on behalf of the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) Collaborative",2019,Scopus,10.1111/trf.15083,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058217911&doi=10.1111%2ftrf.15083&partnerID=40&md5=41ab541da23e61c773170ac1b8972b4b
Epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN on nano-cavity patterned sapphire substrates,"The epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition using a nano-cavity patterned sapphire substrate (NCPSS) was investigated. The NCPSS, with a hexagonal non-close-packed nano-cavity pattern on the sapphire substrate, was fabricated by polystyrene sphere coating and size reduction by reactive ion etching, followed by deposition of alumina and thermal oxidation. The coalescence of GaN on the NCPSS was achieved by the formation of relatively large GaN islands and enhanced lateral overgrowth of the GaN islands over several nano-cavity pattern areas. The threading dislocation density (TDD) measured by cathodoluminescence measurement was significantly reduced from 2.4 × 108 cm−2 to 6.9 × 107 cm−2 by using the NCPSS. A dislocation behavior that contributes to the reduction of TDD of the GaN layer was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the compressive stress in the GaN layer was reduced by 21% due to the embedded nano-cavities. In addition, the diffuse reflectance of GaN on the NCPSS was enhanced by 54% ∼ 62%, which is attributed to the increased probability of light extraction through effective light scattering by nano-cavities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Lee D., Lee S., Kim G., Kim J., Jang J., Oh J., Moon D., Park Y., Yoon E.",2019,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2018.11.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056613097&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcrysgro.2018.11.001&partnerID=40&md5=7b7e8be160eb80523e3d0fdcb38a4f32
Introduction to Software Design with Java,"This textbook provides an in-depth introduction to software design, with a focus on object-oriented design, and using the Java programming language. Its goal is to help readers learn software design by discovering the experience of the design process. To this end, a narrative is used that introduces each element of design know-how in context, and explores alternative solutions in that context. The narrative is supported by hundreds of code fragments and design diagrams. The first chapter is a general introduction to software design. The subsequent chapters cover design concepts and techniques, which are presented as a continuous narrative anchored in specific design problems. The design concepts and techniques covered include effective use of types and interfaces, encapsulation, composition, inheritance, design patterns, unit testing, and many more. A major emphasis is placed on coding and experimentation as a necessary complement to reading the text. To support this aspect of the learning process, a companion website with practice problems is provided, and three sample applications that capture numerous design decisions are included. Guidance on these sample applications is provided in a section called “Code Exploration” at the end of each chapter. Although the Java language is used as a means of conveying design-related ideas, the book’s main goal is to address concepts and techniques that are applicable in a host of technologies. This book is intended for readers who have a minimum of programming experience and want to move from writing small programs and scripts to tackling the development of larger systems. This audience naturally includes students in university-level computer science and software engineering programs. As the prerequisites to specific computing concepts are kept to a minimum, the content is also accessible to programmers without a primary training in computing. In a similar vein, understanding the code fragments requires only a minimal grasp of the language, such as would be taught in an introductory programming course. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Robillard M.P.,2019,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-030-24094-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148840639&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-24094-3&partnerID=40&md5=cb1a736d2a51a3d9e1c1425acf4479cb
Lateral Load Resistance of a Novel Connection Detailing for Structural Wall-Floor Slab Joint Region,"The connection between shear wall and floor slab is an essential link in the lateral load resisting mechanism of slab-wall systems. By modifying the joint detailing pattern, performance of the connection under lateral loading can be improved to a great extent. For this purpose, novel ductile detailing with additional shear reinforcement in the joint core region has been proposed. This paper analyses some experimental results, relevant to three sub-assemblies' units tested under static lateral reverse cyclic loading, to evaluate the effect of the proposed joint detailing on the behavior of shear wall to floor slab joint region. Successively, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of the wall-slab joint sub-assembly were developed and analyzed using ABAQUS/CAE software. The provision of reinforcement in the core region of wall-slab joint for the construction of shear wall structures has been proven to be effective from the measured and computed results under cyclic loading. This paper thus verifies the viability of using the proposed type of joint detailing system in construction. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Salim S.R., Prabhakaran J.K.",2019,Scopus,10.1061/9780784482247.026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091980382&doi=10.1061%2f9780784482247.026&partnerID=40&md5=c93a704fadff90ebceea30faafa197dc

Implementation of demand response programs on unit commitment problem,"Peak electrical demand usually occurs in hot weather conditions due to the synchronous connection of the air-conditioners to local power grids. Hence, if a demand-side management (DSM) strategy is not applied on consumption patterns of customers, load-generation imbalance may lead to voltage collapse, cascaded outages, and catastrophic blackouts. This chapter presents a mathematical model for application of time-amount-based DSM program on a cost-based unit commitment problem in order to minimize the energy procurement cost. The ramp down/up rate limit, start-up and shutdown costs, generation capacity, minimum up- and downtimes, minimum and maximum time-dependent operating limits, and power balance criterion are considered as constraints. Simulations are conducted on a 10-unit test system and solved as a mixed integer nonlinear problem under general algebraic mathematical modeling system to find the optimum operating point of thermal units without and with implementation of a DSM strategic program. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Jabari F., Mohammadpourfard M., Mohammadi-Ivatloo B.",2019,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-030-32104-8_2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085458814&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-32104-8_2&partnerID=40&md5=6805e791a05bd37b966226d8ac5cea1e
Test Patterns for Cloud Applications,"Software systems are becoming graphical user intensive. They involve web technologies organized in the cloud platform which supports translation of services to a wider community. Such cloud applications are more vulnerable to misuse. Consequently, system development needs to focus on system security features in a comprehensive manner. Therefore, techniques that are based on test-driven development will be a good choice to use for the quality maintenance of such systems. We need checklists and mechanisms that provide identification and knowledge of best practices to maintain consistency in performing testing activities. We propose a test patterns-based technique which supports identification of test cases on the bases of specification and domain analysis of system under test. We provide a set of test patterns that support Test Driven Development (TDD) as well.

Characterization and comparison of: Re-Du-Ning aerosol particles generated by different jet nebulizers,"Inhalation therapy is the first-line therapy for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Re-Du-Ning inhalation solution (RIS) is an aerosol derivative from the Re-Du-Ning injection and has been clinically used to treat respiratory diseases like pneumonia for more than twenty years in China. However, the aerosolization and inhalation performances of RIS using different nebulizers have not been characterized, which may affect the therapeutic effects of RIS on respiratory diseases. We investigated the inhalation performances of RIS using five different nebulizers utilizing Spraytec, breath simulator of BRS 2000 and NGI techniques. We tested 5 different types of jet nebulizer, using RIS and an adult breathing pattern, to determine the difference in aerosol delivery over time. The particle size distribution of RIS was monitored by a Spraytec laser particle sizer. Fine particle fraction (FPF) and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) for RIS were measured using NGI. Aerosol deposited on the filter was analysed using HPLC. Nebulization time was much longer for the Pari Boy SX (red) nebulizer than for the other nebulizers, with the minimum delivery rate (DR) and the maximum total delivered dose (TDD) and total exhalation dose (TED). Nebulization time for Pari Boy SX (blue) was the lowest, with the highest DR and the lowest TDD and TED. Furthermore, the aerodynamic particle size of RIS was much larger for the Pari blue and Pari LC Plus than other nebulizers. Pari red produced the smallest aerodynamic particle size of RIS in these five nebulizers. In addition, a good linear relationship was found between MMAD and D50 in these five nebulizers. The results demonstrated that Pari Boy SX (red) delivered most slowly and produced the smallest aerodynamic particle size of the RIS aerosols, which may be applied to manage lower respiratory diseases. Moreover, Pari LC Plus and Pari Boy SX (blue) emitted quickly and generated larger aerodynamic particle size of RIS aerosols, which could be used to treat upper respiratory diseases. A good linear relationship between MMAD and D50 showed Spraytec could be a reliable technique for the development, evaluation and quality control of aerosol particles of inhalation solution preparations. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Zhang Y., Cheng B.C.-Y., Li C., Tao Y., Yu C., Liu X., Gao X., Luo G.",2019,Scopus,10.1039/c9ra06177k,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072750685&doi=10.1039%2fc9ra06177k&partnerID=40&md5=bacde678cdebfb6d179c83f195fb1069

Growth of GaN and improvement of lattice curvature using symmetric hexagonal SiO2 patterns in HVPE growth,"We implemented facet and flattening (FF) growth via hydride vapor phase epitaxy, and applied hexagonal SiO2 mask patterns to minimize the final threading dislocation density (TDD). We found that the FF growth technique with hexagonal masks significantly mitigates the lattice curvature.

Furthermore, TDD was significantly reduced to 6.8 × 105 cm-2.

Smart like a fox: How clever students trick dumb automated programming assignment assessment systems,"This case study reports on two first-semester programming courses with more than 190 students. Both courses made use of automated assessments. We observed how students trick these systems by analysing the version history of suspect submissions. By analysing more than 3300 submissions, we revealed four astonishingly simple tricks (overfitting, evasion) and cheat-patterns (redirection, and injection) that students used to trick automated programming assignment assessment systems (APAAS). Although not the main focus of this study, it discusses and proposes corresponding counter-measures where appropriate. Nevertheless, the primary intent of this paper is to raise problem awareness and to identify and systematise observable problem patterns in a more formal approach. The identified immaturity of existing APAAS solutions might have implications for courses that rely deeply on automation like MOOCs. Therefore, we conclude to look at APAAS solutions much more from a security point of view (code injection). Moreover, we identify the need to evolve existing unit testing frameworks into more evaluation-oriented teaching solutions that provide better trick and cheat detection capabilities and differentiated grading support.

Realization of low dislocation density AlN on a small-coalescence-area nano-patterned sapphire substrate,"Growth behaviors of AlN on hexagonal configuration hole-type and truncated-cone-pillar-type nano-patterned sapphire substrates (NPSSs) have been investigated. It is found that threading dislocation density (TDD) of AlN grown on the hole-type NPSS reaches 4.87 × 108 cm−2, which is over one order of magnitude lower than the value 6.63 × 109 cm−2 on the pillar-type one with the same period and mesa width. It is verified that the TDD of AlN grown on NPSSs is greatly dominated by the area ratio of the coalescence zones and thus the NPSS pattern with a small coalescence area (SCA) ratio is the preferred choice for high-quality AlN epitaxy. Benefiting from the low-TDD AlN grown on the hole-type NPSS with an SCA, the internal quantum efficiency of the 281 nm AlGaN-based multiple quantum wells has reached 73.9% at 300 K. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Xu F.J., Zhang L.S., Xie N., Wang M.X., Sun Y.H., Liu B.Y., Ge W.K., Wang X.Q., Shen B.",2019,Scopus,10.1039/C8CE01788C,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064080305&doi=10.1039%2fC8CE01788C&partnerID=40&md5=fae1c18cdd3849259c17425c23fa6cf0
Effect of continuous integration on build health in undergraduate team projects,"We present the results of an analysis of the changing patterns of build health across three cohorts of undergraduate students, in a compulsory software engineering course unit. In the course unit, student teams were asked to make changes to a large open source software system, and to maintain clean release builds as they did so. Release build health (in terms of compiling code and passing unit tests) was explicitly included in the marking scheme for the coursework. We set up a continuous integration server to keep track of student build health. Initially, this was used only by TAs in marking student work, but for later cohorts we provided access to continuous integration results to all students from the early stages of each exercise. This has provided us with data on the changing patterns of student build health, with differing access to the CI server, giving an insight into how students learn to manage build health and the effects of allowing them access to CI results. We found evidence of a clear improvement in ability to manage build health when CI facilities are made available, but that some student teams were not making use of the facilities to much effect. The improvement effect was strongest on the build health of release builds, corresponding to the area of greatest marks in the marking scheme. The CI results also proved to be very valuable for academic staff, in making the problems with student builds visible. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Embury S.M., Page C.",2019,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-030-06019-0_13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061092448&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-06019-0_13&partnerID=40&md5=5d306dbf64c28355a4c7a4c3a3d0ea44
Test data generation for mutation testing using genetic algorithm,"Mutation testing is a fault-based unit testing in which faults are detected by executing certain test data designed by any white box testing technique. This paper presents a hybridized method for path testing as well as mutation testing by generating the test data automatically using genetic algorithm. In the proposed approach, first path coverage-based test data is generated and further this data is exercised to cover all mutants present in the specific program under test. The proposed method can improve the testing efficiency by deleting the redundant test data obtained from the path testing in terms of better mutation score, and fault detection matrix is used to delete the duplicate data covering same mutants. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019","Mishra D.B., Mishra R., Acharya A.A., Das K.N.",2019,Scopus,10.1007/978-981-13-1595-4_68,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056266458&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-13-1595-4_68&partnerID=40&md5=1af00ef0bbfe208aa1abecb12abbefb7
Kalman Smoothing for Irregular Pilot Patterns; A Case Study for Predictor Antennas in TDD Systems,"For future large-scale multi-antenna systems, channel orthogonal downlink pilots are not feasible due to extensive overhead requirements. Instead, channel reciprocity can be utilized in time division duplex (TDD) systems so that the downlink channel estimates can be based on pilots transmitted during the uplink. User mobility affects the reciprocity and makes the channel state information outdated for high velocities and/or long downlink subframe durations. Channel extrapolation, e.g. through Kalman prediction, can reduce the problem but is also limited by high velocities and long downlink subframes. An alternative solution has been proposed where channel predictions are made with the help of an extra antenna, e.g. on the roof of a car, so called predictor antenna, with the primary objective to measure the channel at a position that is later encountered by the rearward antenna(s). The predictor antenna is not directly limited by high velocities and allows the channel in the downlinks to be interpolated rather than extrapolated. One remaining challenge here is to obtain a good interpolation of the uplink channel estimate, since a sequence of uplink reference signals (pilots) will be interrupted by downlink subframes. We here evaluate a Kalman smoothing estimate of the downlink channels and compare it to a cubic spline interpolation. These results are also compared to results where uplink channels are estimated through Kalman filters and predictors. Results are based on measured channels and show that with Kalman smoothing, predictor antennas can enable accurate channel estimates for a longer downlink period at vehicular velocities. The gaps in the uplink pilot stream, due to downlink subframes, can have durations that correspond to a vehicle movement of up to 0.75 carrier wavelengths in space, for Rayleigh-like non-line-of-sight fading. © 2018 IEEE.","Apelfrojd R., Bjorsell J., Sternad M., Phan-Huy D.-T.",2018,Scopus,10.1109/PIMRC.2018.8581030,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060554329&doi=10.1109%2fPIMRC.2018.8581030&partnerID=40&md5=21debc932728e4f5177d1fb7072581d2

Performance optimization of cell-free massive MIMO system with power control approach,"The cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system involves a large number of access points serving a smaller number of mobile users (MUs) over identical time/ frequency resource. By providing large number of service antennas closer to the MUs, the cell-free massive MIMO can offer great spectral efficiency, better macro-diversity and minimal path loss. Despite several advantages, the cell-free massive MIMO suffers from energy overloading caused by uncontrolled backhaul power consumption for large number of distributed access points (APs) and pilot contamination during channel estimation. In this paper, we have taken into consideration a cell-free massive MIMO system with APs equipped with multiple antennas performing time-division-duplex (TDD) operation. Here, all the APs coordinate through a constrained backhaul network for joint transmission of signals to all the users simultaneously by multiplying the received signal with the normalized conjugate of the estimated channel state information (CSI) and send back a rounded off version of the weighted pattern to the central processing unit (CPU). Finally, an effective user defined algorithm is presented involving selection and grouping of various APs based on their individual contributions for a particular MU to improve the overall performance of the system. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Panda S.,2018,Scopus,10.1016/j.aeue.2018.10.021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055138449&doi=10.1016%2fj.aeue.2018.10.021&partnerID=40&md5=28520e337dedb27e3d07e90957ad4a40
Improved grey wolf optimization technique for fuzzy aided PID controller design for power system frequency control,"Frequency regulation of power systems by fuzzy aided PID controller is proposed in this study. The controller gains are optimized by an Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO) method. The improvement in GWO method is done by an approach which does not consider less important delta wolves for updating the position vector in the hunting stages of the algorithm thus making the algorithm simpler with less implementation time. Proposed IGWO is initially evaluated using some standard test functions. The outcomes are equated with GWO, modified GWO (MGWO), Differential Evolution (DE), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques to illustrate its supremacy. The IGWO algorithm is then employed to optimize PID, hybridized structure of Fuzzy PD and cascade PI-PD(FPD/PI-PD) and fuzzy based PID parameters for frequency regulation of two-area power system. The superiority of fuzzy PID is established over recently proposed Automatic Generation Control (AGC) approaches. In the second stage, the methodology is applied to a two-area six-unit test system with diverse sources and supremacy of the proposed approach is established over optimal feedback controller, DE tuned PID and TLBO tuned 2DOF PID for the same test system. Finally, the suggested technique is used in a three area nonlinear test system and the supremacy of suggested approach over IGWO tuned FPD/PI-PD and hybrid Firefly Algorithm-Pattern Search (hFA–PS) tuned fuzzy PID is shown.

Should the last be first? Questions and dilemmas regarding early short-term insulin treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Introduction: Early short-term insulin treatment (STIT), defined as insulin administration shortly after diabetes diagnosis for only a brief period of time, is an alternative concept, aiming to entirely revise the perspective of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) management. Areas covered: The present review intends to summarize what is already known regarding early STIT in T2DM and highlight questions and dilemmas from the clinician’s point of view, with a discourse on future research agenda. Expert opinion: STIT has the potential to modify the natural history of T2DM, resulting in improved drug-free remission rates by favorably affecting the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Existing data in the field manifest significant weaknesses, mainly being the small number of trials and patients included, the lack of control groups in most studies and the wide heterogeneity between study designs and explored outcomes, which limit definitive conclusions. Therefore, before such a therapeutic strategy is incorporated into daily practice, important issues require further clarification by future trials. These issues include the optimal time point for the intervention, the ideal insulin type, the identification of patients being most likely to benefit, the STIT effects on cardiovascular and other clinical outcomes and the cost-effectiveness evaluation of this therapeutic strategy.

The same analysis approach: Practical protection against the pitfalls of novel neuroimaging analysis methods,"Standard neuroimaging data analysis based on traditional principles of experimental design, modelling, and statistical inference is increasingly complemented by novel analysis methods, driven e.g. by machine learning methods. While these novel approaches provide new insights into neuroimaging data, they often have unexpected properties, generating a growing literature on possible pitfalls. We propose to meet this challenge by adopting a habit of systematic testing of experimental design, analysis procedures, and statistical inference. Specifically, we suggest to apply the analysis method used for experimental data also to aspects of the experimental design, simulated confounds, simulated null data, and control data. We stress the importance of keeping the analysis method the same in main and test analyses, because only this way possible confounds and unexpected properties can be reliably detected and avoided. We describe and discuss this Same Analysis Approach in detail, and demonstrate it in two worked examples using multivariate decoding. With these examples, we reveal two sources of error: A mismatch between counterbalancing (crossover designs) and cross-validation which leads to systematic below-chance accuracies, and linear decoding of a nonlinear effect, a difference in variance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Görgen K., Hebart M.N., Allefeld C., Haynes J.-D.",2018,Scopus,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.083,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040764627&doi=10.1016%2fj.neuroimage.2017.12.083&partnerID=40&md5=313f121e577b6a5705e2f60a37a5d0a5
Application of multi-output Gaussian process regression for remaining useful life prediction of light emitting diodes,"Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are the preferred technology today when it comes to lighting both for indoor and outdoor applications, predominantly due to their high efficiency, environmental resilience and prolonged lifetime. Given their widespread use, there is a need to quickly qualify them and accurately predict the reliability of these devices. Due to their inherently long operational life, most LED reliability studies involve the use of degradation tests and application of filter-based prognostic techniques for dynamic update of degradation model parameters and estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL). Although they are in general very effective, the main drawback is the need for a specific state-space model that describes the degradation. In many cases, LED degradation trends are affected by a multitude of unknown factors such as unidentified failure modes, varying operational conditions, process and measurement variance, and environmental fluctuations. These variable factors that are hard to control tend to complicate the selection of a suitable state-space model and in some cases; there may not be a single model that could be used for the entire lifespan of the device. If the degradation patterns of LEDs under test deviate from the state space models, the resulting predictions will be inaccurate. This paper introduces a prognostics-based qualification method using a multi-output Gaussian process regression (MO-GPR) and applies it to RUL prediction of high-power LED devices. The main idea here is to use MO-GPR to learn the correlation between similar degradation patterns from multiple similar components under test and thereby, bypass the need for a specific state space model using available data of past units tested to failure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Duong P.L.T., Park H., Raghavan N.",2018,Scopus,10.1016/j.microrel.2018.07.106,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054821471&doi=10.1016%2fj.microrel.2018.07.106&partnerID=40&md5=0faf46add9ed248d541f033ffe136960
An Approach to Automatic Test Case Generation for Unit Testing,"In the paper, we propose a method to automatically generate test cases for the program with nested loops. Our approach first constructs the layer model of the program by scanning procedure source code. Then, through the method of model refinement, the layer model is converted to the extended regular expression model. Next, we can get a set of test paths from the extended regular expression model according to algebraic operations and constraint conditions in the program. Finally, test cases of the program are constructed by using logical operations for these test paths. Compared with those traditional graph-based test case generation methods, our method can produce a set of executable test cases to satisfy a given test coverage criterion without having to build the control flow diagram of the program in unit testing. In addition, our method can also effectively avoid the state space explosion problem. © 2018 IEEE.","Liu P., Xu Z., Ai J.",2018,Scopus,10.1109/QRS-C.2018.00097,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052527727&doi=10.1109%2fQRS-C.2018.00097&partnerID=40&md5=8c0fbbf0d72f13f421d182e4504e059b

A Graph Coloring Based Inter-Slice Resource Management for 5G Dynamic TDD RANs,"This paper studies the notion of network slicing in the emerging 5G Time Division Duplex (TDD) networks, considering different applications with diverse service requirements. The proposed solution relies on flexible slicing considering the entire spectrum band, wherein service oriented slices can independently adopt and adjust an UL/DL ratio reflecting traffic conditions. To this end, this paper initially describes and analyses the inter-slice resource allocation problem taking into account different TDD patterns, the slice traffic load and the inter-node interference, which originates by multiple and diverse sources. In this context, a graph-based framework is proposed to reduce the complexity of the problem by decoupling it in two sub-problems: the selection of TDD patterns to find which links should be activated at particular time instances and accordingly perform graph-based resource allocation for all slice traffic collectively.

Opportunistic interference mitigation for D-TDD in ultra-dense networks,"Dynamic time-division duplexing (D-TDD) is a promising solution to address the fast and varying traffic demands in ultra-dense networks (UDNs). However, in addition to conventional interference, the cross-link interference (CI) resulted by asymmetric uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission in D-TDD operation may further degrade system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic interference mitigation (OIM) framework to enhance D-TDD in UDNs by exploiting multi-user diversity in conjunction with interference-aware transmission. In particular, we first decompose the interference patterns experienced by D-TDD in a typical three- cell network, and propose novel interference alignment (IA) inspired opportunistic user scheduling and transmission schemes for each interference pattern. Our scheme mainly relies on the reference signal space (RSS) that guides the transmit beamforming and user scheduling to align the generated interference at a predefined subspace in each AP receiver with best effort. Numerical results show that our schemes can effectively mitigate the CI in D-TDD, and in conjunction with modified opportunistic IA for pure UL/DL transmission, our OIM framework achieves substantial performance again over the conventional schemes. © 2018 IEEE.","Xin Q., Gao H., Lv T.",2018,Scopus,10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403526,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050280841&doi=10.1109%2fICCW.2018.8403526&partnerID=40&md5=3bc673860e53a5166590f1e3fbba0dfe
Multi-beam multiple access scheme for uplink traffic of wireless virtual reality with millimeter-wave analog beamforming,"Wireless Virtual Reality (VR) is a new-arising technology to enable the untethered connection between VR server and VR client, whose traffic characteristics include both ultra-high data rate in downlink and periodic small-size data packets in uplink. The downlink requires ultra-wide bandwidth and hence leads to the usage of millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum with analog beamforming; however, this causes difficulty for the uplink: the efficient multiple access of small-packet users in the same mmWave carrier by time-division duplex (TDD). Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-beam multi-access scheme for the uplink traffic of multiple VR users with mmWave analog beamforming. Specifically, this scheme contains an analog beamforming weight determination function and a frequency-division user scheduling function, which are executed iteratively with the increasing number of selected users. Therein, the proposed multi-beam analog beamforming pattern generation method is able to generate arbitrary number of beams with flexible beam directions, beam widths and beamforming gain ratios, by the constant-modulus weights with one radio-frequency chain. It is demonstrated by the simulation results that the proposed multi-beam multi-access scheme increases 200% for the maximum number of simultaneously served VR uplink users than the traditional single-beam multi-access scheme in 5G systems with mmWave analog beamforming. © 2018 IEEE.","Huang M., Wang J., Zhang X.",2018,Scopus,10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403601,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050261393&doi=10.1109%2fICCW.2018.8403601&partnerID=40&md5=7cd0f33f636266235e1dd7c6b19376bb
Effects of recent temperature variability and warming on the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season in the northern Baltic Sea,"In cold climate regions, ice roads are engineered as temporary winter transportation routes on frozen lakes, rivers and seas. The ice road season start, end and duration principally depend upon ice thickness, which is controlled by surface air temperature (SAT) in terms of freezing and thawing degree-days (FDD and TDD, respectively). Both FDD and TDD are indicators of climate variability and change, and are naturally influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs). This study examined the role of ACPs in interannual variations in the operating season of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road in the Bay of Bothnia, northern Baltic Sea, during 1974–2009. Significant (p <.05) shortening in duration of the ice road season, mainly attributable to later start and earlier end days, was observed. In the Oulu-Hailuoto area, maximum ice thickness showed significant declines over time. This sea ice thinning was associated with SAT warming in cold months, manifested by statistically significant decreases in cumulative FDD during October–January within the water year (September–August). Significant increases in cumulative TDD during February–April, reflecting warmer SAT in mild months, resulted in earlier end day for the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season.

Random or evolutionary search for object-oriented test suite generation?,"An important aim in software testing is constructing a test suite with high structural code coverage, that is, ensuring that most if not all of the code under test have been executed by the test cases comprising the test suite. Several search-based techniques have proved successful at automatically generating tests that achieve high coverage. However, despite the well-established arguments behind using evolutionary search algorithms (eg, genetic algorithms) in preference to random search, it remains an open question whether the benefits can actually be observed in practice when generating unit test suites for object-oriented classes. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the effects of using evolutionary algorithms (including a genetic algorithm and chemical reaction optimization) to generate test suites, compared with generating test suites incrementally with random search. We apply the EVOSUITE unit test suite generator to 1000 classes randomly selected from the SF110 corpus of open-source projects. Surprisingly, the results show that the difference is much smaller than one might expect: While evolutionary search covers more branches of the type where standard fitness functions provide guidance, we observed that, in practice, the vast majority of branches do not provide any guidance to the search. These results suggest that, although evolutionary algorithms are more effective at covering complex branches, a random search may suffice to achieve high coverage of most object-oriented classes.

Multiple Testing for No Cointegration under Nonstationary Volatility,"With cointegration tests often being oversized under time-varying error variance, it is possible, if not likely, to confuse error variance non-stationarity with cointegration. This paper takes an instrumental variable (IV) approach to establish individual-unit test statistics for no cointegration that are robust to variance non-stationarity. The sign of a fitted departure from long-run equilibrium is used as an instrument when estimating an error-correction model. The resulting IV-based test is shown to follow a chi-square limiting null distribution irrespective of the variance pattern of the data-generating process. In spite of this, the test proposed here has, unlike previous work relying on instrumental variables, competitive local power against sequences of local alternatives in 1/T-neighbourhoods of the null. The standard limiting null distribution motivates, using the single-unit tests in a multiple testing approach for cointegration in multi-country data sets by combining P-values from individual units. Simulations suggest good performance of the single-unit and multiple testing procedures under various plausible designs of cross-sectional correlation and cross-unit cointegration in the data. An application to the equilibrium relationship between short- and long-term interest rates illustrates the dramatic differences between results of robust and non-robust tests. © 2017 The Department of Economics, University of Oxford and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Demetrescu M., Hanck C.",2018,Scopus,10.1111/obes.12214,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031704856&doi=10.1111%2fobes.12214&partnerID=40&md5=24cd56c48cef44e71da8b12e4db1487a
An empirical investigation on the readability of manual and generated test cases,"Software testing is one of the most crucial tasks in the typical development process. Developers are usually required to write unit test cases for the code they implement. Since this is a time-consuming task, in last years many approaches and tools for automatic test case generation-such as EvoSuite-have been introduced. Nevertheless, developers have to maintain and evolve tests to sustain the changes in the source code; therefore, having readable test cases is important to ease such a process. However, it is still not clear whether developers make an effort in writing readable unit tests. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct an explorative study comparing the readability of manually written test cases with the classes they test. Moreover, we deepen such analysis looking at the readability of automatically generated test cases. Our results suggest that developers tend to neglect the readability of test cases and that automatically generated test cases are generally even less readable than manually written ones. © 2018 ACM.","Grano G., Scalabrino S., Gall H.C., Oliveto R.",2018,Scopus,10.1145/3196321.3196363,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051650516&doi=10.1145%2f3196321.3196363&partnerID=40&md5=726f96bd52b3855098ad8fc22ad3edda

How Do Automatically Generated Unit Tests Influence Software Maintenance?,"Generating unit tests automatically saves time over writing tests manually and can lead to higher code coverage. However, automatically generated tests are usually not based on realistic scenarios, and are therefore generally considered to be less readable. This places a question mark over their practical value: Every time a test fails, a developer has to decide whether this failure has revealed a regression fault in the program under test, or whether the test itself needs to be updated. Does the fact that automatically generated tests are harder to read outweigh the time-savings gained by their automated generation, and render them more of a hindrance than a help for software maintenance? In order to answer this question, we performed an empirical study in which participants were presented with an automatically generated or manually written failing test, and were asked to identify and fix the cause of the failure. Our experiment and two replications resulted in a total of 150 data points based on 75 participants. Whilst maintenance activities take longer when working with automatically generated tests, we found developers to be equally effective with manually written and automatically generated tests. This has implications on how automated test generation is best used in practice, and it indicates a need for research into the generation of more realistic tests. © 2018 IEEE.","Shamshiri S., Rojas J.M., Galeotti J.P., Walkinshaw N., Fraser G.",2018,Scopus,10.1109/ICST.2018.00033,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048422287&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2018.00033&partnerID=40&md5=578e35239d4675a5780c9c04d97ca424
TDD pattern estimation and auto-recovery from estimation error for accommodations of fronthaul and secondary services in TDM-PON,"Time division multiplexing passive optical networks (TDM-PONs) are attracting attention as a cost-effective way of realizing mobile fronthaul (MFH), which is an optical link between a central unit (CU) and a distributed unit (DU) in a centralized radio access network (C-RAN). To realize an even more cost-effective network, we have studied the accommodation of MFH and secondary services in a single TDM-PON. We focus on the fact that a time division duplex (TDD) scheme will be applied to future radio access (FRA). Since a PON link is a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme, whereas a radio propagation link is a TDD scheme, unallocated intervals occur periodically in the PON link. For the above reason, we have already proposed a technique for estimating unallocated intervals in a TDD-based MFH link that involves prelearning based on a test signal transmission, and the signal of the secondary service is accommodated in the unallocated intervals. However, a scheme for recovering from an error when the estimation is wrong and the test signal is not transmitted has yet to be studied. This paper proposes an estimation technique without a test signal transmission and an estimation-error recovery scheme. The proposed estimator calculates the correlation coefficient between captured uplink traffic and the seven types of uplink and downlink ratio patterns standardized by the third generation partnership project (3GPP: http://www.3gpp.org/). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation technique by using a numerical simulation. The recovery scheme detects the estimation error and re-Allocates the bandwidth. We implement the estimator and the recovery scheme in a 10 Gigabit Ethernet PON (10G-EPON) prototype. We report the feasibility of the proposed scheme along with experimental results. © 2009-2012 OSA.","Hisano D., Uzawa H., Nakayama Y., Shimada T., Terada J., Otaka A.",2018,Scopus,10.1364/JOCN.10.000104,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042673341&doi=10.1364%2fJOCN.10.000104&partnerID=40&md5=acf2712da101fe4af2f90397a5d2d23d

On Policy Based RAN Slicing for Emerging 5G TDD Networks,"This paper introduces the concept of soft Policy based Slicing in the emerging 5G Time Division Duplex (TDD) networks, considering varying traffic conditions and asymmetric application usage patterns. The proposed approach relies on a flexible service-oriented slicing considering diverse applications with heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) demands in terms of throughput, latency, etc. It introduces a separate and customized Uplink-Downlink (UL-DL) pattern per slice taking into account the desired Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is mapped on to a QoS policy for facilitating slicing of the radio access resources. Such a QoS policy allows the flexible allocation of Resource Blocks (RBs) considering the entire spectrum for individual services, while a dynamic resource variation additionally allocates temporarily unused RBs to particular slices in need. The end-to-end system aspects considering the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network orchestration and management architecture are also discussed and an exhaustive simulation campaign is conducted to validate our proposals against the current state- of-the-art. © 2018 IEEE.","Shrivastava R., Samdanis K., Bakry A.",2018,Scopus,10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647358,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063449389&doi=10.1109%2fGLOCOM.2018.8647358&partnerID=40&md5=c6fe02635a1dcce0abdd0be8caab4fb5
A study of GaN nucleation and coalescence in the initial growth stages on nanoscale patterned sapphire substrates: Via MOCVD,"GaN growth on cone-shaped nanoscale patterned sapphire substrates (NPSS) in the initial stages was investigated via a series of growth interruptions. The thickness of the nucleation layer (NL) was optimized as 15 nm. A high-quality GaN film was achieved with an average surface roughness of 0.13 nm over 5 × 5 μm2, a threading dislocation density (TDD) of 1.80 × 108 cm-2 and a residual stress of 0.40 GPa. X-ray diffraction (XRD) ω/φ-scans, cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out to study the GaN coalescence process on NPSS. Nano-nucleating, lateral growth and the submerging of the large tilt grains were confirmed as the primary factors that reduced the TDD and residual stress. The mechanism for GaN nucleation on NPSS and its effect on the subsequent growth stages were elucidated. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Chen Y., Chen Z., Li J., Chen Y., Li C., Zhan J., Yu T., Kang X., Jiao F., Li S., Zhang G., Shen B.",2018,Scopus,10.1039/c8ce01450g,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055768145&doi=10.1039%2fc8ce01450g&partnerID=40&md5=79c4ab92e3876ae30e9eea19e37830d3

Queueing stability and CSI probing of a TDD wireless network with interference alignment,"This paper characterizes the performance in terms of queueing stability of a network composed of multiple MIMO transmitter-receiver pairs taking into account the dynamic traffic pattern and the probing/feedback cost. We adopt a centralized scheduling scheme that selects a number of active pairs in each time-slot. We consider that the transmitters apply interference alignment (IA) technique if two or more pairs are active, whereas in the special case where one pair is active point-to-point MIMO singular value decomposition (SVD) is used. We consider a time-division duplex (TDD) system where transmitters acquire their channel state information (CSI) by decoding the pilot sequences sent by the receivers. Since global CSI knowledge is required for IA, the transmitters have also to exchange their estimated CSIs over a backhaul of limited capacity (i.e. imperfect case). Under this setting, we characterize in this paper the stability region of the system under both the imperfect and perfect (i.e. unlimited backhaul) cases, then we examine the gap between these two resulting regions. Further, under each case we provide a centralized probing policy that achieves the max stability region. These stability regions and scheduling policies are given for the symmetric system, where all the path loss coefficients are equal to each other, as well as for the general system. For the symmetric system, we provide the conditions under which IA yields a queueing stability gain compared to SVD. Under the general system, the adopted scheduling policy is of a high computational complexity for moderate numbers of pairs, consequently we propose an approximate policy that has a reduced complexity but that achieves only a fraction of the system stability region. A characterization of this fraction is provided. © 2017 IEEE.","Deghel M., Assaad M., Debbah M., Ephremides A.",2018,Scopus,10.1109/TIT.2017.2748518,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029143716&doi=10.1109%2fTIT.2017.2748518&partnerID=40&md5=220860c32c516270f35b455029e0825b

High-Quality GaN Epilayers Achieved by Facet-Controlled Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth on Sputtered AlN/PSS Templates,"It is widely believed that the lack of high-quality GaN wafers severely hinders the progress in GaN-based devices, especially for defect-sensitive devices. Here, low-cost AlN buffer layers were sputtered on cone-shaped patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs) to obtain high-quality GaN epilayers. Without any mask or regrowth, facet-controlled epitaxial lateral overgrowth was realized by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The uniform coating of the sputtered AlN buffer layer and the optimized multiple modulation guaranteed high growth selectivity and uniformity of the GaN epilayer. As a result, an extremely smooth surface was achieved with an average roughness of 0.17 nm over 3 × 3 μm2. It was found that the sputtered AlN buffer layer could significantly suppress dislocations on the cones. Moreover, the optimized three-dimensional growth process could effectively promote dislocation bending. Therefore, the threading dislocation density (TDD) of the GaN epilayer was reduced to 4.6 × 107 cm-2, which is about an order of magnitude lower than the case of two-step GaN on the PSS. In addition, contamination and crack in the light-emitting diode fabricated on the obtained GaN were also effectively suppressed by using the sputtered AlN buffer layer. All of these advantages led to a high output power of 116 mW at 500 mA with an emission wavelength of 375 nm. This simple, yet effective growth technique is believed to have great application prospects in high-performance TDD-sensitive optoelectronic and electronic devices. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","He C., Zhao W., Zhang K., He L., Wu H., Liu N., Zhang S., Liu X., Chen Z.",2017,Scopus,10.1021/acsami.7b14801,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038216456&doi=10.1021%2facsami.7b14801&partnerID=40&md5=0382e52f35fc11bc041fe040860f26e3
Self-reflection and math performance in an online learning environment,"According to recent reports, K-12 full-time virtual school students have shown lower performance in math than their counterparts in brick-and-mortar schools. However, research is lacking in what kind of programmatic interventions virtual schools might be particularly well-suited to provide to improve math performance. Engaging students in self-reflection is a potentially promising pedagogical approach for supporting math learning. Nonetheless, it is unclear how models for math learning in brick and mortar classrooms translate in an online learning environment. The purpose of this study was to (a) analyze assessment data from virtual schools to explore the association between self-reflection and math performance, (b) compare the patterns found in student self-reflection across elementary, middle, and high school levels, and (c) examine whether providing opportunities for self-reflection had positive impact on math performance in an online learning environment. In this study, the self-reflection assessments were developed and administered multiple times within several math courses during the 2014-15 school year. These assessments included 4- 7 questions that asked students to reflect on their understanding of the knowledge and skills they learned in the preceding lessons and units. Using these assessments, multiple constructs and indicators were measured, which included confidence about the topic knowledge/understanding, general feelings towards math, accuracy of self-judgment against actual test performance, and frequency of self-reflection. Through a series of three retrospective studies, data were collected from full-time virtual school students who took three math courses (one elementary, one middle, and one high school math course) in eight virtual schools in the United States during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years. The results showed that (a) participation in self-reflection varied by grade, unit test performance level, and course/topic difficulty; (b) more frequent participation in self-reflection and higher self-confidence level were associated with higher final course performance; and (c) self-reflection, as was implemented here, showed limited impact for more difficult topics, higher grade courses, and higher performing students.

Towards Efficient Decoding of Multiple Classes of Motor Imagery Limb Movements Based on EEG Spectral and Time Domain Descriptors,"To control multiple degrees of freedom (MDoF) upper limb prostheses, pattern recognition (PR) of electromyogram (EMG) signals has been successfully applied. This technique requires amputees to provide sufficient EMG signals to decode their limb movement intentions (LMIs). However, amputees with neuromuscular disorder/high level amputation often cannot provide sufficient EMG control signals, and thus the applicability of the EMG-PR technique is limited especially to this category of amputees. As an alternative approach, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals recorded non-invasively from the brain have been utilized to decode the LMIs of humans. However, most of the existing EEG based limb movement decoding methods primarily focus on identifying limited classes of upper limb movements. In addition, investigation on EEG feature extraction methods for the decoding of multiple classes of LMIs has rarely been considered. Therefore, 32 EEG feature extraction methods (including 12 spectral domain descriptors (SDDs) and 20 time domain descriptors (TDDs)) were used to decode multiple classes of motor imagery patterns associated with different upper limb movements based on 64-channel EEG recordings. From the obtained experimental results, the best individual TDD achieved an accuracy of 67.05 ± 3.12% as against 87.03 ± 2.26% for the best SDD. By applying a linear feature combination technique, an optimal set of combined TDDs recorded an average accuracy of 90.68% while that of the SDDs achieved an accuracy of 99.55% which were significantly higher than those of the individual TDD and SDD at p < 0.05. Our findings suggest that optimal feature set combination would yield a relatively high decoding accuracy that may improve the clinical robustness of MDoF neuroprosthesis.

Saying 'Hi!' is not enough: Mining inputs for effective test generation,"Automatically generating unit tests is a powerful approach to exercise complex software. Unfortunately, current techniques often fail to provide relevant input values, such as strings that bypass domain-specific sanity checks. As a result, state-of-the-art techniques are effective for generic classes, such as collections, but less successful for domain-specific software. This paper presents TestMiner, the first technique for mining a corpus of existing tests for input values to be used by test generators for effectively testing software not in the corpus. The main idea is to extract literals from thousands of tests and to adapt information retrieval techniques to find values suitable for a particular domain. Evaluating the approach with 40 Java classes from 18 different projects shows that TestMiner improves test coverage by 21% over an existing test generator. The approach can be integrated into various test generators in a straightforward way, increasing their effectiveness on previously difficult-to-test classes. © 2017 IEEE.","Toffola L.D., Staicu C.-A., Pradel M.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/ASE.2017.8115617,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041446583&doi=10.1109%2fASE.2017.8115617&partnerID=40&md5=65e441b1913cc14081a84120f09edae5
Cannabis use by women during pregnancy does not influence infant DNA methylation of the dopamine receptor DRD4,"Background: Maternal cannabis use in pregnancy is linked with long-term adverse behavioral outcomes in offspring. Epigenetic processes established in utero that affect dopaminergic (reward) signaling may mediate risks. Associations between cannabis use and offspring DNA methylation have not been investigated; however, maternal tobacco smoking in pregnancy is associated with distinct patterns of DNA methylation at birth and beyond. Objectives: To determine whether maternal cannabis use is associated with methylation of the dopamine receptor gene DRD4 promoter in infants. Methods: Mothers in the Triple B study provided detailed information on drug use in each trimester of pregnancy. Buccal swabs were collected from neonates at 8 weeks (n = 804, 51.7% male, and 48.3% female). DRD4 promoter DNA methylation was measured using SEQUENOM MassARRAY. Results: Fifty-seven of the women in the study reported drug use during pregnancy, of whom 44 used cannabis. Of 19 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) units tested in DRD4, gestational cannabis use was associated with offspring methylation at 1 CpG unit in multivariate models (β + 1.48, CI: 0.02 to 2.93, and p = 0.047). At another site there was weak evidence that both cannabis and other drug use were independently associated with increased methylation, while the association with tobacco was in the reverse direction (cannabis use β + 0.67, CI: −0.12 to 1.46, and p = 0.09; other drug use β + 1.11, CI: 0.17 to 2.05, and p = 0.02; tobacco use β −0.41, CI: −0.85 to 0.03, and p = 0.07). None of the associations would remain significant after correction for multiple testing.

A typical cases of pinion vibration in parallel shaft turbo gear units,"Speed increasing parallel shaft double helical turbo gear units are commonly used in centrifugal compressors and high energy pump applications. Such turbo-gears are API 613 compliant (Titled as -Special Purpose Gear Units for Petroleum, Chemical, and Gas Industry Services) and have horizontal offset transmission line, with journal bearings on the high speed shaft and low speed shaft. When a full load full speed complete unit test is carried out, pinion dynamic behaviour is found to be different than what observed during full speed no load condition as mandated in API 613. During this test, gear box high speed pinion may show up with high vibration or combination of both during certain load and speed combination in spite of proper balancing and alignment. Since full load full speed test is kept as an option in API 613 , hence these type of vibration may not be detected during a no load test in gear box manufacturer's premises. These types of vibration patterns are not explicitly addressed in API 613. The first objective of this paper is to cover analytical, design and diagnostic aspects which can be helpful to mitigate above issues before it is towed out from manufacturer's premises. The second objective of the paper is to suggest installation /innovation / design modification on high speed pinion as a pre-emptive approach which can save time to mitigate if encountered during any certain speed -load combination. © 2018 COMADEM International.

A Framework of Temporal-Spatial Descriptors-Based Feature Extraction for Improved Myoelectric Pattern Recognition,"The extraction of the accurate and efficient descriptors of muscular activity plays an important role in tackling the challenging problem of myoelectric control of powered prostheses. In this paper, we present a new feature extraction framework that aims to give an enhanced representation of muscular activities through increasing the amount of information that can be extracted from individual and combined electromyogram (EMG) channels. We propose to use time-domain descriptors (TDDs) in estimating the EMG signal power spectrum characteristics; a step that preserves the computational power required for the construction of spectral features. Subsequently, TDD is used in a process that involves: 1) representing the temporal evolution of the EMG signals by progressively tracking the correlation between the TDD extracted from each analysis time window and a nonlinearly mapped version of it across the same EMG channel and 2) representing the spatial coherence between the different EMG channels, which is achieved by calculating the correlation between the TDD extracted from the differences of all possible combinations of pairs of channels and their nonlinearly mapped versions. The proposed temporal-spatial descriptors (TSDs) are validated on multiple sparse and high-density (HD) EMG data sets collected from a number of intact-limbed and amputees performing a large number of hand and finger movements. Classification results showed significant reductions in the achieved error rates in comparison to other methods, with the improvement of at least 8% on average across all subjects. Additionally, the proposed TSDs achieved significantly well in problems with HD-EMG with average classification errors of <5% across all subjects using windows lengths of 50 ms only. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Khushaba R.N., Al-Timemy A.H., Al-Ani A., Al-Jumaily A.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2687520,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032971509&doi=10.1109%2fTNSRE.2017.2687520&partnerID=40&md5=cdd7afb359c6da037a1bdb1fe5d36e9b
Fabrication of large flat gallium nitride templates with extremely low dislocation densities in the 106 cm−2 range by novel two-side hydride vapor-phase epitaxial growth,"Large GaN templates with high flatness (i.e., negligible wafer bowing and smooth as-grown surfaces) and low threading dislocation densities (TTDs) were fabricated by a novel two-side hydride vapor-phase epitaxial (HVPE) growth, beginning with deposition of polycrystalline GaN on the rear side of the wafer. Appropriate gas-flow management realized by our homemade HVPE system permitted the growth of a GaN layer with a smooth as-grown surface and excellent thickness uniformity on the front surfaces of 4- or 6-inch patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs). However, when the grown thickness exceeded 20 μm, single-side HVPE-growth induced fractures in GaN crystals. The fracture resistance of the GaN increased markedly when it was in a cleavage-resistant polycrystalline form (poly-GaN), permitting its growth to a thickness of 100 μm. In the presence of a back-side poly-GaN layer, extremely thick GaN crystal layers could be grown on the front side without fractures. An 80-μm-thick GaN template fabricated by two-side growth on a 4-inch PSS had a device-quality surface, negligible bowing, and low TDD (7 × 106 cm−2). Issues of high fabrication costs, unavailability of large-size wafers, and large off-angle variations associated with native GaN wafers could be overcome by using our high-quality GaN templates as alternative substrates. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fujikura H., Konno T.",2017,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2017.06.024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021678042&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcrysgro.2017.06.024&partnerID=40&md5=a01ee7cbda7973f5ee98f5376db6a8bd
Controller augmentation and test point insertion at RTL for concurrent operational unit testing,"Test point insertion methods to reduce the number of test patterns at register transfer level are required for the adaptability of traditional VLSI design flows and the reduction of time to search test point locations. In this paper, we propose a design-for-testability method at register transfer level to enable operational units as many as possible to be concurrently tested in scan testing. Using test point insertion and controller augmentation, the proposed design-for-testability method allocates input test registers and an output test register to inputs and an output of each operational unit in a data-path, respectively. Test compaction efficiency becomes high by enabling effective concurrent testing for operational units. Experimental results on high-level benchmark circuits show that our proposed method reduced the number of test patterns by 20% with 6.5 % area overhead on average. © 2017 IEEE.","Hosokawa T., Takeda S., Yamazaki H., Yoshimura M.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/IOLTS.2017.8046171,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032745114&doi=10.1109%2fIOLTS.2017.8046171&partnerID=40&md5=eca0e2d01ef908bcf3dc6cbfa3e6bd26
Numerical modeling of tubular daylighting devices,"Tubular daylighting device (TDD) or light pipe is an effective way of energy saving and has been found increasing acceptance for indoor lighting. This article presents a new method to evaluate the TDD's optical performance by the output luminous flux. The method is using position (α, d) and angular distribution of luminous flux (φ, θ, Φ) information to describe the optical properties of the TDD's light collecting cover. With the optical information, the ray tracing simulates the output luminous flux basing on the structural and reflectivity of the light pipe. Our method makes a complete optical description of light ray passing through a top cover, thus enable the subsequent ray tracing of light pipe. As an application, lambertian beam pattern is used as light source which goes through from the cover, and then the results on various length to diameter ratios of light pipes are compared. © 2017","Chen B., Wei Y., Li X., Cao R., Jin P.",2017,Scopus,10.1016/j.ijleo.2017.06.074,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025075452&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijleo.2017.06.074&partnerID=40&md5=89032ac5c027a48ace513a62e24ea23a
Groundwater discharge in high-mountain watersheds: A valuable resource for downstream semi-arid zones. The case of the Bérchules River in Sierra Nevada (Southern Spain),"Aquifers in permeable formations developed in high-mountain watersheds slow down the transfer of snowmelt to rivers, modifying rivers' flow pattern. To gain insight into the processes that control the hydrologic response of such systems the role played by groundwater in an alpine basin located at the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula is investigated. As data in these environments is generally scarce and its variability is high, simple lumped parameter hydrological models that consider the groundwater component and snow accumulation and melting are needed. Instead of using existing models that use many parameters, the Témez lumped hydrological model of common use in Spain and Ibero-American countries is selected and modified to consider snow to get a simplified tool to separate hydrograph components. The result is the TDD model (Témez-Degree Day) which is applied in a high mountain watershed with seasonal snow cover in Southern Spain to help in quantifying groundwater recharge and determining the groundwater contribution to the outflow. Average groundwater recharge is about 23% of the precipitation, and groundwater contribution to total outflow ranges between 70 and 97%. Direct surface runoff is 1% of precipitation. These values depend on the existence of snow. Results are consistent with those obtained with chloride atmospheric deposition mass balances by other authors. They highlight the important role of groundwater in high mountain areas, which is enhanced by seasonal snow cover. Results compare well with other areas. This effect is often neglected in water planning, but can be easily taken into account just by extending the water balance tool in use, or any other, following the procedure that has being developed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Jódar J., Cabrera J.A., Martos-Rosillo S., Ruiz-Constán A., González-Ramón A., Lambán L.J., Herrera C., Custodio E.",2017,Scopus,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.03.190,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016519310&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2017.03.190&partnerID=40&md5=152d751105b59f081f3d235a324fb274
Beamspace aware adaptive channel estimation for single-carrier time-varying massive MIMO channels,"In this paper, the problem of sequential beam construction and adaptive channel estimation based on reduced rank (RR) Kalman filtering for frequency-selective massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing single-carrier (SC) in time division duplex (TDD) mode are considered. In two-stage beamforming, a new algorithm for statistical pre-beamformer design is proposed for spatially correlated time-varying wideband MIMO channels under the assumption that the channel is a stationary Gauss-Markov random process. The proposed algorithm yields a nearly optimal pre-beamformer whose beam pattern is designed sequentially with low complexity by taking the user-grouping into account, and exploiting the properties of Kalman filtering and associated prediction error covariance matrices. The resulting design, based on the second order statistical properties of the channel, generates beamspace on which the RR Kalman estimator can be realized as accurately as possible. It is observed that the adaptive channel estimation technique together with the proposed sequential beamspace construction shows remarkable robustness to the pilot interference. This comes with significant reduction in both pilot overhead and dimension of the pre-beamformer lowering both hardware complexity and power consumption. © 2017 IEEE.","Guvensen G.M., Ayanoglu E.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/ICC.2017.7996672,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028353192&doi=10.1109%2fICC.2017.7996672&partnerID=40&md5=963bd8f2df20a7745e7ad32daf3ce6bb
Generating unit tests with descriptive names or: Would you name your children thing1 and thing2?,"The name of a unit test helps developers to understand the purpose and scenario of the test, and test names support developers when navigating amongst sets of unit tests. When unit tests are generated automatically, however, they tend to be given non-descriptive names such as ""test0"", which provide none of the benefits a descriptive name can give a test. The underlying challenge is that automatically generated tests typically do not represent real scenarios and have no clear purpose other than covering code, which makes naming them difficult. In this paper, we present an automated approach which generates descriptive names for automatically generated unit tests by summarizing API-level coverage goals. The tests are optimized to be short, descriptive of the test, have a clear relation to the covered code under test, and allow developers to uniquely distinguish tests in a test suite. An empirical evaluation with 47 participants shows that developers agree with the synthesized names, and the synthesized names are equally descriptive as manually written names. Study participants were even more accurate and faster at matching code and tests with synthesized names compared to manually derived names. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Daka E., Rojas J.M., Fraser G.",2017,Scopus,10.1145/3092703.3092727,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026658442&doi=10.1145%2f3092703.3092727&partnerID=40&md5=6c323432169921cdf656641a93914091

An industrial evaluation of unit test generation: Finding real faults in a financial application,"Automated unit test generation has been extensively studied in the literature in recent years. Previous studies on open source systems have shown that test generation tools are quite effective at detecting faults, but how effective and applicable are they in an industrial application? In this paper, we investigate this question using a life insurance and pension products calculator engine owned by SEB Life & Pension Holding AB Riga Branch. To study fault-finding effectiveness, we extracted 25 real faults from the version history of this software project, and applied two up-to-date unit test generation tools for Java, EVOSUITE and RANDOOP, which implement search-based and feedback-directed random test generation, respectively. Automatically generated test suites detected up to 56.40% (EVOSUITE) and 38.00% (RANDOOP) of these faults. The analysis of our results demonstrates challenges that need to be addressed in order to improve fault detection in test generation tools. In particular, classification of the undetected faults shows that 97.62% of them depend on either 'specific primitive values' (50.00%) or the construction of 'complex state configuration of objects' (47.62%). To study applicability, we surveyed the developers of the application under test on their experience and opinions about the test generation tools and the generated test cases. This leads to insights on requirements for academic prototypes for successful technology transfer from academic research to industrial practice, such as a need to integrate with popular build tools, and to improve the readability of the generated tests. © 2017 IEEE.","Almasi M.M., Hemmati H., Fraser G., Arcuri A., Benefelds J.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2017.27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026838407&doi=10.1109%2fICSE-SEIP.2017.27&partnerID=40&md5=453d4f6645bb7ba79856376c4eca884e
Disposable testing: Avoiding maintenance of generated unit tests by throwing them away,"Developers write unit tests together with programcode, and then maintain these tests as the program evolves. Sincewriting good tests can be difficult and tedious, unit tests canalso be generated automatically. However, maintaining these tests(e.g., when APIs change, or, when tests represent outdated andchanged behavior), is still a manual task. Because automaticallygenerated tests may have no clear purpose other than coveringcode, maintaining them may be more difficult than maintainingmanually written tests. Could this maintenance be avoided bysimply generating new tests after each change, and disposingthe old ones? We propose disposable testing: Tests are generatedto reveal any behavioral differences caused by a code change, and are thrown away once the developer confirms whetherthese changes were intended or not. However, this idea raisesseveral research challenges: First, are standard automated testgeneration techniques good enough to produce tests that may berelied upon to reveal changes as effectively as an incrementallybuilt regression test suite? Second, does disposable testing reducethe overall effort, or would developers need to inspect moregenerated tests compared to just maintaining existing ones? © 2017 IEEE.","Shamshiri S., Campos J., Fraser G., McMinn P.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/ICSE-C.2017.100,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026768542&doi=10.1109%2fICSE-C.2017.100&partnerID=40&md5=954731471c178ff17aa0d6552e089c3f
"A Large-Scale Study on the Usage of Testing Patterns That Address Maintainability Attributes: Patterns for Ease of Modification, Diagnoses, and Comprehension","Test case maintainability is an important concern, especially in open source and distributed development environments where projects typically have high contributor turn-over with varying backgrounds and experience, and where code ownership changes often. Similar to design patterns, patterns for unit testing promote maintainability quality attributes such as ease of diagnoses, modifiability, and comprehension. In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale study on the usage of four xUnit testing patterns which can be used to satisfy these maintainability attributes. This is a first-of-its-kind study which developed automated techniques to investigate these issues across 82,447 open source projects, and the findings provide more insight into testing practices in open source projects. Our results indicate that only 17% of projects had test cases, and from the 251 testing frameworks we studied, 93 of them were being used. We found 24% of projects with test files implemented patterns that could help with maintainability, while the remaining did not use these patterns. Multiple qualitative analyses indicate that usage of patterns was an ad-hoc decision by individual developers, rather than motivated by the characteristics of the project, and that developers sometimes used alternative techniques to address maintainability concerns. © 2017 IEEE.","Gonzalez D., Santos J.C.S., Popovich A., Mirakhorli M., Nagappan M.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/MSR.2017.8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026510051&doi=10.1109%2fMSR.2017.8&partnerID=40&md5=5e17bbdd3b0d41ca0e6141a97f266f93
A priori test coverage estimation for automated production systems: Using generated behavior models for coverage calculation,"Automated production systems need to be thoroughly tested. For this, the fully integrated system, consisting of software and hardware, is investigated for remaining bugs using system tests. Unlike unit tests, these tests involve human interaction with the system and are mostly performed manually, without any tool support for their simulation or adequacy examination. Thus, important functionality can be overlooked during testing, decreasing the overall system quality. Coverage measurement during testing can be a valuable support for assessing test adequacy, but requires instrumentation that might influence the real time behavior of the system. Further, test adequacy cannot be calculated until all tests have been executed. To tackle these problems, we propose an approach that aims at estimating coverage criteria prior to system test execution at the aPS and without instrumenting the code or defining hardware simulations. To this end, the nominal hardware behavior and human interaction models are derived from existing integration tests, enabling a priori estimation of the system test coverage via simulation of the software along with the deduced behavior. © 2017 IEEE.","Ulewicz S., Vogel-Heuser B., Simon H., Bohlender D., Obster M., Kowalewski S.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/ETFA.2017.8247704,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044463087&doi=10.1109%2fETFA.2017.8247704&partnerID=40&md5=82914b193f1e60125e2a5ce1e5c72d79
On the performance of practical ultra-dense networks: The major and minor factors,"In this paper, we conduct performance evaluation for Ultra-Dense Networks (UDNs), and identify which modelling factors play major roles and minor roles. From our study, we draw the following conclusions. First, there are 3 factors/models that have a major impact on the performance of UDNs, and they should be considered when performing theoretical analyses: i) a multi-piece path loss model with line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions; ii) a non-zero antenna height difference between base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs); iii) a finite BS/UE density. Second, there are 4 factors/models that have a minor impact on the performance of UDNs, i.e., changing the results quantitatively but not qualitatively, and thus their incorporation into theoretical analyses is less urgent: i) a general multi-path fading model based on Rician fading; ii) a correlated shadow fading model; iii) a BS density dependent transmission power; iv) a deterministic BS/user density. Finally, there are 5 factors/models for future study: i) a BS vertical antenna pattern; ii) multi-antenna and/or multi-BS joint transmissions; iii) a proportional fair BS scheduler; iv) a non-uniform distribution of BSs; v) a dynamic time division duplex (TDD) or full duplex (FD) network. Our conclusions can guide researchers to down-select the assumptions in their theoretical analyses, so as to avoid unnecessarily complicated results, while still capturing the fundamentals of UDNs in a meaningful way. © 2017 IFIP.","DIng M., Lopez-Perez D.",2017,Scopus,10.23919/WIOPT.2017.7959926,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026203247&doi=10.23919%2fWIOPT.2017.7959926&partnerID=40&md5=9e9f1bb858796e9e5810a72af676029a
Detecting bugs of concurrent programs with program invariants,"Concurrency bug detection is a time-consuming activity in the debugging process for concurrent programs. Existing techniques mainly focus on detecting data race bugs with pattern analysis; however, the number of interleaving patterns could be huge, only the most suspicious write-read pattern is given, and an oracle is needed, which is not available in the operational phase. This paper proposes a program-invariant-based technique to detect a class of concurrent program bugs. By unit testing of the components of a concurrent program, we obtain a set of program invariants, which can be used as an oracle to obtain ""bad"" invariants when the program is online. By using the function call graph of the components and applying a reduction technique to the invariants, we find the candidates of suspicious functions and rank them. From the interactions among components, we analyze the causes to the concurrency bugs. Experimental results show that our proposed technique is effective in concurrency bug detection. © 2017 IEEE.","Wang R., Ding Z., Gui N., Liu Y.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/TR.2017.2681107,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017092217&doi=10.1109%2fTR.2017.2681107&partnerID=40&md5=5c7804caf7a3c7a4a17777f4840f949d

Are There Any Unit Tests? An Empirical Study on Unit Testing in Open Source Python Projects,"Unit testing is an essential practice in Extreme Programming (XP) and Test-driven Development (TDD) and used in many software lifecycle models. Additionally, a lot of literature deals with this topic. Therefore, it can be expected that it is widely used among developers. Despite its importance, there is no empirical study which investigates, whether unit tests are used by developers in real life projects at all. This paper presents such a study, where we collected and analyzed data from over 70K revisions of 10 different Python projects. Based on two different definitions of unit testing, we calculated the actual number of unit tests and compared it with the expected number (as inferred from the intentions of the developers), had a look at the mocking behavior of developers, and at the evolution of the number of unit tests. Our main findings show, (i) that developers believe that they are developing more unit tests than they actually do, (ii) most projects have a very small amount of unit tests, (iii) developers make use of mocks, but these do not have a significant influence on the number of unit tests, (iv) four different patterns for the evolution of the number of unit tests could be detected, and (v) the used unit test definition has an influence on the results. © 2017 IEEE.","Trautsch F., Grabowski J.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/ICST.2017.26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020732498&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2017.26&partnerID=40&md5=1982dd57064be8a8f202fa420a68ffa7
Can the use of reconfigurable antennas overcome the CSI bottleneck for FDD massive MIMO?,"Massive MIMO has been proposed as a means of achieving huge spectral efficiency in cellular networks. However, its implementation is usually based on linear precoding schemes using Channel State Information (CSI). For this reason, the use of the Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode is typically assumed since it removes the dependence on the number of antennas at the transmitter to acquire CSI. Unfortunately, most of the cellular network operate in the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode in which the acquisition of CSI depends proportionally to the number of transmit antennas. For this reason, the implementation of Massive MIMO is handicapped to few transmit antennas for the current cellular networks. In this paper we study the use of reconfigurable antennas that can switch among a set of preset modes, i.e., radiation patterns, through Blind Interference Alignment schemes. We show that it is a solution to exploit a very large number of antennas at the transmit side, overcoming the bottleneck that today constitutes the acquisition of CSI in Massive MIMO systems operating in FDD mode. © 2017 IEEE.","Céspedes M.M., Plata-Chaves J., Armada A.G., Moonen M., Vandendorpe L.",2017,Scopus,10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925735,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019727677&doi=10.1109%2fWCNC.2017.7925735&partnerID=40&md5=b3530b6dd5235b482c108f5c7038881d
Associations between home insulin dose adjustments and glycemic outcomes at hospital admission,"Aims To describe patterns of home insulin dose adjustments for non-surgical, non-critically ill patients at admission and to describe associations between these adjustments and inpatient glycemic control. Methods Hospital records of non-critically ill patients treated with basal insulin prior to admission were identified. After exclusion of records in which a confounding factor influencing insulin dosing was present, 258 patient-admissions over a 3-year time period were included. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between adjustments to home insulin total daily dose (TDD) and inpatient glycemic control within the first 48 h, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results On hospital days 1 (HD1) and 2 (HD2), the home insulin TDD was reduced by 43.5% and 23.9%, respectively. Reductions in the home TDD ranging from 10% to 50% were not associated with normoglycemia or hyperglycemia, whereas increases ranging from 10% to 50% were associated with 2–5-fold increased odds of hyperglycemia. For patients with home insulin TDD ≥0.4 units/kg/day, a weight-based dose of 0.4–0.6 units/kg/day was associated with significantly higher odds of normoglycemia on HD2 (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.42–11.21) compared to lower doses. Conclusions Compared to less aggressive increases, home insulin dose increases ranging from 10% to 50% were associated with greater odds of hyperglycemia without increased odds of hypoglycemia during early hospitalization. Weight-based insulin dosing may be a preferred strategy for glycemic control among patients whose home TDD is ≥0.4 units/kg/day. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Khan S., Golden S.H., Mathioudakis N.",2017,Scopus,10.1016/j.diabres.2017.02.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015662702&doi=10.1016%2fj.diabres.2017.02.003&partnerID=40&md5=d4a058ad6b5fdbbb3de65bf798f8d5b0
Reduced dislocation density in GaxIn1−xP compositionally graded buffer layers through engineered glide plane switch,"In this work we develop control over dislocation glide dynamics in GaxIn1−xP compositionally graded buffer layers (CGBs) through control of CuPt ordering on the group-III sublattice. The ordered structure is metastable in the bulk, so any glissile dislocation that disrupts the ordered pattern will release stored energy, and experience an increased glide force. Here we show how this connection between atomic ordering and dislocation glide force can be exploited to control the threading dislocation density (TDD) in GaxIn1−xP CGBs. When ordered GaxIn1−xP is graded from the GaAs lattice constant to InP, the order parameter η decreases as x decreases, and dislocation glide switches from one set of glide planes to the other. This glide plane switch (GPS) is accompanied by the nucleation of dislocations on the new glide plane, which typically leads to increased TDD. We develop control of the GPS position within a GaxIn1−xP CGB through manipulation of deposition temperature, surfactant concentration, and strain-grading rate. We demonstrate a two-stage GaxIn1−xP CGB from GaAs to InP with sufficiently low TDD for high performance devices, such as the 4-junction inverted metamorphic multi-junction solar cell, achieved through careful control the GPS position. Experimental results are analyzed within the context of a model that considers the force balance on dislocations on the two competing glide planes as a function of the degree of ordering. © 2016","Schulte K.L., France R.M., McMahon W.E., Norman A.G., Guthrey H.L., Geisz J.F.",2017,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2016.11.050,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028275665&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcrysgro.2016.11.050&partnerID=40&md5=b33379fb0f7f6781008e9318ef2028b6

Analytical Evaluation of Saturation Throughput of a Cognitive WLAN Overlaid on a Time-Scheduled OFDMA Network,"In this paper, we analyze the saturation throughput of a cognitive WLAN overlaid on a primary OFDMA TDD network (e.g., LTE or WiMAX). In this scenario, after the contention among the secondary nodes, the winner node transmits its data packet in the empty resource blocks (RBs) of downlink and uplink subframes of the primary network. Regarding the OFDMA structure as well as time-scheduled resources in the primary network, the time duration of opportunities for the secondary network does not follow simple exponential on-off pattern. To model the dynamic behavior of opportunities for secondary nodes as well as contentions to exploit the opportunities, we propose an analytical model comprised of a discrete-Time Markov chain and two inter-related open multi-class queueing networks (QNs). The effects of the random number of empty resource blocks at different frames as the result of random amount of download and upload data, random packet transmission time at WLAN, the dependency of the number of empty RBs at consecutive frames, and the details of 802.11 MAC protocol are included in our analytical approach.

On Test Patterns for Cloud Applications,"Software testing is an important aspect for the quality of software. Different levels of experience, types of application and needs enforce differences in performing testing activity for same features of applications. Testing as an activity within a development house usually includes testing of recurrent situation e.g., testing of security features etc. Development of a homogeneous test ground requires considering information regarding the structure of real world scenarios. We propose a test pattern based technique which supports identification of test cases on the basis of specification and domain analysis. The proposed technique provides support for Test Driven Development (TDD) and Test Last Development (TLD). We provide test patterns for testing cloud applications where we study what features an application would bear and we propose what test cases must exist in the test suite for that application.

The design and implementation of Super Base Station side L1C system in TD-LTE pattern,"The Super Base Station project was proposed by the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The super base station of Centralized architecture can integrate multimode mobile communication system, save operator costs, reduce energy consumption, increase the transmission rate. The physical layer protocol has not explicitly stated the various states of physical layer as well as the interface with high-level in 3GPP LTE standard specification, so the physical layer control (L1C) solution was designed and implemented, mainly responsible for achieving high-level interactive information, data movement, and start physical channel. The physical layer baseband processing is based on TMS320TCI6618 multi-core DSP, where L1C system is located on core0, and core1, core2 are respectively used for processing uplink and downlink data signal. This article defines the three states of the physical layer, boot and other configuration scheduling process on the base station side is actualizes by state transition. When the subframe scheduling is going, through the multi-task scheduling and double buffering double pointer technology of the DSP, data storage and transfer is completed properly, and the startup and shutdown of different channels is completed according to different criteria.

Peculiar cases of pinion vibration in paralell shaft double helical gear units-identification and mitigation,"Speed increasing parallel shaft double helical gear units are commonly used in centrifugal compressors and high energy pump applications. Such turbo-gears are API 613 compliant (Titled as-Special Purpose Gear Units for Petroleum, Chemical, and Gas Industry Services) and have horizontal offset transmission line, with journal bearings on the high speed shaft and low speed shaft. When a full load full speed complete unit test is carried out, pinion dynamic behavior is found to be different than what observed during full speed no load condition as mandated in API 613 . During this test, gear box high speed pinion may show up with high vibration or combination of both during certain load and speed combination in spite of proper balancing and alignment. Since full load full speed test is kept as an option in API 613 , hence these type of vibration may not be detected during a no load test in gear box manufacturer's premises. These types of vibration patterns are not explicitly addressed in API 613 . The first objective of this paper is to cover analytical, design and diagnostic aspects which can be helpful to mitigate above issues before it is towed out from manufacturer's premises. The second objective of the paper is to suggest installation/innovation/design modification on high speed pinion as a pre-emptive approach which can save time to mitigate if encountered during any certain speed-load combination.",Bhattacharya M.,2017,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040126743&partnerID=40&md5=f3ae81ffbbcf60a8922791b6c21aea78

Magni - A framework for developing context-aware mobile applications,"The advent of Internet and ubiquitous technologies has been fostering the appearance of intelligent mobile applications aware of their environment and the objects nearby.

Opioid use for pain management after implementation of a medicaid short-acting opioid quantity limit,"BACKGROUND: The United States is currently experiencing an opioid abuse epidemic. Many policies and programs have been implemented at local, state, and national levels in an attempt to decrease prescription opioid addiction and overdose. On August 1, 2014, Colorado Medicaid implemented a policy change that limited the quantity of short-acting opioids (SAOs) that could be filled through the Medicaid benefit to no more than 4 tablets per day, or 120 tablets in 30 days. OBJECTIVE: To compare mean total daily dose (TDD) of opioids purchased by Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) Medicaid patients before and after implementation of the Medicaid SAO quantity limit. METHODS: This investigation used a pre/post study design to compare opioid use in Medicaid-eligible patients during the 90 days before implementation of the Medicaid quantity limit on August 1, 2014, and 90 days after full implementation of the change on December 31, 2014. The study was conducted at KPCO, an integrated care delivery system providing medical care for approximately 615,000 patients, of which over 54,000 are Medicaid members. Electronic medical and pharmacy records were used to identify patients and assess medication use. RESULTS: There was a small difference in opioid use in the population of Medicaid opioid users as evidenced by the median TDD of oral morphine equivalents (OME) purchased decreasing from 6.8 mg (IQR = 2.2-25.8) in the pre-implementation period to 6.6 mg (IQR = 1.7-24.0) in the postimplementation period (P = 0.027). The proportion of patients purchasing more than 120 mg OME per day and the proportion of patients purchasing long-acting opioids (LAOs) did not change significantly from the pre- to postimplementation period (OME > 120 of 4.2% vs. 3.6%, respectively, P = 0.290; LAO use of 12.9% vs. 13.6%, respectively, P = 0.465). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a statistically significant 3% decrease of 0.2 mg OME per day in the primary study population. A 24% reduction of 10 mg OME per day before and after implementation of the Medicaid SAO quantity limit was found in those patients identified as exceeding the Medicaid SAO quantity limit at baseline. These patients tended to be purchasing low to moderate total daily doses of opioids at baseline.","Riggs C.S., Billups S.J., Flores S., Patel R.J., Heilmann R.M.F., Milchak J.L.",2017,Scopus,10.18553/jmcp.2017.23.3.346,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013977283&doi=10.18553%2fjmcp.2017.23.3.346&partnerID=40&md5=519b375668b64369875b710e52f5b1ca
"Software quality assurance during implementation: Results of a survey in software houses from Germany, Austria and Switzerland","Context: Quality assurance performed during the implementation phase, e.g., by coding guidelines, static analysis or unit testing, is of high importance to ensure quality of software, but there is a lack of common knowledge and best practices on it. Objective: The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-practice of quality assurance during the implementation phase in software houses. Method: For this purpose, we conducted a survey in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where 57 software houses participated. The questionnaire comprised questions regarding techniques, tools, and effort for software quality assurance during implementation as well as the perceived quality after implementation. The results were complemented by interviews and results from other surveys on software quality in general. Results: Results from the survey show that the most common software quality assurance techniques used during implementation are unit testing, code reviews and coding guidelines. Most tool support is used in the areas of bug tracking, version control and project management. Due to relationships between the used tool types, it seems that the introduction of one tool leads to the adoption of several others. Also quality assurance techniques and tools are correlated. Bug fixing takes a significant ratio of the overall project effort assigned to implementation. Furthermore, we found that the more developers a software company has, the more effort is spent on bug fixing. Finally, more than half of all companies rated the quality after implementation as rather good to good.

Interference mitigation and traffic adaptation using cell clustering for LTE-TDD systems,"Dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) mode has been suggested to be used in LTE systems for small-sized cells with asymmetric traffic. Despite its flexibility, the TDD mode suffers from sophisticated interference patterns, i.e. mobile-To-mobile and Base station-To-Base Station interference. In order to solve this problem, the 3GPP has specified a set of methods for interference mitigation and traffic adaptation (IMTA). Cell clustering is one of these methods, where cells are organized in clusters. Inside each cluster, cells shall have the same frame configuration. The cells are assigned to clusters using specified rules that have to take into account interference levels and traffic asymmetry. In this paper, we propose methods for cell clustering in the context of IMTA.

How 'Specification by Example' and Test-Driven Development Help to Avoid Technial Debt,"This paper is an industrial experience report of applying the 'Specification by Example' methodology and test-driven development to the development of a core component of a healthcare product. The methods are mapped to the four quadrants of technical debt introduced by Martin Fowler in order to show how they can help to avoid the accumulation of technical debt.

Microbiological findings in burn patients treated in a general versus a designated intensive care unit: Effect on length of stay,"Background Infection is one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity in burn patients. The incidence and frequency of microbiological micro-organisms are known to vary across different models of intensive care units. To date, no study has attempted to describe the different findings in burn patients treated in an open, general intensive care unit (GICU) versus a dedicated burns intensive care unit (BICU). Only limited data is available on the effect of these microbiological micro-organisms on patients’ length of stay. Aim To characterize and compare the microbiological flora and antibiotic resistance patterns encountered in two different models of burn intensive care and to determine the effect of specific microbiological types on length of intensive care unit (ICU) and overall stay. Methods A retrospective case-control study of 209 burn patients treated in two highly specialized, Western burn referral centres between September 2009 and March 2014. Results 9710 culture results were analysed, of which 2590 (26.7%) yielded positive results (1537 in the GICU and 1050 in the BICU). Gram-positive cultures were more frequently found in the GICU, whereas Gram-negative and yeast cultures were more prevalent in the BICU. The most frequently encountered micro-organisms in both units were similar and included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Candida albicans. Significantly more resistant bacteria were detected in the BICU. Testing positive across all types of microbiological isolates, as well as for both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria significantly prolonged patient length of stay. This effect was even more pronounced if the micro-organisms were resistant to antimicrobial therapy. Conclusion There are notable differences in the microbiological isolate and antibiotic resistance patterns between burn patients treated in a GICU compared to a designated BICU. In both units, testing positive for resistant microbiological micro-organisms is significantly associated with longer hospital stay. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI","Issler-Fisher A.C., Fakin R.M., Fisher O.M., McKew G., Gazzola R., Rauch A.-K., Gottlieb T., Haertsch P., Guggenheim M., Giovanoli P., Maitz P.K.M.",2016,Scopus,10.1016/j.burns.2016.06.019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977655873&doi=10.1016%2fj.burns.2016.06.019&partnerID=40&md5=7c1396a70427b47c0883fc7ffbc6cc43
A quantitative analysis of the unit verification perspective on fault distributions in complex software systems: an operational replication,"Unit verification, including software inspections and unit tests, is usually the first code verification phase in the software development process. However, principles of unit verification are weakly explored, mostly due to the lack of data, since unit verification data are rarely systematically collected and only a few studies have been published with such data from industry. Therefore, we explore the theory of fault distributions, originating in the quantitative analysis by Fenton and Ohlsson, in the weakly explored context of unit verification in large-scale software development. We conduct a quantitative case study on a sequence of four development projects on consecutive releases of the same complex software product line system for telecommunication exchanges. We replicate the operationalization from earlier studies, analyzed hypotheses related to the Pareto principle of fault distribution, persistence of faults, effects of module size, and quality in terms of fault densities, however, now from the perspective of unit verification. The patterns in unit verification results resemble those of later verification phases, e.g., regarding the Pareto principle, and may thus be used for prediction and planning purposes. Using unit verification results as predictors may improve the quality and efficiency of software verification. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Grbac T.G., Runeson P., Huljenić D.",2016,Scopus,10.1007/s11219-015-9273-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925610743&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-015-9273-7&partnerID=40&md5=06a3c6fc1f779d20074176c121d7df1a

An empirical study to quantify the characteristics of Java programs that may influence symbolic execution from a unit testing perspective,"In software testing, a program is executed in hopes of revealing faults. Over the years, specific testing criteria have been proposed to help testers to devise test cases that cover the most relevant faulty scenarios. Symbolic execution has been used as an effective way of automatically generating test data that meet those criteria. Although this technique has been used for over three decades, several challenges remain and there is a lack of research on how often they appear in real-world applications. In this paper, we analyzed two samples of open source Java projects in order to understand the characteristics that may hinder the generation of unit test data using symbolic execution. The first sample, named SF100, is a third party corpus of classes obtained from 100 projects hosted by SourceForge. The second sample, called R47, is a set of 47 well-known and mature projects we selected from different repositories. Both samples are compared with respect to four dimensions that influence symbolic execution: path explosion, constraint complexity, dependency, and exception-dependent paths. The results provide valuable insight into how researchers and practitioners can tailor symbolic execution techniques and tools to better suit the needs of different Java applications. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Eler M.M., Endo A.T., Durelli V.H.S.",2016,Scopus,10.1016/j.jss.2016.03.020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963579194&doi=10.1016%2fj.jss.2016.03.020&partnerID=40&md5=2d61a22c9501a9cd021e7faa16cfad5a

In particular, we discuss our experience with encoding of definitional interpreters in Scala using case classes, pattern matching, and recursive functions; offering this material in the web-based learning management system WebLab; automated grading and feedback of interpreter submissions using unit tests; testing tests to force students to formulate tests, instead of just implementing interpreters; generation of tests based on a reference implementation to reduce the effort of producing unit tests; and the construction of a product line of interpreters in order to maximize reuse and consistency between reference implementations.","Van Der Lippe T., Smith T., Pelsmaeker D., Visser E.",2016,Scopus,10.1145/2998392.2998402,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85002125687&doi=10.1145%2f2998392.2998402&partnerID=40&md5=110c74e5e57139e7473713aed1b9f54c
Role of substrate quality on the performance of semipolar (11 2 - 2) InGaN light-emitting diodes,"We compare the optical properties and device performance of unpackaged InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emitting at ∼430 nm grown simultaneously on a high-cost small-size bulk semipolar (11 2 - 2) GaN substrate (Bulk-GaN) and a low-cost large-size (11 2 - 2) GaN template created on patterned (10 1 - 2) r-plane sapphire substrate (PSS-GaN). The Bulk-GaN substrate has the threading dislocation density (TDD) of ∼ and basal-plane stacking fault (BSF) density of 0 cm-1, while the PSS-GaN substrate has the TDD of ∼2 × 108cm-2 and BSF density of ∼1 × 103cm-1. Despite an enhanced light extraction efficiency, the LED grown on PSS-GaN has two-times lower internal quantum efficiency than the LED grown on Bulk-GaN as determined by photoluminescence measurements. The LED grown on PSS-GaN substrate also has about two-times lower output power compared to the LED grown on Bulk-GaN substrate. This lower output power was attributed to the higher TDD and BSF density. © 2016 Author(s).","Dinh D.V., Corbett B., Parbrook P.J., Koslow I.L., Rychetsky M., Guttmann M., Wernicke T., Kneissl M., Mounir C., Schwarz U., Glaab J., Netzel C., Brunner F., Weyers M.",2016,Scopus,10.1063/1.4963757,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989965947&doi=10.1063%2f1.4963757&partnerID=40&md5=90229d86cad12bc850081890507d20a8
Detecting Bugs of Concurrent Programs with Program Invariants,"Concurrency bug detection is a physical and time-consuming activity in the debugging process for concurrent programs. Existing techniques mainly focus on detecting data race bugs with pattern analysis, however, (1) the number of interleaving patterns could be huge, (2) only most suspicious write-read pattern is given, and (3) an oracle is needed which is not available in the operational phase. This paper proposes a program invariant based technique to detect a class of concurrent program bugs. By unit testing of some component of a concurrent program, we obtain a set of program invariants, which can be used as an oracle to get 'bad' invariants when the program is online. By building the function call graph of the component and applying reduction technique invariants, we compute the candidates of suspicious functions and rank them. From interactions among components, we can analyze the cause of concurrency bugs. Experimental results have shown that our proposed technique is effective in concurrency bug detection and cause analysis. © 2016 IEEE.","Ding Z., Wang R., Hu J., Liu Y.",2016,Scopus,10.1109/QRS-C.2016.67,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991780868&doi=10.1109%2fQRS-C.2016.67&partnerID=40&md5=0d60e9252c03fb3a2f75035f580d809a
Towards automatically generating descriptive names for unit tests,"During maintenance, developers often need to understand the purpose of a test. One of the most potentially useful sources of information for understanding a test is its name. Ideally, test names are descriptive in that they accurately summarize both the scenario and the expected outcome of the test. Despite the benefits of being descriptive, test names often fall short of this goal. In this paper we present a new approach for automatically generating descriptive names for existing test bodies. Using a combination of natural-language program analysis and text generation, the technique creates names that summarize the test's scenario and the expected outcome. The results of our evaluation show that, (1) compared to alternative approaches, the names generated by our technique are significantly more similar to human-generated names and are nearly always preferred by developers, (2) the names generated by our technique are preferred over or are equivalent to the original test names in 83% of cases, and (3) our technique is several orders of magnitude faster than manually writing test names. © 2016 ACM.","Zhang B., Hill E., Clause J.",2016,Scopus,10.1145/2970276.2970342,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84989184518&doi=10.1145%2f2970276.2970342&partnerID=40&md5=159b491c650ec21a84a8030b5b157772
Dislocation Reduction and Stress Relaxation of GaN and InGaN Multiple Quantum Wells with Improved Performance via Serpentine Channel Patterned Mask,"The existence of high threading dislocation density (TDD) in GaN-based epilayers is a long unsolved problem, which hinders further applications of defect-sensitive GaN-based devices. Multiple-modulation of epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) is used to achieve high-quality GaN template on a novel serpentine channel patterned sapphire substrate (SCPSS). The dislocation blocking brought by the serpentine channel patterned mask, coupled with repeated dislocation bending, can reduce the dislocation density to a yet-to-be-optimized level of ∼2 × 105 to 2 × 106 cm-2. About 80% area utilization rate of GaN with low TDD and stress relaxation is obtained. The periodical variations of dislocation density, optical properties and residual stress in GaN-based epilayers on SCPSS are analyzed. The quantum efficiency of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on it can be increased by 52% compared with the conventional sapphire substrate. The reduced nonradiative recombination centers, the enhanced carrier localization, and the suppressed quantum confined Stark effect, are the main determinants of improved luminous performance in MQWs on SCPSS. This developed ELOG on serpentine shaped mask needs no interruption and regrowth, which can be a promising candidate for the heteroepitaxy of semipolar/nonpolar GaN and GaAs with high quality. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","Ji Q., Li L., Zhang W., Wang J., Liu P., Xie Y., Yan T., Yang W., Chen W., Hu X.",2016,Scopus,10.1021/acsami.6b07044,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983516263&doi=10.1021%2facsami.6b07044&partnerID=40&md5=9ae762c0c1b6adeb8efc0a3dbee9b958
A Model-Based Approach for Product Testing and Certification in Digital Ecosystems,"In a growing number of domains, such as ambient-assisted living (AAL) and e-health, the provisioning of end-to-end services to the users depends on the proper interoperation of multiple products from different vendors, forming a digital ecosystem. To ensure interoperability and the integrity of the ecosystem, it is important that candidate products are independently tested and certified against applicable interoperability requirements. Based on the experience acquired in the AAL4ALL project, we propose in this paper a model-based approach to systematize, automate and increase the assurance of such testing and certification activities. The approach encompasses the construction of several models: a feature model, an interface model, a product model, and unit and integration test models. The abstract syntax and consistency rules of these models are specified by means of metamodels written in UML and Alloy and automatically checked with Alloy Analyzer. Using the model finding capabilities of Alloy Analyzer, integration tests can be automatically generated from the remaining models, through the composition and instantiation of unit tests. Examples of concrete models from the AAL4ALL project are also presented. © 2016 IEEE.","Lima B., Faria J.P.",2016,Scopus,10.1109/ICSTW.2016.22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992187849&doi=10.1109%2fICSTW.2016.22&partnerID=40&md5=3d2cbaa5de94fca6f2fd27698248fb77
Applying a Pairwise Coverage Criterion to Scenario-Based Testing,"Some scenario-based testing approaches propose to express a test suite as a regular expression (called scenario or pattern). It specifies a set of valid sequences of operations in a abstract way. When the regular expression is ""unfold"", test sequences are obtained. Usually, the unfolding is done in an exhaustive way, which can result in a combinatorial explosion. In this article, we explore a pairwise coverage criterion to select a subset of test sequences satisfying the pattern, in order to decrease the number of test sequences. The originality of the approach lies in the fact that the pairwise criterion is applied to the instantiated method calls (and not on the parameters). We applied this strategy to generate unit tests for Java classes. The quality of the test suites is evaluated with a mutation analysis and compared to test suites randomly generated. © 2016 IEEE.","Du Bousquet L., Delahaye M., Oriat C.",2016,Scopus,10.1109/ICSTW.2016.23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992187764&doi=10.1109%2fICSTW.2016.23&partnerID=40&md5=457502ff3bfd55c54e4b3aea487a56e3

However, the maintenance cost of the automatically generated tests presents a significant barrier to adoption of this technology. To address this challenge, we propose a novel technique for automated and fine-grained incremental generation of unit tests through minimal augmentation of an existing test suite.

"Unit Test Generation during Software Development: EvoSuite Plugins for Maven, IntelliJ and Jenkins","Different techniques to automatically generate unit tests for object oriented classes have been proposed, but how to integrate these tools into the daily activities of software development is a little investigated question. In this paper, we report on our experience in supporting industrial partners in introducing the EvoSuite automated JUnit test generation tool in their software development processes. The first step consisted of providing a plugin to the Apache Maven build infrastructure. The move from a research-oriented point-and-click tool to an automated step of the build process has implications on how developers interact with the tool and generated tests, and therefore, we produced a plugin for the popular IntelliJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE). As build automation is a core component of Continuous Integration (CI), we provide a further plugin to the Jenkins CI system, which allows developers to monitor the results of EvoSuite and integrate generated tests in their source tree. In this paper, we discuss the resulting architecture of the plugins, and the challenges arising when building such plugins.

On the diffusion of test smells in automatically generated test code: An empirical study,"The role of software testing in the software development process is widely recognized as a key activity for successful projects. This is the reason why in the last decade several automatic unit test generation tools have been proposed, focusing particularly on high code coverage. Despite the effort spent by the research community, there is still a lack of empirical investigation aimed at analyzing the characteristics of the produced test code. Indeed, while some studies inspected the effectiveness and the usability of these tools in practice, it is still unknown whether test code is maintainable. In this paper, we conducted a large scale empirical study in order to analyze the diffusion of bad design solutions, namely test smells, in automatically generated unit test classes. Results of the study show the high diffusion of test smells as well as the frequent co-occurrence of different types of design problems.

We obtained a number of results that can be summarized as follows: (i) applying TDD without knowing advanced unit testing techniques can be difficult; (ii) refactoring (one of the phases of TDD) is not done as often as the process requires; (iii) there is a need for live feedback to let developers understand if TDD is being applied correctly; and (iv) the usefulness of TDD hinges on task and domain to which it is applied to. © 2016 ACM.","Scanniello G., Romano S., Fucci D., Turhan B., Juristo N.",2016,Scopus,10.1145/2851613.2851778,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84975796948&doi=10.1145%2f2851613.2851778&partnerID=40&md5=974ec3ed5cebd1bf0dac861515b08fbb

Incorporating software performance engineering methods and practices into the software development life cycle,"In many software development projects, attention is only paid to performance concerns after functional testing, when it usually too late to remedy disabling performance problems. Early attention to performance concerns and early planning of performance requirements and performance testing can prevent debacles like the early rollout of healthcare.gov while addressing cross-cutting concerns such as scalability, reliability and, security. Performance engineering methods may be integrated into all phases of the software lifecycle, from the conception of a system to requirements specification, architecture, testing, and finally to production. Performance expectations can be managed by carefully specifying performance requirements. Reviewing the architecture of a system before design and implementation take place reduces the risk of designing a system that contains inherent performance vice. Performance modeling can be used to justify architectural and design decisions and to plan performance tests. The outputs of such performance tests enable us able to identify concurrent programming and other issues that would not be apparent in unit testing. Finally, risk is mitigated by avoiding design antipatterns that undermine scalability and performance. © 2016 ACM.",Bondi A.B.,2016,Scopus,10.1145/2851553.2858668,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969161544&doi=10.1145%2f2851553.2858668&partnerID=40&md5=77d0107949fcdda4845ca6f1bf0d6808
The design and physical characterization of a multileaf collimator for robotic radiosurgery,"A multileaf collimator (MLC) optimized for SBRT delivery with the CyberKnife® Robotic Radio-surgery System (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is described. The MLCisexchangeable with the alternate fixed and variable circular aperture collimator systems. The non-coplanar workspace is effectively equivalent for all three collimation types. The same range of tracking options, including real-time respiratory motion tracking, and the same toleranceonbeam pointing accuracy (≤0.95 mm) is maintained with all three collimation types. The MLC includes 52 flat-sided leaves, each of whichis 90 mmtall and projects 3.85 mm width atthe nominal treatment distance of800 mm SAD. The design allows 100% overtravel and unrestricted interdigitation. Leaf position is determined by primary motor encoders and ischecked withasecondary optical camera system. Maximum leakage, including inter-leaf and under the closed position leaf-tip gap was measured on five units to be ≤0.44%, while mean leakage and transmission ranged from 0.22%-0.25%. Leaf positioning accuracy measured over the full range of leaf positions, all robot and MLC orientations, and including variation with leaf motion direction and accumulated leaf motion after initialization had a mean error <0.2 mm, with 2%-98% range of ≤±0.5 mm(projectedat800 mmSAD) onthree units tested. The only factor found to effect leaf positioning accuracy was sag under gravity, which systematically altered leaf positions by 0.1 mm.

Do automatically generated unit tests find real faults? An empirical study of effectiveness and challenges,"Rather than tediously writing unit tests manually, tools can be used to generate them automatically - sometimes even resulting in higher code coverage than manual testing. But how good are these tests at actually finding faults? To answer this question, we applied three state-of-the-art unit test generation tools for Java (Randoop, EvoSuite, and Agitar) to the 357 real faults in the Defects4J dataset and investigated how well the generated test suites perform at detecting these faults. Although the automatically generated test suites detected 55.7% of the faults overall, only 19.9% of all the individual test suites detected a fault. By studying the effectiveness and problems of the individual tools and the tests they generate, we derive insights to support the development of automated unit test generators that achieve a higher fault detection rate. These insights include 1) improving the obtained code coverage so that faulty statements are executed in the first instance, 2) improving the propagation of faulty program states to an observable output, coupled with the generation of more sensitive assertions, and 3) improving the simulation of the execution environment to detect faults that are dependent on external factors such as date and time. © 2015 IEEE.","Shamshiri S., Just R., Rojas J.M., Fraser G., McMinn P., Arcuri A.",2016,Scopus,10.1109/ASE.2015.86,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84963828697&doi=10.1109%2fASE.2015.86&partnerID=40&md5=c84e8ab3ef9e6f6e58a4543fe0db5903
Achieving quality on software design through test-driven development,"Test-driven development (TDD) is a technique for developing and designing software where tests are created before production code in short cycles. There is some discussion in the software engineering community on whether TDD can really be used to achieve software quality. Some experiments were conducted in the last years comparing development by using TDD with one creating tests after the production code. However, these experiments always have some threats to validity that prevent researchers from reaching a final answer about its effects. This chapter, instead of trying to prove that TDD is more effective than creating tests after, investigates projects where TDD was successfully used, and presents recurrent and common practices applied to its context. A common mistake is to believe that just by creating tests before production code will make the application design ""just happens."" As with any other technique, TDD is not a silver bullet, and while it certainly helps to achieve some desirable characteristics in software, such as decoupling and separation of concerns, other practices should complement its usage, especially for architecture and design coherence. In this chapter, we dive deep in TDD practice and how to perform it to achieve quality in software design. We also present techniques that should be used to setup a foundation to start TDD in project and to refine the design after it is applied. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Rules of thumb to increase the software quality through testing,"The software maintenance typically requires 40-80% of the overall project costs, and this considerable variability mostly depends on the software internal quality: the more the software is designed and implemented to constantly welcome new changes, the lower will be the maintenance costs. The internal quality is typically enforced through testing, which in turn also affects the development and maintenance costs. This is the reason why testing methodologies have become a major concern for any company that builds - or is involved in building - software. Although there is no testing approach that suits all contexts, we infer some general guidelines learned during the Development of the Italian Single-dish COntrol System (DISCOS), which is a project aimed at producing the control software for the three INAF radio telescopes (the Medicina and Noto dishes, and the newly-built SRT). These guidelines concern both the development and the maintenance phases, and their ultimate goal is to maximize the DISCOS software quality through a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) workflow beside a continuous delivery pipeline. We consider different topics and patterns; they involve the proper apportion of the tests (from end-to-end to low-level tests), the choice between hardware simulators and mockers, why and how to apply TDD and the dependency injection to increase the test coverage, the emerging technologies available for test isolation, bug fixing, how to protect the system from the external resources changes (firmware updating, hardware substitution, etc.) and, eventually, how to accomplish BDD starting from functional tests and going through integration and unit tests. We discuss pros and cons of each solution and point out the motivations of our choices either as a general rule or narrowed in the context of the DISCOS project. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Java enterprise edition support in search-based JUnit test generation,"Many different techniques and tools for automated unit test generation target the Java programming languages due to its popularity. However, a lot of Java’s popularity is due to its usage to develop enterprise applications with frameworks such as Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) or Spring. These frameworks pose challenges to the automatic generation of JUnit tests. In particular, code units (""beans"") are handled by external web containers (e.g., WildFly and GlassFish). Without considering how web containers initialize these beans, automatically generated unit tests would not represent valid scenarios and would be of little use. For example, common issues of bean initialization are dependency injection, database connection, and JNDI bean lookup. In this paper, we extend the EvoSuite search-based JUnit test generation tool to provide initial support for JEE applications.

A two-fold quality assurance approach for dynamic knowledge bases: The 3cixty use case,"The 3cixty platform relies on a continuous integration workflow for the generation and maintenance of evolving knowledge bases in the domain of culture and tourism. This approach is inspired by common practices in the software engineering industry in which continuous integration is widely-used for quality assurance purposes. The objective of this paper is to present a similar approach for knowledge base population and publishing. The proposed approach consists of two main steps: (i) exploratory testing, and (ii) fine-grained analysis. In the exploratory testing step, the knowledge base is tested for patterns that may reveal erroneous data or outliers that could indicate inaccuracies. This phase is knowledge-base agnostic and provides inputs for the second phase. In the finegrained analysis step, specific tests are developed for a particular knowledge base according to the data model and pre-defined constraints that shape the data. More precisely, a set of predefined queries are executed and their results are compared to the expected answers (similar to unit testing in software engineering) in order to automatically validate that the knowledge base fulfills a set of requirements. The main objective of this approach is to detect and to flag potential defects as early as possible in the data publishing process and to eliminate or minimize the undesirable outcomes in the applications that depend on the knowledge base, typically, user interfaces that enable to explore the data but rely on a particular shape of the data. This two-fold approach proves to be critical when the knowledge base is continuously evolving, not necessarily in a monotonic way, and when real-world applications highly depend on it such as the 3cixty multi-device application.","Mihindukulasooriya N., Rizzo G., Troncy R., Corcho O., García-Castro R.",2016,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977569389&partnerID=40&md5=2369cce81852d3f696759f5e86038d1c
Generic approach for pattern matching with OpenCL,"Nowadays, applications must often handle a large amount of data and apply complex algorithms on it. It is a promising way to apply computations in parallel in order to meet the performance requirements. Since GPUs are designed to apply highly parallel tasks, using a CPU+GPU heterogeneous architecture has gained an increasing popularity in computation intensive applications. The paper presents a new generic GPGPU-based approach for pattern matching in graphs. The approach is part of a modeltransformation solution we are building. The solution is referred to as GPGPU-based Engine for Model Processing (GEMP). Building on top of the OpenCL framework, the computation is hardware and software platform independent in GEMP. The kernel code is generated at run-time based on the concrete pattern to be found. The generative solution allows us to optimize the code based on several aspects, e.g. the size of the pattern, the GPU device type, or the available memory. This new generic code approach is compared to a universal kernel code which can handle all kinds of patterns without any modification in the code. To verify the functional and non-functional requirements, the implementation is tested in two main steps using unit tests, and a real world case study. Evaluation of our measurements, performance and scalability results are described.

Web service test evolution,"In order to remain useful test scripts must evolve parallel to the test objects they are intended to test. In the approach described here the test objects are web services whose test script is derived from the web service interface definition. The test script structure is automatically generated from the WSDL structure with tags and attributes, however, the content, i.e. the test data has to be inserted by hand. From this script service requests are automatically generated and service responses automatically validated. As with other generated software artifacts, once the structure of the interface or the logic of the targeted service is changed, the content of the test script is no longer valid. It has to be altered and/or enhanced to fit the new interface structure and/or the altered service logic.

Effect of AlN buffer layer prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering on GaN-based LEDs,"AlN films were prepared on patterned sapphire substrates (PSS) by direct-current reactive magnetron sputtering (RMS) and used as buffer layers. The crystal quality and optical properties of GaN films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with AlN buffer layers were investigated. Compared with conventional low temperature GaN buffer layers, the RMS AlN buffer layers have smoother and smaller nucleation islands, which benefits the lateral growth and the coalesce of three-dimensional GaN islands. It is found that GaN-based LEDs with RMS AlN buffer layers have higher light output power, lower electric leakage and stronger electrostatic discharge(ESD) characteristic owning to the lower threading dislocation density (TDD). © 2015, SCIENCE PRESS.

Towards creating a GPGPU-accelerated framework for pattern matching,"Model-driven engineering (MDE) is a popular software development methodology in the software industry. Finding a predefined pattern in a domain-specific model can be requested in MDE. This technique can help in optimizing or refactoring the models or to translate from one language to another one. The goal of the current researching is to create a framework for MDE which can find patterns defined by the users. Performance is a key issue. Using heterogeneous computation system (e.g.: CPU+GPU) is a promising way to increase the performance of the calculation. Therefore, we created a solution based on the OpenCL framework which is one of the most popular heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, the new pattern matching framework and the main steps of its creation are presented. The applied conception consists of two main steps. Firstly, a simpler case study is solved and experiences are collected from the occurring challenges. Secondly, the achieved solution was extended for general pattern matching.

Compact Multiband Antenna for Handsets With a Conducting Edge,"This communication proposes a compact multiband antenna fed by microstrip coupling for handsets with conducting edge applications. The antenna is composed of a U-shaped loop, an inserted open-end T-shaped slot, and a feed line with a compact antenna area. Three types of resonant modes are excited, namely loop mode, slot mode, and monopole mode. Parametric studies have been performed. After the related parameters are controlled, the bandwidth of this antenna has the potential to cover the mobile bands of GSM (824-960 MHz), DCS (1710-1880 MHz), PCS (1850-1990 MHz), UMTS (1920-2170 MHz), LTE bands (FDD-LTE bands 1-10, 15, 16, 18-20, 22, 23, 25-27, and 30 and TDD-LTE bands 33-43). Good radiation characteristics, such as gain and radiation efficiency, are obtained with these operating bands. In addition, the structure of the inserted slot antenna reduced the user's hand effects on the radiation efficiency. © 2015 IEEE.","Hsu C.-K., Chung S.-J.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/TAP.2015.2473657,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946854774&doi=10.1109%2fTAP.2015.2473657&partnerID=40&md5=6d6b4fce0e81689ebd7f1923d1710154

Action recognition with trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptors,"Visual features are of vital importance for human action understanding in videos. This paper presents a new video representation, called trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD), which shares the merits of both hand-crafted features [31] and deep-learned features [24]. Specifically, we utilize deep architectures to learn discriminative convolutional feature maps, and conduct trajectory-constrained pooling to aggregate these convolutional features into effective descriptors. To enhance the robustness of TDDs, we design two normalization methods to transform convolutional feature maps, namely spatiotemporal normalization and channel normalization. The advantages of our features come from (i) TDDs are automatically learned and contain high discriminative capacity compared with those hand-crafted features; (ii) TDDs take account of the intrinsic characteristics of temporal dimension and introduce the strategies of trajectory-constrained sampling and pooling for aggregating deep-learned features. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: HMD-B51 and UCF101. Experimental results show that TDDs outperform previous hand-crafted features [31] and deep-learned features [24]. Our method also achieves superior performance to the state of the art on these datasets. © 2015 IEEE.","Wang L., Qiao Y., Tang X.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/CVPR.2015.7299059,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955282488&doi=10.1109%2fCVPR.2015.7299059&partnerID=40&md5=33a4701fe8fced836493e99b4385393b
Queueing stability and CSI probing of a TDD wireless network with interference alignment,"This paper characterizes the performance of IA technique taking into account the dynamic traffic pattern and the probing/feedback cost. We consider a TDD system where transmitters acquire their CSI (Channel State Information) by decoding the pilot sequences sent by the receivers. Since global CSI knowledge is required for IA, the transmitters have also to exchange their estimated CSIs over a backhaul of limited capacity. Under this setting, we characterize in this paper the stability region of the system and provide a probing algorithm that achieves the max stability region. In addition, we compare the stability region of IA to the one achieved by a TDMA system where each transmitter applies a simple ZF (Zero Forcing technique). © 2015 IEEE.","Deghel M., Assaad M., Debbah M.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/ISIT.2015.7282564,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969884482&doi=10.1109%2fISIT.2015.7282564&partnerID=40&md5=ea3feecab160f9211990cd17025cd71e
A threshold-based approach for joint active user selection and feedback in MISO downlink systems,"In this paper we study the downlink of a TDD (Time Division Duplex) single cell system where the Base Station (BS) employs multiple antennas to serve the users taking into account the traffic patterns. The BS chooses each slot the users to be active, and serves them using Zero Forcing (ZF) precoding. This requires the knowledge of the users' channels which is assumed to be performed e.g. via uplink training. Due to the channel acquisition overhead, only a subset of users must be active at each timeslot (depending on traffic patterns and channel states). In this paper, we develop an active user selection strategy where the base station sets a given threshold for the channel gain of the users. Then, only the users that have their channel gain higher than the threshold send their training sequence and are then considered to be served. The base station estimates the channel states of these users and, due to channel reciprocity, uses these channel states to transmit data via ZF precoding. With appropriate signaling and threshold selection, which adapt to the queuing behavior of the users, we prove that our proposed method achieves a larger stability region than the baseline centralized policy where the BS selects the users based on channel statistics and queue lengths. The performance of the threshold-based method is illustrated via simulations, where we can observe a tradeoff between the expansion of the stability region and delay performance. © 2015 IEEE.","Destounis A., Assaad M., Debbah M., Sayadi B.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/ICC.2015.7248762,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953748659&doi=10.1109%2fICC.2015.7248762&partnerID=40&md5=4c6b04bbc3ff14a34c125d87a91f2ea9
Dynamic time-domain duplexing for self-backhauled millimeter wave cellular networks,"Millimeter wave (mmW) bands between 30 and 300 GHz have attracted considerable attention for nextgeneration cellular networks due to vast quantities of available spectrum and the possibility of very high-dimensional antenna arrays. However, a key issue in these systems is range: mmW signals are extremely vulnerable to shadowing and poor high-frequency propagation. Multi-hop relaying is therefore a natural technology for such systems to improve cell range and cell edge rates without the addition of wired access points. This paper studies the problem of scheduling for a simple infrastructure cellular relay system where communication between wired base stations and User Equipment follow a hierarchical tree structure through fixed relay nodes. Such a systems builds naturally on existing cellular mmW backhaul by adding mmW in the access links. A key feature of the proposed system is that TDD duplexing selections can be made on a link-by-link basis due to directional isolation from other links. We devise an efficient, greedy algorithm for centralized scheduling that maximizes network utility by jointly optimizing the duplexing schedule and resources allocation for dense, relay-enhanced OFDMA/TDD mmW networks. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adapt to loading, channel conditions and traffic demands. Significant throughput gains and improved resource utilization offered by our algorithm over the static, globally-synchronized TDD patterns are demonstrated through simulations based on empirically-derived channel models at 28 GHz. © 2015 IEEE.","Ford R., Gómez-Cuba F., Mezzavilla M., Rangan S.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247068,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947810526&doi=10.1109%2fICCW.2015.7247068&partnerID=40&md5=e2bb236e885aade24a90ccfbc386390f
A centralized algorithm for dynamic TDD frame reconfigurations in synchronized HetNets,"Traffic demands of mobile radio network have been tremendously increasing in the recent years due to the enormous success of smartphones and their continuous feature evolution requiring higher data rates. Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consisting of low-power small cells underlying the existing macro cells represent the preferred solution to increase the capacity of cellular systems by means of spatial spectrum reuse. Static uplink/downlink time-division duplexing (TDD) configurations of existing networks cannot satisfy the varying traffic patterns of large number of small cells, which vary among cells and over time. In this paper we propose and evaluate a centralized algorithm for dynamic TDD frame configuration to which operates on a cluster-based cellular network, maximize the network throughput and preserving fairness. Our algorithm is characterized by only O(n log n) time complexity (with n cells in the network), which allows for instantaneous network-wise reconfigurations minimizing overhead. The algorithm is proven to be optimal and time efficient. Extensive simulation results using realistic application traffic have shown the superiority the proposed solution against static TDD configurations of LTE systems. Throughput improvements up to 43% as well as reductions in queued traffic at cells up to 52% are obtained using separate utility functions designed for throughput maximization and fairness respectively. © 2015 IEEE.","Nguyen K., Zappaterra L., Choi H.-A.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247164,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947796316&doi=10.1109%2fICCW.2015.7247164&partnerID=40&md5=ff5106332d513c8c3c97f289b9545577
Antenna Grouping Based Feedback Compression for FDD-Based Massive MIMO Systems,"Recent works on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have shown that a potential breakthrough in capacity gains can be achieved by deploying a very large number of antennas at the base station. In order to achieve the performance that massive MIMO systems promise, accurate transmit-side channel state information (CSI) should be available at the base station. While transmit-side CSI can be obtained by employing channel reciprocity in time division duplexing (TDD) systems, explicit feedback of CSI from the user terminal to the base station is needed for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. In this paper, we propose an antenna grouping based feedback reduction technique for FDD-based massive MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm, dubbed antenna group beamforming (AGB), maps multiple correlated antenna elements to a single representative value using predesigned patterns. The proposed method modifies the feedback packet by introducing the concept of a header to select a suitable group pattern and a payload to quantize the reduced dimension channel vector. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves significant feedback overhead reduction over conventional approach performing the vector quantization of whole channel vector under the same target sum rate requirement. © 2015 IEEE.","Lee B., Choi J., Seol J.-Y., Love D.J., Shim B.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2460743,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941216867&doi=10.1109%2fTCOMM.2015.2460743&partnerID=40&md5=5f1850505799e19b5bb2b5e60154b1ab
Increasing the efficiency of search-based unit test generation using parameter control,"Automatically generating test suites with high coverage is of great importance to software engineers, but this process is hindered by the vast amount of parameters the tools use to generate tests. Developers usually lack knowledge about the workings of the tools that generate test suites to set the parameters to optimal values, and the optimal values usually change during runtime. Parameter Control automatically adapts parameters during test generation, and has shown to help solve this problem in other areas. To investigate any improvements parameter control could have in search-based generation of test suites, we adapted multiple methods of controlling mutation and crossover rate in EvoSuite, a tool that automatically generates unit test suites. Upon evaluation, clear benefits to controlling parameters were found, but surprisingly, controlling some parameters can sometimes be more harmful to the search than beneficial through increased computation costs. © 2015 ACM.",White T.,2015,Scopus,10.1145/2786805.2807556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960386448&doi=10.1145%2f2786805.2807556&partnerID=40&md5=c11b57a2bf5b2858fe19a9def489a78f
Automated unit test generation for evolving software,"As developers make changes to software programs, they want to ensure that the originally intended functionality of the software has not been affected. As a result, developers write tests and execute them after making changes. However, high quality tests are needed that can reveal unintended bugs, and not all developers have access to such tests. Moreover, since tests are written without the knowledge of future changes, sometimes new tests are needed to exercise such changes. While this problem has been well studied in the literature, the current approaches for automatically generating such tests either only attempt to reach the change and do not aim to propagate the infected state to the output, or may suffer from scalability issues, especially when a large sequence of calls is required for propagation. We propose a search-based approach that aims to automatically generate tests which can reveal functionality changes, given two versions of a program (e.g., pre-change and post-change). Developers can then use these tests to identify unintended functionality changes (i.e., bugs). Initial evaluation results show that our approach can be effective on detecting such changes, but there remain challenges in scaling up test generation and making the tests useful to developers, both of which we aim to overcome. © 2015 ACM.",Shamshiri S.,2015,Scopus,10.1145/2786805.2803196,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960351014&doi=10.1145%2f2786805.2803196&partnerID=40&md5=f7326d166d030da2c7e53e281c5d8d08
Generating TCP/UDP network data for automated unit test generation,"Although automated unit test generation techniques can in principle generate test suites that achieve high code coverage, in practice this is often inhibited by the dependence of the code under test on external resources. In particular, a common problem in modern programming languages is posed by code that involves networking (e.g., opening a TCP listening port). In order to generate tests for such code, we describe an approach where we mock (simulate) the networking interfaces of the Java standard library, such that a search-based test generator can treat the network as part of the test input space. This not only has the benefit that it overcomes many limitations of testing networking code (e.g., different tests binding to the same local ports, and deterministic resolution of hostnames and ephemeral ports), it also substantially increases code coverage. An evaluation on 23,886 classes from 110 open source projects, totalling more than 6.6 million lines of Java code, reveals that network access happens in 2,642 classes (11%). Our implementation of the proposed technique as part of the EVOSUITE testing tool addresses the networking code contained in 1,672 (63%) of these classes, and leads to an increase of the average line coverage from 29.1% to 50.8%. On a manual selection of 42 Java classes heavily depending on networking, line coverage with EVOSUITE more than doubled with the use of network mocking, increasing from 31.8% to 76.6%. © 2015 ACM.","Arcuri A., Fraser G., Galeotti J.P.",2015,Scopus,10.1145/2786805.2786828,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960344128&doi=10.1145%2f2786805.2786828&partnerID=40&md5=8c85b9dfd91d1e92ced0d8652c8a4244
Does automated unit test generation really help software testers? A controlled empirical study,"Work on automated test generation has produced several tools capable of generating test data which achieves high structural coverage over a program. In the absence of a specification, developers are expected to manually construct or verify the test oracle for each test input. Nevertheless, it is assumed that these generated tests ease the task of testing for the developer, as testing is reduced to checking the results of tests. While this assumption has persisted for decades, there has been no conclusive evidence to date confirming it. However, the limited adoption in industry indicates this assumption may not be correct, and calls into question the practical value of test generation tools. To investigate this issue, we performed two controlled experiments comparing a total of 97 subjects split between writing tests manually and writing tests with the aid of an automated unit test generation tool, EVOSUITE. We found that, on one hand, tool support leads to clear improvements in commonly applied quality metrics such as code coverage (up to 300% increase). However, on the other hand, there was no measurable improvement in the number of bugs actually found by developers. Our results not only cast some doubt on how the research community evaluates test generation tools, but also point to improvements and future work necessary before automated test generation tools will be widely adopted by practitioners. © 2015 ACM.","Fraser G., Staats M., McMinn P., Arcuri A., Padberg F.",2015,Scopus,10.1145/2699688,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941555928&doi=10.1145%2f2699688&partnerID=40&md5=d57774da2f0237628fb52200fd5adee2
Validation of Concept of a Common Typical Time of Disease Duration for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Using Fisher Information Processing of Tumor Imaging Results Combined with Network Phenotyping Strategy Quantification of Individual Patient Clinical Profile Patterns,"A primary goal of current clinical cancer research is identification of prognostic tumor subtypes. It is increasingly clear that tumor growth depends on both internal tumor factors, and factors that are external to tumor, such as microenvironment. We recently showed that parameter values alone are less important than patterns of all patient parameters toger for identification of prognostic subtypes and have identified a network phenotyping strategy method to quantitatively describe dependency of tumor on environment, to characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtypes. We have also shown that information about tumor mass toger with patterns of or prognostic factors is related to survival. We now use a different patient cohort to validate this prognostic approach. A main finding is our identification of a common time of total disease duration (TDD) for every HCC patient. Clinical prognosis at time of baseline patient evaluation is n calculable as difference between TDD and time from disease onset to diagnosis (Tonset). We show that total pattern of all parameter values and differences in relationships between this pattern and a reference pattern that, toger with tumor mass, best reflects patient's prognosis at baseline. Our approach led us to identify 15 different composite HCC subtypes. Our results highlight nearly identical TDD in all patients, which must refore be a characteristic of HCC disease, as opposed to variable quantity of Tonset, which is impacted by multiple macro- and micro-environmental factors. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Pančoška P., Skála L., Nešetřil J., Carr B.I.",2015,Scopus,10.1053/j.seminoncol.2015.05.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940421603&doi=10.1053%2fj.seminoncol.2015.05.004&partnerID=40&md5=b7762084d1c78e13a67eb6ed36e7139d
Automated unit test generation during software development: A controlled experiment and think-aloud observations,"Automated unit test generation tools can produce tests that are superior to manually written ones in terms of code coverage, but are these tests helpful to developers while they are writing code? A developer would first need to know when and how to apply such a tool, and would then need to understand the resulting tests in order to provide test oracles and to diagnose and fix any faults that the tests reveal. Considering all this, does automatically generating unit tests provide any benefit over simply writing unit tests manually? We empirically investigated the effects of using an automated unit test generation tool (EVOSUITE) during development. A controlled experiment with 41 students shows that using EVOSUITE leads to an average branch coverage increase of +13%, and 36% less time is spent on testing compared to writing unit tests manually. However, there is no clear effect on the quality of the implementations, as it depends on how the test generation tool and the generated tests are used. In-depth analysis, using five think-aloud observations with professional programmers, confirms the necessity to increase the usability of automated unit test generation tools, to integrate them better during software development, and to educate software developers on how to best use those tools.

Random or genetic algorithm search for object-oriented test suite generation?,"Achieving high structural coverage is an important aim in software testing. Several search-based techniques have proved successful at automatically generating tests that achieve high coverage. However, despite the well-established arguments behind using evolutionary search algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms) in preference to random search, it remains an open question whether the benefits can actually be observed in practice when generating unit test suites for object-oriented classes. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the effects of using a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate test suites over generating test suites incrementally with random search, by applying the EvoSuite unit test suite generator to 1,000 classes randomly selected from the SF110 corpus of open source projects. Surprisingly, the results show little difference between the coverage achieved by test suites generated with evolutionary search compared to those generated using random search. A detailed analysis reveals that the genetic algorithm covers more branches of the type where standard fitness functions provide guidance. In practice, however, we observed that the vast majority of branches in the analyzed projects provide no such guidance. © 2015 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Shamshiri S., Rojas J.M., Fraser G., McMinn P.",2015,Scopus,10.1145/2739480.2754696,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960418726&doi=10.1145%2f2739480.2754696&partnerID=40&md5=9bf491609aed656dedb5434d0c0134ce
Achieving scalable mutation-based generation of whole test suites,"Without complete formal specification, automatically generated software tests need to be manually checked in order to detect faults. This makes it desirable to produce the strongest possible test set while keeping the number of tests as small as possible. As commonly applied coverage criteria like branch coverage are potentially weak, mutation testing has been proposed as a stronger criterion. However, mutation based test generation is hampered because usually there are simply too many mutants, and too many of these are either trivially killed or equivalent. On such mutants, any effort spent on test generation would per definition be wasted. To overcome this problem, our search-based EvoSuite test generation tool integrates two novel optimizations: First, we avoid redundant test executions on mutants by monitoring state infection conditions, and second we use whole test suite generation to optimize test suites towards killing the highest number of mutants, rather than selecting individual mutants. These optimizations allowed us to apply EvoSuite to a random sample of 100 open source projects, consisting of a total of 8,963 classes and more than two million lines of code, leading to a total of 1,380,302 mutants. The experiment demonstrates that our approach scales well, making mutation testing a viable test criterion for automated test case generation tools, and allowing us to analyze the relationship of branch coverage and mutation testing in detail. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Fraser G., Arcuri A.",2015,Scopus,10.1007/s10664-013-9299-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929522239&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-013-9299-z&partnerID=40&md5=843ecc3412b38b1cceeeab593a73d140

JSEFT: Automated javascript unit test generation,"The event-driven and highly dynamic nature of JavaScript, as well as its runtime interaction with the Document Object Model (DOM) make it challenging to test JavaScript-based applications. Current web test automation techniques target the generation of event sequences, but they ignore testing the JavaScript code at the unit level. Further they either ignore the oracle problem completely or simplify it through generic soft oracles such as HTML validation and runtime exceptions. We present a framework to automatically generate test cases for JavaScript applications at two complementary levels, namely events and individual JavaScript functions. Our approach employs a combination of function coverage maximization and function state abstraction algorithms to efficiently generate test cases. In addition, these test cases are strengthened by automatically generated mutation-based oracles. We empirically evaluate the implementation of our approach, called JSEFT, to assess its efficacy. The results, on 13 JavaScript-based applications, show that the generated test cases achieve a coverage of 68% and that JSEFT can detect injected JavaScript and DOM faults with a high accuracy (100% precision, 70% recall). We also find that JSEFT outperforms an existing JavaScript test automation framework both in terms of coverage and detected faults. © 2015 IEEE.","Mirshokraie S., Mesbah A., Pattabiraman K.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/ICST.2015.7102595,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84935095992&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2015.7102595&partnerID=40&md5=ee502ca81676c4e14a614ad7cb4d1bf2

Our approach is implemented in a tool called TESEM (Test Driven Secure Modeling Tool), which supports pattern applications by creating a script to execute model testing automatically.

Implementation of randomized test pattern generation strategy,Software testing involves running a piece of software on selected input data and checking the output for correctness. In order to test the software units randomized testing will be effective. Thoroughness depends on certain parameters settings like relative frequency on which the method are being called. This system that uses genetic algorithm for finding the parameters that optimize the test coverage of random unit testing. For designing the GA we have used the feature subset selection tool for accessing the content representation and the size within genetic algorithm. The proposed system ensures that all possibilities of errors in the code are randomly checked. It is an effective system to detect possibility of runtime errors. The randomized testing using genetic algorithm will call the test cases in a random manner. They will provide the inputs for testing also automatically and it starts testing by calling a test case of random length it will stop the working when it finds any error it can be viewed using minimization. It is faster than conventional testing methods and it is effective in finding the error in the code effectively. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

Improved single-stream beamforming algorithm in TD-LTE system,"Beamforming (BF) is a pre-signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. It produces directional BF by adjusting the weighted coefficient of each array element to obtain obvious array gain. At present, the most common BF algorithms are eigen-based Beamfirming (EBB) algorithm and grid of beam (GOB) algorithm, but these two algorithms still have some defects. Therefore, this paper thoroughly illustrates EBB and GOB algorithms and respectively presents the corresponding improvements. On the one hand, this article proposes a modified EBB algorithm which only adaptively changes phase pattern to reduce the impact on the amplitude of the original signal, thus decreases the power loss. On the other hand, this paper puts forward an improved GOB algorithm which adds the correlation factors of the antennas with different polarization at the same physical position to increase BF gain. The performances of improved and original BF algorithms are simulated in a platform of TD-LTE. The simulation result shows that BLER performances of two enhanced BF algorithms are better than corresponding traditional algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.","Liu Y., Liu H., Jia T., Wang T.",2015,Scopus,10.1109/CSE.2014.95,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925252196&doi=10.1109%2fCSE.2014.95&partnerID=40&md5=0595ba7505333c404464ccc0a84bd42d
Epitaxial lateral overgrowth of AlN on self-assembled patterned nanorods,"We report an inexpensive nanoscale patterning process for epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) in AlN layers grown by metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on sapphire. The pattern was produced by an inductively coupled plasma etch using a self-assembled monolayer of silica spheres on AlN as the lithographic mask. The resulting uniform 1 μm length rod structure across a wafer showed a massive reduction in threading dislocations (TDs) when annealed at 1100 °C. Overgrowing homoepitaxial AlN on top of the nanorods, at a temperature of 1100 °C, produced a crack free coalesced film with approximately 4 μm of growth, which is formed at a much lower temperature compared to that typically required for microscale ELOG. The improved crystal quality, in terms of TD reduction, of the AlN above the rods was determined by detailed weak beam (WB) electron microscopy studies and showed that the threading dislocation density (TDD) was greatly reduced, by approximately two orders of magnitude in the case for edge-type dislocations. In situ reflectance measurements during the overgrowth allowed for thickness coalescence to be estimated along with wafer curvature changes. The in situ measurements also confirmed that tensile strain built up at a much slower rate in the ELOG AlN layer compared to that of AlN prepared directly on sapphire.

Integrating formal methods with Model-Driven engineering,"This paper presents the initial exploration work and proposal for our research to integrate formal methods with model-driven engineering. An extensive literature exists with the goal of facilitating the adoption of formal methods for educational and industrial practices, yet its adoption for teaching introductory software engineering courses and analyzing critical software systems in the industry is poor. The goal of this research is to provide an easy-to-use approach for using formal methods for industrial and academic purposes. Our approach is based on generating formal representations of static and dynamic abstractions of software expressed in a textual language, called Umple, which is derived from UML. To enrich the modeling experience, we adopt a pattern-based approach to specify various object-oriented and transition patterns. To maintain scalability of the dynamic aspects, we adopted a compositional approach to integrate hierarchical systems. To ensure correctness of our approach, we have adopted simulation and rigorous test-driven development methodologies. Current results have demonstrated that the constraints and generated formal methods code represent the patterns faithfully.",Adesina O.O.,2015,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962212406&partnerID=40&md5=82fe48a49337d5a032488a82e4425ecd
Generating readable unit tests for Guava,"Unit tests for object-oriented classes can be generated automatically using search-based testing techniques. As the search algorithms are typically guided by structural coverage criteria, the resulting unit tests are often long and confusing, with possible negative implications for developer adoption of such test generation tools, and the difficulty of the test oracle problem and test maintenance. To counter this problem, we integrate a further optimization target based on a model of test readability learned from human annotation data. We demonstrate on a selection of classes from the Guava library how this approach produces more readable unit tests without loss of coverage. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Daka E., Campos J., Dorn J., Fraser G., Weimer W.",2015,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-319-22183-0_17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84951310640&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-22183-0_17&partnerID=40&md5=f7b79cb1a85b5a0ed6f4ac79b87016c9
Parameter control in search-based generation of unit test suites,"Search-based testing supports developers by automatically generating test suites with high coverage, but the effectiveness of a search-based test generator depends on numerous parameters. It is unreasonable to expect developers to understand search algorithms well enough to find the optimal parameter settings for a problem at hand, and even if they did, a static value for a parameter can be suboptimal at any given point during the search. To counter this problem, parameter control methods have been devised to automatically determine and adapt parameter values throughout the search. To investigate whether parameter control methods can also improve search-based generation of test suites, we have implemented and evaluated different methods to control the crossover and mutation rate in the EVOSUITE unit test generation tool. Evaluation on a selection of open source Java classes reveals that while parameter control improves the values of mutation and crossover rate successfully during runtime, the positive effects of this improvement are often countered by increased costs of fitness evaluation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Paterson D., Turner J., White T., Fraser G.",2015,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-319-22183-0_10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84951291034&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-22183-0_10&partnerID=40&md5=ae1d051fc21ad286864deaaf9f083c51
Memory management test-case generation of C programs using bounded model checking,"We describe a novel method to automatically generate and verify memory management test cases for unit tests, which are based on assertions extracted from safety properties typically generated by bounded model checking (BMC) tools. In particular, the proposed method checks for properties related to pointer safety, memory leaks, and invalid deallocation. To investigate our method’s effectiveness, we developed a tool called Map2Check that adopts the ESBMC model checker and the CUnit testing framework. Additionally, Map2Check provides an integration of BMC tools with unit testing frameworks, which helps developers not very familiar with formal methods to verify large C programs. We use Map2Check to perform an empirical evaluation over publicly available benchmarks and compare the results to recognized tools, e.g., Valgrind’s Memcheck, CBMC, LLBMC, CPA Checker, Predator, and ESBMC. Experimental results show that our proposed method detects at least as many memory management defects as existing tools; and it does not report any false positive and negative. We compared Map2Check with tools on the Competition on Software Verification 2014 (SVCOMP), in the Memory Safety category. Map2Check would have the same score than the 1st place and it would win the 2st place when ranking the evaluated tools on memory consumption. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Rocha H., Barreto R., Cordeiro L.",2015,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-319-22969-0_18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84944527690&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-22969-0_18&partnerID=40&md5=39ee300830bd65dc95a05bf841eea96d
Subgroup discovery as a method for generating test ontologies,"For the validation of ontologies, test cases can be applied. In order to ease the acquisition of such test cases, automatic methods can be used. This paper introduces such an approach to unit testing of ontologies using subgroup discovery methods. The tests are given by small ontologies, which will be compared to an existing ontology. The generation of the test ontologies uses subgroup discovery methods to derive concepts and relations from real data which refers to the ontology. For each concept of the ontology, we apply subgroup discovery in order to identify subgroup patterns consisting of concepts that are (un-) correlated with the target concept. Then, subgroups with very high (or low) confidence will be selected for the testing ontology. We exemplify the approach using real-world data from the ophthalmology domain, and present first results and experiences of a case study demonstrating the test case generation process.

Interference coordination scheme for OFDMA multi-hop relay cellular networks,"Multi-hop relay cellular networks (MRCNs) have drawn tremendous attention due to their high throughput and extensive coverage. However, introduction of relay stations (RSs) changes the frequency planning schemes for traditional cellular networks and how to efficiently allocate frequency resources to relay links becomes a challenging design issue. Moreover, the more compact the frequency reuse patterns, the more severe the co-channel interference (CCI), which affects the network performance significantly. In this paper, according to Specification IEEE 802.16j/m, based on the downlink radio resource management, a proper resource reuse scheme and multi-hop relay downlink sub-frame were designed to deal with the inter-cell interference and guarantee the efficient utilization of resources in networks. The efficient PF algorithm was applied in MRCNs to take into account both the overall system performance and fairness of users. Extensive simulations demonstrate that combination between interference coordination and resource scheduling can significantly improve system throughput and ameliorate fairness for users. ©, 2014, Science Press.

Inferring spatial and temporal behavioral patterns of free-ranging manatees using saltwater sensors of telemetry tags,"Diving or respiratory behavior in aquatic mammals can be used as an indicator of physiological activity and consequently, to infer behavioral patterns. Five Antillean manatees, Trichechus manatus manatus, were captured in Chetumal Bay and tagged with GPS tracking devices. The radios were equipped with a micropower saltwater sensor (SWS), which records the times when the tag assembly was submerged. The information was analyzed to establish individual fine-scale behaviors. For each fix, we established the following variables: distance (D), sampling interval (T), movement rate (D/. T), number of dives (N), and total diving duration (TDD). We used logic criteria and simple scatterplots to distinguish between behavioral categories: 'Travelling' (D/. T≥. 3. km/h), 'Surface' (↓TDD, ↓. N), 'Bottom feeding' (↑TDD, ↑. N) and 'Bottom resting' (↑TDD, ↓. N). Habitat categories were qualitatively assigned: Lagoon, Channels, Caye shore, City shore, Channel edge, and Open areas. The instrumented individuals displayed a daily rhythm of bottom activities, with surfacing activities more frequent during the night and early in the morning. More investigation into those cycles and other individual fine-scale behaviors related to their proximity to concentrations of human activity would be informative. © 2014 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.","Castelblanco-Martínez D.N., Morales-Vela B., Slone D.H., Padilla-Saldívar J.A., Reid J.P., Hernández-Arana H.A.",2015,Scopus,10.1016/j.mambio.2014.07.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920716013&doi=10.1016%2fj.mambio.2014.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=82f1824fbc2e8fffe2b5f42e4ae7af3e
Verifying implementation of security design patterns using a test template,"Although security patterns contain security expert knowledge to support software developers, these patterns may be inappropriately applied because most developers are not security specialists, leading to threats and vulnerabilities. Here we propose a validation method for security design patterns in the implementation phase of software development. Our method creates a test template from a security design pattern, which consists of the 'aspect test template' to observe the internal processing and the 'test case template'. Providing design information creates a test from the test template. Because a test template is recyclable, it can create easily a test, which can validate the security design patterns. As a case study, we applied our method to a web system. The result shows that our method can test repetition in the early stage of implementation, verify pattern applications, and assess whether vulnerabilities are resolved. © 2014 IEEE.","Yoshizawa M., Kobashi T., Washizaki H., Fukazawa Y., Okubo T., Kaiya H., Yoshioka N.",2014,Scopus,10.1109/ARES.2014.31,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920564182&doi=10.1109%2fARES.2014.31&partnerID=40&md5=4dd85dd06100bee48b751deab7932516
A large-scale evaluation of automated unit test generation using EvoSuite,"Research on software testing produces many innovative automated techniques, but because software testing is by necessity incomplete and approximate, any new technique faces the challenge of an empirical assessment. In the past, we have demonstrated scientific advance in automated unit test generation with the EvoSuite tool by evaluating it on manually selected open-source projects or examples that represent a particular problem addressed by the underlying technique. However, demonstrating scientific advance is not necessarily the same as demonstrating practical value; even if EvoSuite worked well on the software projects we selected for evaluation, it might not scale up to the complexity of real systems. Ideally, one would use large ""real-world"" software systems to minimize the threats to external validity when evaluating research tools. However, neither choosing such software systems nor applying research prototypes to them are trivial tasks. In this article we present the results of a large experiment in unit test generation using the EvoSuite tool on 100 randomly chosen open-source projects, the 10 most popular open-source projects according to the SourceForge Web site, seven industrial projects, and 11 automatically generated software projects. The study confirms that EvoSuite can achieve good levels of branch coverage (on average, 71% per class) in practice. However, the study also exemplifies how the choice of software systems for an empirical study can influence the results of the experiments, which can serve to inform researchers to make more conscious choices in the selection of software system subjects. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate how practical limitations interfere with scientific advances, branch coverage on an unbiased sample is affected by predominant environmental dependencies. The surprisingly large effect of such practical engineering problems in unit testing will hopefully lead to a larger appreciation of work in this area, thus supporting transfer of knowledge from software testing research to practice. © 2014 ACM.","Fraser G., Arcuri A.",2014,Scopus,10.1145/2685612,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920201232&doi=10.1145%2f2685612&partnerID=40&md5=c56133de2bee1209ec9235dc020fca4d
Optimized unit testing for antipattern detection,"Antipatterns are poor design choices that are conjectured to make object oriented systems harder to maintain. We investigate the impact of antipatterns on classes in object-oriented systems by studying the relation between the presence of antipatterns and the change- and fault-proneness of the classes. Due to increased complexities in the software development, there is huge need of testing process to be carried on in better way. Also as the computer systems are significant to our society in everyday life and are performing an increasing number of critical tasks, so more work in software testing and analysis has become of great importance. Anti pattern testing is type of testing which is used to cut off the directly price associated with testing of different modules.

A GUI based unit testing technique for antipattern identification,"Anti-patterns are considered as deficient programming practices that are unacceptable as a solution. They can be thought of as certain patterns in software development that are undesirable in comparison to design patterns which are acceptable solutions formalized for a common problem. From the study on anti-pattern classes involved in object-oriented systems, we examined the impact of presence of anti-patterns on the system. There are certain issues with the testing strategies used for finding bugs in the software systems such as objectives of testing, procedure used to test new functions, maximum resources and time needed to execute the project and the environment in which testing needs to be carried out. There is an enormous requirement to carry out testing process in a more suitable way due to the enlarged complications in the development of software systems. Anti-pattern testing is concerned with the reduction of testing cost for different modules.

Incorporating geostrophic wind information for improved space-time short-term wind speed forecasting1,"Accurate short-term wind speed forecasting is needed for the rapid development and efficient operation of wind energy resources. This is, however, a very challenging problem. Although on the large scale, the wind speed is related to atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other meteorological variables, no improvement in forecasting accuracy was found by incorporating air pressure and temperature directly into an advanced space-time statistical forecasting model, the trigonometric direction diurnal (TDD) model. This paper proposes to incorporate the geostrophic wind as a new predictor in the TDD model. The geostrophic wind captures the physical relationship between wind and pressure through the observed approximate balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis acceleration due to the Earth’s rotation. Based on our numerical experiments with data from West Texas, our new method produces more accurate forecasts than does the TDD model using air pressure and temperature for 1to 6-hour-ahead forecasts based on three different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, forecasting errors can be further reduced by using moving average hourly wind speeds to fit the diurnal pattern. For example, our new method obtains between 13.9% and 22.4% overall mean absolute error reduction relative to persistence in 2-hour-ahead forecasts, and between 5.3% and 8.2% reduction relative to the best previous space-time methods in this setting. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2014.","Zhu X., Bowman K.P., Genton M.G.",2014,Scopus,10.1214/14-AOAS756,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896392672&doi=10.1214%2f14-AOAS756&partnerID=40&md5=f6433a78accd104c9a55c7c0db6c3489
Reducing user input validation code in web applications using Pex extension,"Validation of user input data is very important in web application. Not only it protects the system from various exploits, but it also improves the user experience. User immediately sees what values are missing or are not valid and should be fixed. It is important to validate code on client side in the browser, but that does not mean that the validation on server side can be omitted. The golden rule of the web applications is not to trust user input and validate code on server side as well. The user input validation is therefore duplicated - it validates the input values first on client side using JavaScript before the data is sent to server and then the received data is validated again on the server side. Changes made to the validation code must be synchronized in code on both sides. All implementations must be also unit tested, multiple sets of unit tests must be created and maintained. We will describe how we extended white-box testing tool Pex to generate user input validation code for web applications created on .NET platform. The JavaScript client side validation code is generated from the controller code written in C#. The code then validates input values on the client side. Most of the testing can be automated executing generated test. Testing resources - i.e time spent on testing and number of testers involved people - are saved.

Test data generation from Hibernate constraints,"Hibernate framework is one the most widely used object-relational mapping framework in open source world.

Characterization of {11-22} GaN grown using two-step growth technique on shallowly etched r-plane patterned sapphire substrates,"Previously, we succeeded in growing flat semipolar {11-22} GaN layers on an r-plane patterned sapphire substrate (r-PSS). However, the GaN layers still contain a dislocation density of over 3×108/cm2 and stacking faults (SFs). To reduce such defects, we employed shallowly etched r-PSSs. The etching depths of the shallowly etched r-PSSs were from 100 to 500 nm, whereas that of a conventional r-PSS was 1 μm. As a result, we found that the threading dislocation density (TDD) decreases as the etching depth decreases. The TDD of the {11-22} GaN layer on r-PSS etched to a depth of 100 nm was 1.3×108/cm2. Moreover, the reduction of the SFs was observed by photoluminescence at cryogenic temperature. The reduction of the defects revealed the growth mechanism; the crystalline quality of {11-22} GaN on an r-PSS depends on the selective growth area of the sapphire sidewall. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Furuya H., Hashimoto Y., Yamane K., Okada N., Tadatomo K.",2014,Scopus,10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2013.12.032,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893169555&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcrysgro.2013.12.032&partnerID=40&md5=ff6f59f9e43319c12370a540ddd176e3

Test logic reuse through unit test patterns a test automation framework for software product lines,"Software product line (SPL) brings benefits such as lower time-to-market, less development costs, increased productivity and improved quality. The quality assurance can be reached through the testing area, however this area still has challenges and gaps in the SPL development. Since not all testing techniques used in a single product development can be applied to SPL, because of artifacts variabilities, further adaptations and new proposals are required. Our proposal thus is to adapt some unit tests patterns to SPL needs. The Test Automation Framework and Data-Driven Test patterns can provide the reuse of test logic and the automation of implementation mechanisms, reducing the effort required to test the variations of each application. Thus, we propose the Data-Driven Test Automation Framework to be used during the application engineering to configure the tests through Parameterized Tests and verify the correctness of the generated applications.

Aperture coupled wideband dielectric resonator antenna array with polarization reconfiguration,"Four elements aperture coupled cylindrical shaped Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) circular array is proposed for generating reconfigurable polarization radiation patterns. In this array, all the elements are sequentially fed to generate circular polarization. The linear and circular polarizations of the DRA array are achieved by exciting the elements in different arrangements. The antenna provides wideband impedance matching (S11 ≤ -10 dB) of 39% (2.7 to 4 GHz) which covers RADAR band (2.7-2.9 GHz) and LTE bands (FDD 22 (3.41-3.59 GHz), TDD 42(3.4-3.6 GHz), TDD 43 (3.6-3.8 GHz)) for both linear and circular polarization radiation patterns. © 2013 IEEE.","Kumari R., Behera S.K., Sharma S.K.",2014,Scopus,10.1109/AEMC.2013.7045056,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925433427&doi=10.1109%2fAEMC.2013.7045056&partnerID=40&md5=73fd6182ebed1a6d40c8f4eb2818ad4f
Downlink training codebook design and hybrid precoding in FDD massive MIMO systems,"Interest in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is growing because of their potential ability to improve spectral and energy efficiency. Most prior work on massive MIMO considers TDD operation that relies on channel reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels, whereas most current cellular systems adopt FDD without channel reciprocity. In an FDD mode, downlink channel estimation becomes a challenging issue due to the substantial training overhead that scales with the number of antennas, which can limit the potential gain of massive MIMO systems. To tackle the issue of channel estimation, we consider the design of a training codebook that has a suitable mapping for the training signal patterns in block transmissions under the assumption of a Kaiman filtering framework. We focus on a reduced dimensionality training codebook and transmit precoding design to enable low-complexity system configuration. We discuss how this framework can extend to hybrid analog-digital precoding using a limited number of active RF chains for transmit beamforming by applying the Toeplitz distribution theorem to large-scale linear antenna arrays. A practical guideline for training codebook parameters is presented, and numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2014 IEEE.","Noh S., Zoltowski M.D., Love D.J.",2014,Scopus,10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037042,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949922829&doi=10.1109%2fGLOCOM.2014.7037042&partnerID=40&md5=bbc9982c48ba9c4a041045ad687c11af
A framework for streamlining research workflow in neuroscience and psychology,"Successful accumulation of knowledge is critically dependent on the ability to verify and replicate every part of scientific conduct. However, such principles are difficult to enact when researchers continue to resort on ad-hoc workflows and with poorly maintained code base. In this paper I examine the needs of neuroscience and psychology community, and introduce psychopy_ext, a unifying framework that seamlessly integrates popular experiment building, analysis and manuscript preparation tools by choosing reasonable defaults and implementing relatively rigid patterns of workflow. This structure allows for automation of multiple tasks, such as generated user interfaces, unit testing, control analyses of stimuli, single-command access to descriptive statistics, and publication quality plotting. Taken together, psychopy_ext opens an exciting possibility for a faster, more robust code development and collaboration for researchers. © 2014 Kubilius.",Kubilius J.,2014,Scopus,10.3389/fninf.2013.00052,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903125678&doi=10.3389%2ffninf.2013.00052&partnerID=40&md5=15294179cf1fad211c8da4eeb4c6e8c8

A smart monitoring system for assisted living support using adaptive lifestyle pattern analysis a vision for the future,"In recent years there has been a rapidly increasing intensity of work going into investigating various methods of facilitating assisted living for the benefit of the elderly and those with difficulties in mobility. This chapter describes one such effort which distinguishes itself from the rest by considering and describing a system with true commercial potential and thus significant social impact. Promising efforts in investigating and identifying the requirements for a system of smart monitoring and adaptive lifestyle pattern detection and analysis are described. An initial proposal for a system relying on remote monitoring using persistent communications technology and a centralized data gathering, analysis and decision making is presented. During the initial development stage requirements for sensor placements, efficient sensor data formats and transmission protocols became apparent; unit testing and system validation demanded generation of large amounts of suitable sensor data. Here we also describe a simulator we developed in order to support these requirements; the rationale behind the simulator, its main functions and usage and the positive contribution it has made during the initial stages and the prototyping phases of the above system are explained. Finally a prototype developed in facilitating initial investigations is described and the vision for future developments is articulated. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Mustafa B., Matthew P., Naveed F.",2014,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-319-04702-7_1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958553024&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-04702-7_1&partnerID=40&md5=045f494f03d8eb6d6b77961178075eb7
An automated unit testing framework for wireless sensor networks,"Over 90 % of developers regard unit testing as most effective in reducing software bugs. However, current unit testing method which is writing test stub manually for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is designed for different applications. Combining Embedded Remote Procedure Call (ERPC) with web service, this paper presents a new Automated Unit Testing Framework (AUTF) of unit testing for WSN. First, tester uploads source code through web service interfaces. At the time of compiling, the server stub of ERPC, web service, and test case are generated automatically for the corresponding function unit. The AUTF automatically runs test case through dynamic and asynchronous web service invocation, and then converts web service invocations into remote function invocations from ERPC Client to ERPC Server.

Test-driven development as a reliable embedded software engineering practice,"Due to embedded co-design considerations, testing embedded software is typically deferred after the integration phase. Contrasting with the current embedded engineering practices, Test-Driven Development (TDD) promotes testing software during its development, even before the target hardware becomes available. Principally, TDD promotes a fast feedback cycle in which a test is written before the implementation. Moreover, each test is added to a test suite, which runs at every step in the TDD cycle. As a consequence, test-driven code is well tested and maintainable. Still, embedded software has some typical properties which impose challenges to apply the TDD cycle. Essentially, uploading software to target is generally too time-consuming to frequently run tests on target. Secondary issues are hardware dependencies and limited resources, such as memory footprint or processing power. In order to deal with these limitations, four methods have been identified and evaluated. Furthermore, a number of relevant design patterns are discussed to apply TDD in an embedded environment. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cordemans P., Van Landschoot S., Boydens J., Steegmans E.",2014,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-642-40888-5_4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84958523962&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-40888-5_4&partnerID=40&md5=b8c8f425a498e1f59b592f8f4dc085e9
Audiologic investigation in normally hearing adults with tinnitus complaint [Investigação audiológica em ouvintes normais com queixa de zumbido],"Introduction: Most studies about tinnitus focus on its association with factors such as hearing loss, otologic conditions, metabolic disorders, ototoxicity, aging or noise exposure. However, only a few studies focus on normally hearing subjects with tinnitus complaint. Objective: to investigate normally hearing adults with tinnitus complaint by (central) auditory processing tests and otoacoustic emissions. Method: Clinical transversal study. 24 adults with ages between 20 to 45 years of age, with basic audiologic evaluation within normal limits were evaluated. They were divided into two groups: experimental, consisting of eight patients with unilateral or bilateral, constant or frequent intermittent idiopathic tinnitus and control group composed of 16 normally hearing adults without tinnitus complaint. The (central) auditory processing tests used were: speech in noise, masking level difference (MLD), dichotic digits test (TDD) and pitch pattern sequence test (PPST). Transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were determined. Results: The mean score on the test speech in noise test was worse in patients with tinnitus complaint. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in other (central) auditory processing tests and in otoacoustic emissions. Conclusion: The performance of tinnitus patients was similar to those of individuals without complain in (central) auditory processing tests, with the exception of the test speech in noise, and in otoacoustic emissions. © Copyright Moreira Jr. Editora.

An investigation on the non-uniform distribution of radiation intensity output of diagnostic x-ray tubes,"Objective: This study aimed at investigating the air kerma distribution of the radiation output in two and three dimensions of three general radiographic units by physical measurements. Methods: A 6-cm3 ionization chamber was placed at 5-cm intervals of 225 locations in a 70 × 70 cm2 x-ray beam field. The chamber was placed at a level of 30 cm above the x-ray table to measure the air kerma intensity of the x-ray output across the whole area. Three different brands of radiographic units with different anode target angles and at different tube aging stages were studied. The same exposure parameters were used for each location, and measurements were made for three different tube potentials at 60, 85, and 110 kilovoltage peaks (kV[p]). Results: At the tube potential of 85 kV(p), the relative maximum percentage differences on the average air kerma measured along the central anode-cathode axis (x-axis) of the x-ray tube were found to be 31.5%, 15.5%, and 43.1% more at the cathode ends than those at the anode ends of the three radiographic units. Results of a paired samples t test (confidence intervals at 95%, two-tailed) on three of the four fixed pair-wise sampling points along the x-axis were found to be statistically significant in their relative percentage differences in air kerma intensity with respect to the central point (labeled as 35 cm) with a P value ≤.03. However, those measured at four fixed pair-wise points at 90° across the anode-cathode direction were all found to be statistically nonsignificant (P ≥ .29). Similar trends were observed for the other two tube potentials tested. From the three-dimensional displays of radiation output intensity, a similar unique pyramidal shape pattern with a skewed peak toward the cathode end was observed for all three diagnostic x-ray tubes tested. Conclusions: The anode heel effect was found to be enhanced in the x-ray tube with a smaller anode target angle, more aging, and higher tube potentials. Three-dimensional air kerma distribution maps of the three x-ray units tested were found to be similar in pattern, and this was displayed in detail regarding the extent of the anode heel effect. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Efficiency improvement of GaN-based ultraviolet light-emitting diodes with reactive plasma deposited AlN nucleation layer on patterned sapphire substrate,"The flip chip ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (FC UV-LEDs) with a wavelength of 365 nm are developed with the ex situ reactive plasma deposited (RPD) AlN nucleation layer on patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) by an atmospheric pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (AP MOCVD). The ex situ RPD AlN nucleation layer can significantly reduce dislocation density and thus improve the crystal quality of the GaN epitaxial layers. Utilizing high-resolution X-ray diffraction, the full width at half maximum of the rocking curve shows that the crystalline quality of the epitaxial layer with the (RPD) AlN nucleation layer is better than that with the low-temperature GaN (LT-GaN) nucleation layer. The threading dislocation density (TDD) is estimated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which shows the reduction from 6.8 × 107 cm−2 to 2.6 × 107 cm−2. Furthermore, the light output power (LOP) of the LEDs with the RPD AlN nucleation layer has been improved up to 30 % at a forward current of 350 mA compared to that of the LEDs grown on PSS with conventional LT-GaN nucleation layer. © 2014, Lee et al.; licensee Springer.","Lee C.-Y., Tzou A.-J., Lin B.-C., Lan Y.-P., Chiu C.-H., Chi G.-C., Chen C.-H., Kuo H.-C., Lin R.-M., Chang C.-Y.",2014,Scopus,10.1186/1556-276X-9-505,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919935397&doi=10.1186%2f1556-276X-9-505&partnerID=40&md5=8792587713d68c2a99b0122641f3ae0f
Kokkos: Enabling manycore performance portability through polymorphic memory access patterns,"The manycore revolution can be characterized by increasing thread counts, decreasing memory per thread, and diversity of continually evolving manycore architectures. High performance computing (HPC) applications and libraries must exploit increasingly finer levels of parallelism within their codes to sustain scalability on these devices. A major obstacle to performance portability is the diverse and conflicting set of constraints on memory access patterns across devices. Contemporary portable programming models address manycore parallelism (e.g., OpenMP, OpenACC, OpenCL) but fail to address memory access patterns. The Kokkos C++ library enables applications and domain libraries to achieve performance portability on diverse manycore architectures by unifying abstractions for both fine-grain data parallelism and memory access patterns. In this paper we describe Kokkos' abstractions, summarize its application programmer interface (API), present performance results for unit-test kernels and mini-applications, and outline an incremental strategy for migrating legacy C++ codes to Kokkos. The Kokkos library is under active research and development to incorporate capabilities from new generations of manycore architectures, and to address a growing list of applications and domain libraries. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Carter Edwards H., Trott C.R., Sunderland D.",2014,Scopus,10.1016/j.jpdc.2014.07.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84910092965&doi=10.1016%2fj.jpdc.2014.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=c6965f97236efbf9c14af08d5f4ddeaa
FDI - Employment Short-Run dynamics in South Africa: VECM approach,"This study uses the annual time –series data covering the period 1970 to 2013 to analyses the effect of employment on foreign direct investment (FDI) in South Africa using the vector error correction modelling (VECM). For this purpose, the behavioural patterns and quality of data are tested and these include the unit root test using the ZAU test and as well as the Correlograms for serial correlations. The ZA unit test results show that FDI, employment, real interest rates and real effective exchange rate are integrated of order zero while inflation was found to contain unit root. The Johansen cointegration test was performed to establish the number of cointegration vectors in the model and the test provides evidence of at most one cointegrating vector. With the long-run relationship present, the possibility of having short-run shocks was done with the aid of the VECM. VECM indicates that employment affects FDI positively in the short-run. Therefore, stable and economically sound environment and sound macroeconomic fundamentals are required in order to improve attract more FDI into South Africa. © MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.","Khumalo J., Mosıane O.",2014,Scopus,10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n20p522,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907290248&doi=10.5901%2fmjss.2014.v5n20p522&partnerID=40&md5=d94fe076b28f686c06c0f842752bdf45
Antenna grouping based feedback reduction for FDD-based massive MIMO systems,"Recent works on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have shown that a potential breakthrough in capacity gains can be achieved by deploying a very large number of antennas at the basestation. Although transmit-side channel state information (CSI) can be obtained by employing channel reciprocity in time division duplexing (TDD) systems, explicit feedback of CSI from the user to the basestation is required for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. In this paper, we propose an antenna grouping based feedback reduction technique for FDD-based massive MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm, dubbed antenna group beamforming (AGB), groups antenna elements using pre-designed patterns. The proposed method introduces the concept of using a header of overall feedback resources to select a suitable group pattern and the payload to quantize the effective channel vector. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves significant feedback overhead reduction over conventional approach. © 2014 IEEE.","Lee B., Choi J., Seol J.-Y., Love D.J., Shim B.",2014,Scopus,10.1109/ICC.2014.6884026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907000454&doi=10.1109%2fICC.2014.6884026&partnerID=40&md5=39b3d9a93affbe7f7a6b1234443de2b5
Software design for the VIS instrument onboard the Euclid mission: A multilayer approach,"The Euclid mission scientific payload is composed of two instruments: a VISible Imaging Instrument (VIS) and a Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer instrument (NISP). Each instrument has its own control unit. The Instrument Command and Data Processing Unit (VI-CDPU) is the control unit of the VIS instrument. The VI-CDPU is connected directly to the spacecraft by means of a MIL-STD-1553B bus and to the satellite Mass Memory Unit via a SpaceWire link. All the internal interfaces are implemented via SpaceWire links and include 12 high speed lines for the data provided by the 36 focal plane CCDs readout electronics (ROEs) and one link to the Power and Mechanisms Control Unit (VI-PMCU). VI-CDPU is in charge of distributing commands to the instrument sub-systems, collecting their housekeeping parameters and monitoring their health status. Moreover, the unit has the task of acquiring, reordering, compressing and transferring the science data to the satellite Mass Memory. This last feature is probably the most challenging one for the VI-CDPU, since stringent constraints about the minimum lossless compression ratio, the maximum time for the compression execution and the maximum power consumption have to be satisfied. Therefore, an accurate performance analysis at hardware layer is necessary, which could delay too much the design and development of software. In order to mitigate this risk, in the multilayered design of software we decided to design a middleware layer that provides a set of APIs with the aim of hiding the implementation of the HW connected layer to the application one. The middleware is built on top of the Operating System layer (which includes the Real-Time OS that will be adopted) and the onboard Computer Hardware. The middleware itself has a multi-layer architecture composed of 4 layers: the Abstract RTOS Adapter Layer (AOSAL), the Speci-c RTOS Adapter Layer (SOSAL), the Common Patterns Layer (CPL), the Service Layer composed of two subgroups which are the Common Service (CSL) and the Specific Service layer (SSL). The middleware design is made using the UML 2.0 standard. The AOSAL includes the abstraction of services provided by a generic RTOS (e.g Thread/Task, Time Management, Mutex and Semaphores) as well as an abstraction of SpaceWire and 1553-B bus Interface. The SOSAL is the implementation of AOSAL for the adopted RTOS. The CPL provides a set of patterns that are a general solution for common problems related to embedded hard Real Time systems. This set includes patterns for memory management, homogenous redundancy channels, pipes and filters for data exchange, proxies for slow memories, watchdog and reactive objects. The CPL is designed using a soft-metamodeling approach, so as to be as general as possible. Finally, the SL provides a set of services that are common to space applications. The testing of this middleware can be done both during the design using appropriate tools of analysis and in the implementation phase by means of unit testing tools. © 2014 SPIE.","Galli E., Di Giorgio A.M., Pezzuto S., Liu S.J., Giusi G., Li Causi G., Farina M., Cropper M., Denniston J., Niemi S.",2014,Scopus,10.1117/12.2056173,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906920527&doi=10.1117%2f12.2056173&partnerID=40&md5=98f068d75141d3417475973874da6175

A dynamic subframe set power control scheme for interference mitigation in reconfigurable TD-LTE systems,"In 3GPP LTE, TDD spectrum allocation for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) use is a function of a cell's TDD UL/DL configuration which designates which time resources (i.e., subframes) are for UL and which are for DL. TDD dynamic UL/DL reconfiguration, under discussion in LTE Release 12, enables cells to quickly adapt the ratio of allocated UL and DL subframes to changing traffic patterns which can be different for neighboring cells. Having different UL/DL directions for the same subframe in adjacent cells can result in new destructive interference components, i.e., eNB-to-eNB and UE-to-UE, with levels that can significantly differ from one subframe to another. In this paper, UL power control mechanisms are considered to manage such interference, where different sets of UL subframes use different UL power control parameters. In particular, two schemes are studied where, in one, fixed subframe sets are chosen based on expected interference and, in the other, the eNB monitors interference levels in the subframes and dynamically reconfigures the subframe sets accordingly. The performance of each scheme is evaluated through system level simulations and it is shown that the UL power control with dynamic UL subframe set configuration outperforms the one with static UL subframe sets, with significant improvement achieved at cell edge. © 2014 IEEE.","Kini A.V., Hosseinian M., Sadeghi P., Stern-Berkowitz J.",2014,Scopus,10.1109/WOCC.2014.6839949,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904157999&doi=10.1109%2fWOCC.2014.6839949&partnerID=40&md5=5a93fe56b446030a2f67e26521ee3b4c

Compositional specifications for ioco testing,"Model-based testing is a promising technology for black-box software and hardware testing, in which test cases are generated automatically from high-level specifications. Nowadays, systems typically consist of multiple interacting components and, due to their complexity, testing presents a considerable portion of the effort and cost in the design process. Exploiting the compositional structure of system specifications can considerably reduce the effort in model-based testing. Moreover, inferring properties about the system from testing its individual components allows the designer to reduce the amount of integration testing. In this paper, we study compositional properties of the ioco-testing theory. We propose a new approach to composition and hiding operations, inspired by contract-based design and interface theories. These operations preserve behaviors that are compatible under composition and hiding, and prune away incompatible ones. The resulting specification characterizes the input sequences for which the unit testing of components is sufficient to infer the correctness of component integration without the need for further tests. We provide a methodology that uses these results to minimize integration testing effort, but also to detect potential weaknesses in specifications. While we focus on asynchronous models and the ioco conformance relation, the resulting methodology can be applied to a broader class of systems. © 2014 IEEE.","Daca P., Henzinger T.A., Krenn W., Nickovic D.",2014,Scopus,10.1109/ICST.2014.50,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903127477&doi=10.1109%2fICST.2014.50&partnerID=40&md5=47118407940084ff0f10f0478e0a2b26
Optical properties of InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates with low threading dislocation densities,"We have grown blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with low threading dislocation densities (TDDs) by using SiN interlayers on Si (111) substrates. Our growth technique using SiN layers makes it possible to decrease twist components (edge-type threading dislocation components). The edge-type TDDs are almost the same values as those of LEDs grown on Al2O3 (0001) substrates. EQE of LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates increases with decreasing edge-type dislocation in the low-current-density region, and the EQE of the sample with low TDD is almost as high as that of the LED grown on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate at room temperature. It is found that the hot/cold factors (HCFs) of LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates increase with decreasing edge-type dislocations in the low-current-density region, but are less than those of an LED grown on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) shows that the dominant origin of the thermal quenching is edge-type dislocations in our samples, but other defects such as screw-type dislocations also contribute to it. We also found the fluctuated emission patterns consisting of bright and dark areas originated from the difference of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type defect densities in the multi-quantum wells (MQWs) grown on Si (111) substrates. The bright areas spread, and the configurations of the bright areas change into ring-like patterns with reducing edge-type TDDs. We suggest that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of dark areas should be promoted to improve the performance of the MQWs grown on Si (111) substrates. © 2014 SPIE.","Kimura S., Tajima J., Nago H., Hikosaka T., Yoshida H., Uesugi K., Nunoue S.",2014,Scopus,10.1117/12.2038714,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901817945&doi=10.1117%2f12.2038714&partnerID=40&md5=4bbbd96dabd053b3805a65c5b280f8dd
Enhancement of light output power on GaN-based light-emitting diodes using two-direction stripe-patterned sapphire substrate,"To achieve both the reduction of threading dislocation density (TDD) and the enhancement of light extraction efficiency (LEE) of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), a two-directional stripe-patterned sapphire substrate (TPSS) was fabricated. First, a stripe pattern parallel to the a-axis of Al2O3 was formed on an as-received c -sapphire wafer and then a second stripe pattern rotated around 3° from the m-axis of Al2O3 was formed on the first stripe PSS. The light output power of TPSS LEDs was around 1.25 times higher than that of LEDs on a flat sapphire substrate. This enhancement is caused by the increase of both the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and the LEE. On the other hand, although the LED on TPSS with the second stripe just parallel to the m-axis of Al2O3 showed a similar enhancement ratio of the light output power, the current leakage of this LED increased with the concentration of threading dislocations on the surface of LEDs. Stripes rotated 3° from the m-axis of Al2O3 changed the growth mode and realized GaN films with a smooth surface without pit formation. Therefore, the misalignment of the stripe from the m-axis of Al2O3 will become a new design parameter for realizing high-efficiency reliable LEDs. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Crystalline quality improvement of GaN coalesced using nano-PSS with void-embedded nanostructure by MOVPE,"The nanoscale patterned sapphire substrates (NPSS) were prepared combining nanoimprint lithography and dry/wet etching technology. The NPSS was patterned with 300 nm diameter, 330 nm depth, 550 nm periodicity hexagonal close packed pillars. Coalescence of GaN has been achieved on the NPSS using MOVPE. The growth mode and conditions were discussed in detail, which was different from that of GaN epitaxial on planar sapphire. The AFM images showed the GaN on NPSS had a smoother surface, and the XRD results showed that the crystal quality had been improved by the NPSS. The threading dislocation density (TDD) suppression was observed in transmission electron microscopy. Depth-resolved CL measurements were used to quantify the redshift in terms of bandgap renormalization and strain effects. It was supposed that the compressive stress in the GaN layers was changed gradually towards the growth surface. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Advantages of the moth-eye patterned sapphire substrate for the high performance nitride based LEDs,"We propose moth-eye patterned sapphire substrate (MPSS) as a solution to improve the light extraction efficiency and to reduce the production cost of LEDs. The MPSS samples' surfaces consisted of a triangular grid of about 375 nm high truncated cones with different pitches of 460 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, 700 nm and 800 nm. A commercially available patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) and a flat sapphire substrate (FSS) was also used in the experiments for comparison. According to the cathode luminescence observation, the GaN template on MPSS with a thickness of 3 μm showed a threading dislocation density (TDD) of around 1.9 × 108 cm-2. Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that many of the dislocations were bent and disappeared as loops formed in the vicinity of MPSS cones. On the other hand, PSS required a GaN template thicker than 5μm to achieve a level of TDD equal to MPSS. The LED on MPSS with a pitch of 600 nm showed the highest light output power among the evaluated LEDs as it was 1.89 times higher than that on FSS and 1.05 times higher than that on PSS. The pitch dependence of the light output improvement agrees with the pitch dependence of the simulated transmissivity at the GaN/sapphire interface. As a result of our comparison, we concluded that MPSS provides the most cost effective solution for high performance LEDs. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Uplink scheduling and adjacent-channel coupling loss analysis for TD-LTE deployment,"TD-LTE, one of the two duplexing modes in LTE, operates in unpaired spectrum and has the advantages of TDD-based technologies. It is expected that TD-LTE will be more rapidly deployed in near future and most of WiMax operators will upgrade their networks to TD-LTE gradually. Before completely upgrading to TD-LTE, WiMax may coexist with TD-LTE in an adjacent frequency band. In addition, multiple TD-LTE operators may deploy their networks in adjacent bands. When more than one TDD network operates in adjacent frequency bands, severe interference may happen due to adjacent channel interference (ACI) and unsynchronized operations. In this paper, coexistence issues between TD-LTE and other systems are analyzed and coexistence requirements are provided. This paper has three research objectives. First, frame synchronization between TD-LTE and WiMax is discussed by investigating possible combinations of TD-LTE and WiMax configurations. Second, an uplink scheduling algorithm is proposed to utilize a leakage pattern of ACI in synchronized operations. Third, minimum requirements for coexistence in unsynchronized operations are analyzed by introducing a concept of adjacent-channel coupling loss. From the analysis and simulation results, we can see that coexistence of TD-LTE with other TDD systems is feasible if the two networks are synchronized. For the unsynchronized case, some special cell-site engineering techniques may be required to reduce the ACI. © 2014 Woon-Young Yeo et al.","Yeo W.-Y., Moon S.H., Kim J.-H.",2014,Scopus,10.1155/2014/685102,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896378354&doi=10.1155%2f2014%2f685102&partnerID=40&md5=6e14ceef72623e132dc13b3f6271c340
On the design of discovery patterns for half-duplex TDD nodes operating in frame-based systems,"Future telecommunication systems need to support a discovery function, enabling all network nodes to discover each other directly over the air. In addition to discovery in traditional access point-to-user equipment (AP2UE) links, there is a need to support also other link types, such as device-to-device (D2D) communication and wireless backhauling. In this paper, we provide a design for discovery patterns and groups of patterns applicable to half-duplex time division duplexing (TDD) nodes operating in a frame based system. The proposed scheme allows an easy design of discovery patterns, which can be used for comprehensive bi-directional communication where all nodes are able to listen to each other. Proposed approach provides also an upper limit for the discovery time with an assumption that discovery signal is received correctly at the receiving node. We also support network topologies containing network elements of different hierarchies which require mono-directional discovery function among network nodes, e.g. from higher towards lower hierarchy levels. © 2013 Authors.","Tiirola E., Raaf B., Lähetkangas E., Harjula I., Pajukoski K.",2013,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890020102&partnerID=40&md5=4030d0253c0347acb844703adff61a98

In this context, problems associated with TDD were presented and analyzed. We illustrated how approaches inspired by microfabrication answered to the general enquiries about the efficacy of TDD: developing a method to improve the drugdelivery through an increased diffusion coefficient. This was achieved with the helpof ultrasound activating energy and of the hollow microneedles array. Diclofenac was the drug model.

Traffic adaptation and energy saving potential of centralized radio access networks with coordinated resource allocation and consolidation,"In this paper, we investigate traffic adaptation and energy saving potential of centralized radio access networks (C-RAN) with coordinated resource allocation and consolidation (CoRAC). The proposed CoRAC scheme comprises dynamic base-band unit-remote radio unit (BBU-RRU) mapping and cooperative dynamic downlink/uplink (DL/UL) reconfiguration. Specifically, in our proposed scheme, the logical connections between BBUs and RRUs are adaptively adjusted according the the traffic condition and interference patterns. Cell clusters are correspondingly formed, on which the developed cooperative reconfiguration method is conducted. With this setup, the DL/UL configurations are no longer determined with respect to an individual cell, but are chosen in form of the cluster-specific configuration patterns (CPs) with optimized performance metrics. Our proposed CoRAC scheme is custom designed for time-division duplex (TDD) systems aiming at (1) asymmetric traffic adaptation with load balancing; and (2) cross-subframe co-channel interference (CCI) management. In addition to (1) and (2), the CoRAC is beneficial from the perspective of network energy savings. This is because by shutting down under-utilized BBUs and selecting appropriate DL/UL configurations for traffic adaptation, the power consumption of both BBUs and RRUs (in terms of per-subframe radiated transmission power) can be reduced. System level evaluation results are provided, which show that by employing our proposed scheme, remarkable performance improvements can be obtained relative to the existing methods, in terms of the packet throughput, traffic adaptation and power consumption. © 2013 IEEE.","Zhu D., Lei M.",2013,Scopus,10.1109/ChinaCom.2013.6694662,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893595006&doi=10.1109%2fChinaCom.2013.6694662&partnerID=40&md5=fbe1e736507b9ecbb82e5c45070fbd07

PYTHIA: Generating test cases with oracles for JavaScript applications,Web developers often write test cases manually using testing frameworks such as Selenium. Testing JavaScript-based applications is challenging as manually exploring various execution paths of the application is difficult. Also JavaScript's highly dynamic nature as well as its complex interaction with the DOM make it difficult for the tester to achieve high coverage. We present a framework to automatically generate unit test cases for individual JavaScript functions. These test cases are strengthened by automatically generated test oracles capable of detecting faults in JavaScript code. Our approach is implemented in a tool called Pythia. Our preliminary evaluation results point to the efficacy of the approach in achieving high coverage and detecting faults. © 2013 IEEE.,"Mirshokraie S., Mesbah A., Pattabiraman K.",2013,Scopus,10.1109/ASE.2013.6693121,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893545759&doi=10.1109%2fASE.2013.6693121&partnerID=40&md5=1045fe7fa423d39cb54f70b0039c58aa
Automated unit testing of large industrial embedded software using concolic testing,"Current testing practice in industry is often ineffective and slow to detect bugs, since most projects utilize manually generated test cases. Concolic testing alleviates this problem by automatically generating test cases that achieve high coverage. However, specialized execution platforms and resource constraints of embedded software hinder application of concolic testing to embedded software. To overcome these limitations, we have developed CONcrete and symBOLic (CONBOL) testing framework to unit test large size industrial embedded software automatically. To address the aforementioned limitations, CONBOL tests target units on a host PC platform by generating symbolic unit testing drivers/stubs automatically and applying heuristics to reduce false alarms caused by the imprecise drivers/stubs. We have applied CONBOL to four million lines long industrial embedded software and detected 24 new crash bugs. Furthermore, the development team of the target software adopted CONBOL to their development process to apply CONBOL to the revised target software regularly. © 2013 IEEE.","Kim Y., Kim Y., Kim T., Lee G., Jang Y., Kim M.",2013,Scopus,10.1109/ASE.2013.6693109,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893544389&doi=10.1109%2fASE.2013.6693109&partnerID=40&md5=9618cb5241bda710dd9325ea310fd93a
A traffic aware joint CQI feedback and scheduling scheme for multichannel downlink systems in TDD feedback mode,"In this work we study the problem of channel state feedback and user scheduling in a single cell downlink wireless network employing multiple orthogonal parallel channels. The aspect of the system we are focusing on is stability. For user scheduling for stability as a performance measure, both the queue and channel states need to be known by the base station. However channel states can be known only via feedback from the receivers. In order to collect CQI feedback from each user at one channel, a fraction of the available time for transmission is used. This means that the time left to transmit is getting smaller. We present a joint feedback and scheduling algorithm which can guarantee an expansion of the stability region with respect to prior works. We also provide expressions regarding the distribution of the time needed to be devoted for feedback at each channel in some special cases. The proposed algorithm does not need knowledge of the statistics of the channels and traffic patterns.

Automatically generating tests from natural language descriptions of software behavior,"Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an emerging agile development approach where all stakeholders (including developers and customers) work together to write user stories in structured natural language to capture a software application's functionality in terms of required ""behaviors."" Developers can then manually write ""glue"" code so that these scenarios can be translated into executable software tests. This glue code represents individual steps within unit and acceptance test cases, and tools exist that automate the mapping from scenario descriptions to manually written code steps (typically using regular expressions). This paper takes the position that, instead of requiring programmers to write manual glue code, it is practical to convert natural language scenario descriptions into executable software tests fully automatically. To show feasibility, this paper presents preliminary results from a tool called Kirby that uses natural language processing techniques to automatically generate executable software tests from structured English scenario descriptions. Kirby relieves the developer from the laborious work of writing code for the individual steps described in scenarios, so that both developers and customers can both focus on the scenarios as pure behavior descriptions (understandable to all, not just programmers). Preliminary results from assessing the performance and accuracy of this technique are presented.

Automatic generation of parallel unit tests,"Multithreaded software is subject to data races. Currently available data race detectors report such errors to the developer, but consume large amounts of time and memory; many approaches are not applicable for large software projects. Unit tests containing fractions of the program lead to better results. We propose AutoRT, an approach to automatically generate parallel unit tests as target for data race detectors from existing programs. AutoRT uses the Single Static Multiple Dynamic (SSMD) analysis pattern to reduce complexity and can therefore be used efficiently even in large software projects. We evaluate AutoRT using Microsoft CHESS and show that with SSMD all 110 data races contained in our sample programs can be located. © 2013 IEEE.","Schimmel J., Molitorisz K., Jannesari A., Tichy W.F.",2013,Scopus,10.1109/IWAST.2013.6595789,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884997660&doi=10.1109%2fIWAST.2013.6595789&partnerID=40&md5=93576fd750a78036ec75c232cb647c51
An industry proof-of-concept demonstration of automated combinatorial test,"Studies have found that the largest single cost and schedule component of safety-critical, embedded system development is software rework: locating and fixing software defects found during test. In many such systems these defects are the result of interactions among no more than 6 variables, suggesting that 6-way combinatorial testing would be sufficient to trigger and detect them. The National Institute of Standards and Technology developed an approach to automatically generating, executing, and analyzing such tests. This paper describes an industry proof-of-concept demonstration of automated unit and integration testing using this approach. The goal was to see if it might cost-effectively reduce rework by reducing the number of software defects escaping into system test-if it was adequately accurate, scalable, mature, easy to learn, and easy to use and still was able to achieve the required level of structural coverage. Results were positive-e.g., 2775 test input vectors were generated in 6 seconds, expected outputs were generated in 60 minutes, and executing and analyzing them took 8 minutes. Tests detected all seeded defects and in the proof-of-concept demonstration achieved nearly 100% structural coverage. © 2013 IEEE.",Bartholomew R.,2013,Scopus,10.1109/IWAST.2013.6595802,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884992542&doi=10.1109%2fIWAST.2013.6595802&partnerID=40&md5=ad4e8c8bc76befe5e50ef1aafd049278
Towards test case reuse: A study of redundancies in android platform test libraries,"Similar software systems have similar test cases. We find much redundancy even within test cases of a single system. In this paper, we describe the results of similarity analysis performed on Android platform framework project's test case libraries. The results confirm our hypothesis that reuse of test cases can boost productivity at least as much as reuse of code. We identified repetition patterns in Android platform framework test case libraries that can be represented in generic form for further reuse using variability techniques adopted from Software Product Line (SPL). By exploiting similarity among test cases, we can design generic test case libraries that are much smaller, easier to develop/evolve than existing test case libraries. In this paper, we present quantitative and qualitative findings from our study of Android platform framework test case libraries.

UI-design driven model-based testing,"Testing interactive systems is a notoriously difficult task. Not only do we need to ensure that the functionality of the developed system is correct with respect to the requirements and specifications, but also we need to ensure that the user interface (UI) to the system is correct (enables a user to access the functionality correctly) and is usable. These different requirements of interactive system testing are not easily combined within a single testing strategy. We investigate the use of models of interactive systems, which have been derived from design artefacts, as the basis for generating tests for an implemented system. We show how automatically generated abstract tests can be used as the basis for a model-based method for testing interactive systems which has low overhead in terms of the models required and which enables testing of UI and system functionality from the perspective of user interaction. We also examine other testing strategies which use the same abstract tests as their basis and discuss general problems in the area of interactive system testing and propose some solutions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.","Bowen J., Reeves S.",2013,Scopus,10.1007/s11334-013-0199-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84881490451&doi=10.1007%2fs11334-013-0199-6&partnerID=40&md5=84aee5d0e94afca995124d660dc130b8

A business protocol unit testing framework for Web service composition,"Unit testing is a critical step in the development lifecycle of business processes for ensuring product reliability and dependability. Although plenty of unit testing approaches for WS-BPEL have been proposed, only a few of them designed and implemented a runnable unit testing framework, and none of them provides a technique to systematically specifying and testing the causal and temporal dependencies between the process-under-test and its partner services. In this paper, we propose a novel approach and framework for specifying and testing the inter-dependencies between the process-under-test and its partner services. The dependency constraints defined in the business protocol are declaratively specified using a pattern-based high-level language, and a FSA-based approach is proposed for detecting the violation of constraints. A testing framework that integrates with the Java Finite State Machine framework has been implemented to support the specification of both dependency constraints and test cases, and the execution and result analysis of test cases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Yu J., Han J., Gunarso S.O., Versteeg S.",2013,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-642-38709-8_2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84879851429&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-38709-8_2&partnerID=40&md5=fc4f925697426e563997c997e6ad3dff
Development of 260 nm band deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes on Si substrates,"Deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have a wide range of potential applications, such as sterilization, water purification, and medicine. In recent years, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the performance of AlGaNbased DUV LEDs on sapphire substrates have increased markedly due to improvements in the crystalline-quality of high Al-content AlGaN layers, and the optimization of LED structures. On the other hand, DUV LEDs fabricated on Si substrates are very promising as a low-cost DUV light-source in the near future. However, AlN layers on Si have suffered from cracking induced by the large mismatch in lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients between AlN and Si. In this paper, DUV LEDs on Si were realized by a combination of a reduction in the number of cracks and of the threading dislocation density (TDD) of AlN templates by using the epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) method. The ELO-AlN templates were successfully coalesced on trench-patterned substrates, with the stripes running along the <1-100> direction of AlN. The density of cracks was greatly reduced in 4- m-thick ELO-AlN templates, because voids formed by the ELO process relaxed the tensile stress in the AlN layer. Furthermore, the AlN templates showed low-TDD. The full-width-at-half-maximum values of the (0002) and (10-12) X-ray rocking curves were 780 and 980 arcsec, respectively. DUV LEDs fabricated on these high-quality ELO-AlN/Si substrates showed single peak emission at 256- 278 nm in electroluminescence measurements. It is expected that we will be able to realize low-cost DUV LEDs on Si substrates by using ELO-AlN templates. © 2013 SPIE.","Mino T., Hirayama H., Takanoa T., Tsubakia K., Sugiyama M.",2013,Scopus,10.1117/12.2002322,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878700831&doi=10.1117%2f12.2002322&partnerID=40&md5=6652e44d51b591d3e6c4319ab6e7be77
Influence of confirmation biases of developers on software quality: An empirical study,"The thought processes of people have a significant impact on software quality, as software is designed, developed and tested by people. Cognitive biases, which are defined as patterned deviations of human thought from the laws of logic and mathematics, are a likely cause of software defects. However, there is little empirical evidence to date to substantiate this assertion. In this research, we focus on a specific cognitive bias, confirmation bias, which is defined as the tendency of people to seek evidence that verifies a hypothesis rather than seeking evidence to falsify a hypothesis. Due to this confirmation bias, developers tend to perform unit tests to make their program work rather than to break their code. Therefore, confirmation bias is believed to be one of the factors that lead to an increased software defect density. In this research, we present a metric scheme that explores the impact of developers' confirmation bias on software defect density. In order to estimate the effectiveness of our metric scheme in the quantification of confirmation bias within the context of software development, we performed an empirical study that addressed the prediction of the defective parts of software. In our empirical study, we used confirmation bias metrics on five datasets obtained from two companies. Our results provide empirical evidence that human thought processes and cognitive aspects deserve further investigation to improve decision making in software development for effective process management and resource allocation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Çalıklı G., Bener A.B.",2013,Scopus,10.1007/s11219-012-9180-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875477125&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-012-9180-0&partnerID=40&md5=cc6f8f69000fcbb792e93b5cc875f69d
Coexistence analysis of adjacent long term evolution (LTE) systems,"As the licensing and deployment of Long term evolution (LTE) systems are ramping up, the study of coexistence of LTE systems is an essential topic in civil and military applications. In this paper, we present a coexistence study of adjacent LTE systems aiming at evaluating the effect of inter-system interference on system capacity and performance as a function of some of the most common mitigation techniques: frequency guard band, base station (BS) antenna coupling loss, and user equipment (UE) antenna spacing. A system model is constructed for two collocated macro LTE networks. The developed model takes into consideration the RF propagation environment, power control scheme, and adjacent channel interference. Coexistence study is performed for a different combination of time/frequency division duplex (TDD/FDD) systems under three different guard-bands of OMHz, 5MHZ, and 10MHz.

A study on the relation between antipatterns and the cost of class unit testing,"Antipatterns are known as recurring, poor design choices, recent and past studies indicated that they negatively affect software systems in terms of understand ability and maintainability, also increasing change-and defect-proneness. For this reason, refactoring actions are often suggested. In this paper, we investigate a different side-effect of antipatterns, which is their effect on testability and on testing cost in particular. We consider as (upper bound) indicator of testing cost the number of test cases that satisfy the minimal data member usage matrix (MaDUM) criterion proposed by Bashir and Goel. A study - carried out on four Java programs, Ant 1.8.3, ArgoUML 0.20, Check Style 4.0, and JFreeChart 1.0.13 - supports the evidence that, on the one hand, antipatterns unit testing requires, on average, a number of test cases substantially higher than unit testing for non-antipattern classes. On the other hand, antipattern classes must be carefully tested because they are more defect-prone than other classes. Finally, we illustrate how specific refactoring actions - applied to classes participating in antipatterns - could reduce testing cost. © 2013 IEEE.","Sabané A., Di Penta M., Antoniol G., Guéhéneuc Y.-G.",2013,Scopus,10.1109/CSMR.2013.26,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877308389&doi=10.1109%2fCSMR.2013.26&partnerID=40&md5=3492708d9fadf70245077dcc572aa42b

Requirements management in Scrum based on test driven development [Gerenciamento de Requisitos em Scrum baseado em Test Driven Development],"In order to improve the success rate of software projects various development methodologies have been proposed as alternative to traditional models of development, the agile methodologies.

Meanwhile, the agile methodologies focus on the interaction between those involved in the project to deal with the same goals.

Coordinated resource allocation in centralized radio access networks with dynamic downlink/uplink reconfiguration,"We propose and evaluate a novel coordinated resource allocation scheme in Time Division Duplex (TDD) systems where the downlink/uplink (DL/UL) resources are allocated dynamically for asymmetric traffic adaptation. To eliminate the cross-subframe co-channel interference (CCI), we first formulate the dynamic reconfiguration problem as the cooperative control that operates on disjoint cell clusters. With this setup, the DL/UL configurations are no longer determined with respect to an individual cell, but are chosen in form of the cluster-specific configuration patterns (CPs) with optimized performance metrics. Additionally, a novel CCI cancelation (CCIC) method, termed cross-subframe coordinated scheduling/beamforming (CCS/CCB) is incorporated in the proposed reconfiguration approach. By jointly designing and optimizing the beamforming vectors and the traffic scheduling, the residual intra-cluster CCI can be mitigated. © 2013 IEEE.","Zhu D., Lei M., Goldsmith A.",2013,Scopus,10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831636,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904098035&doi=10.1109%2fGLOCOM.2013.6831636&partnerID=40&md5=4700dd3c6accfbd81a9035c2f56211e9
Performance of downlink control channels for mobile hotspot network system,"Currently, the high speed data rate services for mobile group vehicles moving at high speed are acutely required.

Cathodoluminescence and TEM investigations of structural and optical properties of AlGaN on epitaxial laterally overgrown AlN/sapphire templates,"Surface steps as high as 15 nm on up to 10 μm thick AlN layers grown on patterned AlN/sapphire templates play a major role for the structural and optical properties of AlxGa1-xN layers with x ≥ 0.5 grown subsequently by metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. The higher the Ga content in these layers is, the stronger is the influence of the surface morphology on their properties. For x = 0.5 not only periodic inhomogeneities in the Al content due to growth of Ga-rich facets are observed by cathodoluminescence, but these facets give rise to additional dislocation formation as discovered by annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. For AlxGa1-xN layers with x = 0.8 the difference in Al content between facets and surrounding material is much smaller. Therefore, the threading dislocation density (TDD) is only defined by the TDD in the underlying epitaxially laterally overgrown (ELO) AlN layer. This way high quality Al0.8Ga0.2N with a thickness up to 1.5 μm and a TDD ≤ 5×108 cm-2 was obtained.","Zeimer U., Mogilatenko A., Kueller V., Knauer A., Weyers M.",2013,Scopus,10.1088/1742-6596/471/1/012021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890742078&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f471%2f1%2f012021&partnerID=40&md5=8e5be29744033f84cd65c212601f3dd8
Designing multi-agent unit tests using systematic test design patterns-(extended version),"Software agents are the basic building blocks in many software systems especially those based on artificial intelligence methods, e.g., reinforcement learning based multi-agent systems (MASs). However, testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy, distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows MAS developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the JUnit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Model-driven testing for web applications using abstract state machines,"The increasing diffusion and importance of Web Applications has led to strict requirements in terms of continuity of the service, because their unavailability can lead to severe economic losses. Techniques to assure the quality of these applications are thus needed in order to identify in advance possible faults. Model-driven approaches to the testing of Web Applications can provide developers with a way of checking the conformance of the actual Web Application with respect to the model built from the requirements. These approaches can be used to automatically generate from the model a set of test cases satisfying certain coverage criteria, and thus can be integrated in a classical test driven development process.

Iterative and pattern-based development of internal domain-specific languages,"Internal DSLs are a special kind of DSLs that use an existing programming language as their host. In this chapter, the author explains an iterative development process for internal DSLs. The goals of this process are: (1) to give developers a familiar environment in which they can use known and proven development steps, techniques, tools, and host languages, (2) to provide a set of repeatable, iterative steps that support the continuous adaptation and evolution of the domain knowledge and the DSL implementation, and (3) to apply design principles that help to develop DSLs with essential properties and to use host language independent design patterns to plan and communicate the design and implementation of the DSL. The process consists of three development steps (analysis, language design, and language implementation) and applies four principles: open form, agile and test-driven development, design pattern knowledge, and design principle knowledge. © 2013, IGI Global.",Günther S.,2012,Scopus,10.4018/978-1-4666-2092-6.ch006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899402340&doi=10.4018%2f978-1-4666-2092-6.ch006&partnerID=40&md5=028c4b543c33811a9b07db2acb231dc5
Dependable solutions design by Agile Modeled Layered Security Architectures,"Our research entitled ""Designing Dependable Agile Layered Security Architecture Solutions"" addresses the innovative idea and novel implementations of Security Engineering for Software Engineering using Agile Modeled Layered Security Architectures for Dependable Privacy Requirements, with a validation of an exemplar case study of Web Services Security Architectures. Securing the Software Architecture in any application at design phase is known as Security Architectures, and we focus on authentication and authorization of the user. Now a day most of the applications are developed as a Layered Security Architecture Pattern, typically we have user presentation layer, Business Logic Layer and Database access layer. Now Agile modeling is used in all applications design (but Agile Modeled Architectures are given little importance) because of shortened developed time, with customer collaborations with developers and importantly with Test Driven Development approaches. Securing Agile Modeled architectures, which being an iterative development, will provide enhanced Dependable Security Requirements in terms of Privacy of user, in its successive iterations.

Test scenarios generation based on use cases,"This research group has been working towards building an environment which helps software development, providing support to some activities based on use case model. Prior to our enrollment in this research, the environment supported use case construction, requirements document analysis, requirements traceability and use case points estimation. In this paper it is presented a strategy to generate test scenarios for unit testing and integration testing, based on use case model. Such test scenarios are generated automatically through a module that uses information from this broader environment and they are a starting point to test case definition. The data modeling was based on some proposals found in literature which provided the means to implement the dependency chart, graphs and the test tree. Such structures supported the test scenarios generation. Based on a system previously tested from a real company, we compared the unit and integration test scenarios generated by the environment and the results showed that some test cases were not covered by our new module but, on the other side, some generated scenarios were not planned by the company. With this in mind, the test scenarios automatically generated by the environment can be considered as a support to the test plan elaboration and to the test case definition.","Octaviano F.R., Di Thomazzo A., Camargo K., Fabbri S.",2012,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886652154&partnerID=40&md5=a8f9da9b6ea7c8f61588d31ad069d346
Analysis of spectral efficiency for licensed bands WIMAX,"This paper introduces a spectral analysis techniques made from TDD and FDD which are present on the IEEE 802.16 and used by WiMAX in the uplink-downlink bidirectional channels. The simulation model considered in the arrival queue services, the FIFO concept and the simulations were performed considering five applications (Streaming, Download, Web, Email and Small-Transaction) for downlink and uplink. The number of channels on the Base Station varied from 4 to 60, with a throughput of 600 kbps, where the considered efficiency parameter was the minimum number of channels required for each channel pattern. The simulations were performed in three different scenarios for different traffic profiles for downlink and uplink, and the analyzes of the performance, taken as a measure of the efficiency arrival rate and waiting time before the user's typical applications used in-band technology licensed WiMAX, which follows this pattern. The made analysis allowed identifying, given these traffic conditions, which technique is better recommended.

Low threading dislocation density in GaN films grown on patterned sapphire substrates,"The growth process of three-dimensional growth mode (3D) switching to two-dimensional growth mode (2D) is investigated when GaN films are grown on cone-shaped patterned sapphire substrates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The growth condition of the 3D-2D growth process is optimized to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD). It is found that the condition of the 3D layer is critical. The 3D layer keeps growing under the conditions of low V/III ratio, low temperature, and high pressure until its thickness is comparable to the height of the cone-shaped patterns. Then the 3D layer surrounds the cone-shaped patterns and has inclined side facets and a top (0001) plane. In the following 2D-growth process, inclined side facets coalesce quickly and the interaction of TDs with the side facets causes the TDs to bend over. As a result, the TDD of GaN films can decrease to 1 × 108 cm-2, giving full-width at half maximum values of 211 and 219 arcsec for (002) and (102) omega scans, respectively. © 2012 Chinese Institute of Electronics.","Liang M., Wang G., Li H., Li Z., Yao R., Wang B., Li P., Li J., Yi X., Wang J., Li J.",2012,Scopus,10.1088/1674-4926/33/11/113002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870444742&doi=10.1088%2f1674-4926%2f33%2f11%2f113002&partnerID=40&md5=a72d5e794ae95e5567de0a01f84729ff
Which factors predict glycemic control in children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes before 6.5 years of age?,"Predictors of long-term glycemic control and growth patterns in children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) before 6.5 years of age were evaluated. One hundred seventy-three children (84 boys) with a mean diabetes duration of 4.9 ± 2.8 years participated in this observational study. Medical charts were reviewed for background, disease- and treatment-related parameters, and growth parameters. Study endpoints were HbA1c value, rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis events, and growth patterns. Mean HbA1c for the total duration of diabetes (HbA1c-TDD) was 7.9 ± 0.8%. Comparison of the study variables between patients with HbA1c-TDD <7.5% (n = 53) or ≥7.5% yielded a significantly shorter duration of diabetes (P = 0.01) and lower rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (P = 0.02) in those with HbA1C-TDD <7.5%, without differences between these groups in age at diabetes onset, insulin regimens, daily glucose measurements, and rate of severe hypoglycemia. Factors significantly predicting achievement of the mean target HbA1c-TDD <7.5% were lower HbA1c at 0.5 years and 1 year after diabetes diagnosis (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). Patients followed for at least 5 years (n = 48) showed a significant decrease in height-SDS (P < 0.001) and a significant increase in weight-SDS (P = 0.004) from diabetes diagnosis to the last follow-up visit, without a significant change in weight-SDS from 0.5 years after diagnosis to the last follow-up visit. Our results suggest that in patients with T1D diagnosed during the preschool-age, mean HbA1c level in the first year is a strong predictor of achieving target HbA1c level in the subsequent years, regardless the type of insulin regimen.

Student perceptions of the progress test in two settings and the implications for test deployment,"Background The Progress Test (PT) was developed to assess student learning within integrated curricula. Whilst it is effective in promoting and rewarding deep approaches to learning in some settings, we hypothesised that implementation of the curriculum (design and assessment) may impact on students' preparation for the PT and their learning. Aim To compare students' perceptions of and preparations for the PT at two medical schools. Method Focus groups were used to generate items for a questionnaire. This was piloted, refined, and then delivered at both schools. Exploratory factor analysis identified the main factors underpinning response patterns. ANOVA was used to compare differences in response by school, year group and gender. Results Response rates were 640 (57%) and 414 (47%) at Schools A and B, respectively. Three major factors were identified: the PT's ability to (1) assess academic learning (2) support clinical learning; (3) the PT's impact on exam preparation. Significant differences were found between settings. In the school with early clinical contact, more frequent PTs and no end of unit tests, students were more likely to appreciate the PT as a support for learning, perceive it as fair and valid, and use a deeper approach to learning-but they also spent longer preparing for the test. Conclusion Different approaches to the delivery of the PT can impact significantly on student study patterns. The learning environment has an important impact on student perceptions of assessment and approach to learning. Careful decisions about PT deployment must be taken to ensure its optimal impact. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Wade L., Harrison C., Hollands J., Mattick K., Ricketts C., Wass V.",2012,Scopus,10.1007/s10459-011-9334-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866075975&doi=10.1007%2fs10459-011-9334-z&partnerID=40&md5=dcce7450cd8e0800aa631b7dfbb58d6b
Exploring influences on student adherence to test-driven development,"Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process with a test-first approach that shows promise for improving code quality.

In a CS2 class, we used an automated testing tool and post-class surveys to observe patterns of behavior in testing as well as changes in attitudes. We found significant positive outcomes for students following TDD.

Deletion of TerD-domain-encoding genes: Effect on Streptomyces coelicolor development,"TerD-domain-encoding genes (tdd genes) are highly represented in the Streptomyces coelicolor genome. One of these, the tdd8 gene, was recently shown to have a crucial influence on growth, differentiation, and spore development of this filamentous bacterium. The investigation of the potential role of tdd genes has been extended here to tdd7 (SCO2367) and tdd13 (SCO4277). Both genes are highly expressed in bacteria grown in liquid-rich medium (tryptic soy broth). However, the deletion of these genes in S. coelicolor showed contrasting effects regarding developmental patterns, sporulation, and antibiotic production. Deletion of the tdd7 gene induced a reduction of growth in liquid medium, wrinkling of the mycelium on solid medium, and poor spore and actinorhodin production. On the other hand, deletion of the tdd13 gene did not significantly affect growth in liquid medium but induced a small colony phenotype on solid medium with abundant sporulation and overproduction of undecylprodigiosin. Although their exact functions remain undefined, the present data suggest a major involvement of TerD proteins in the proper development of S. coelicolor.","Sanssouci É., Lerat S., Daigle F., Grondin G., Shareck F., Beaulieu C.",2012,Scopus,10.1139/w2012-101,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867868470&doi=10.1139%2fw2012-101&partnerID=40&md5=0c9ffbd010696a3fe3d24ccf7c9bc635
Ballerina: Automatic generation and clustering of efficient random unit tests for multithreaded code,"Testing multithreaded code is hard and expensive. A multithreaded unit test creates two or more threads, each executing one or more methods on shared objects of the class under test. Such unit tests can be generated at random, but basic random generation produces tests that are either slow or do not trigger concurrency bugs. Worse, such tests have many false alarms, which require human effort to filter out. We present Ballerina, a novel technique for automated random generation of efficient multithreaded tests that effectively trigger concurrency bugs. Ballerina makes tests efficient by having only two threads, each executing a single, randomly selected method. Ballerina increases chances that such simple parallel code finds bugs by appending it to more complex, randomly generated sequential code. We also propose a clustering technique to reduce the manual effort in inspecting failures of automatically generated multithreaded tests. We evaluate Ballerina on 14 real-world bugs from six popular codebases: Groovy, JDK, JFreeChart, Apache Log4j, Apache Lucene, and Apache Pool. The experiments show that tests generated by Ballerina find bugs on average 2X-10X faster than basic random generation, and our clustering technique reduces the number of inspected failures on average 4X-8X. Using Ballerina, we found three previously unknown bugs, two of which were already confirmed and fixed. © 2012 IEEE.","Nistor A., Luo Q., Pradel M., Gross T.R., Marinov D.",2012,Scopus,10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227145,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864224668&doi=10.1109%2fICSE.2012.6227145&partnerID=40&md5=2e5c28ae0d3b7c49081452305c8e89b2
The entity system architecture and its application in an undergraduate game development studio,"This paper reports on the software architecture, methodology, and student learning experience from the development of Morgan's Raid, an educational game designed to teach fourth-graders about Indiana's Civil War history. The game was designed and developed during the 2010-2011 academic year and involved a multidisciplinary undergraduate team. The team used industrial best-practices of game development, including continuous integration, distributed version control, test-driven development, and Scrum. This methodology was supported by an entity system architecture, a software architectural design pattern that addresses many shortcomings of inheritance-based game engine architectures. Detailed definitions of the entity system architecture and methodology are presented along with the experience report. This combination of methodology and architecture directly contributed to the success of the project, both as a software development exercise and as a learning experience.

Improving unfamiliar code with unit tests: An empirical investigation on tool-supported and human-based testing,"Software testing is a well-established approach in modern software engineering practice to improve software products by systematically introducing unit tests on different levels during software development projects. Nevertheless existing software solutions often suffer from a lack of unit tests which have not been implemented during development because of time restrictions and/or resource limitations. A lack of unit tests can hinder effective and efficient maintenance processes. Introducing unit tests after deployment is a promising approach for (a) enabling systematic and automation-supported tests after deployment and (b) increasing product quality significantly. An important question is whether unit tests should be introduced manually by humans or automatically generated by tools. This paper focuses on an empirical investigation of tool-supported and human-based unit testing in a controlled experiment with focus on defect detection effectiveness, false positives, and test coverage of two different testing approaches applied to unfamiliar source code. Main results were that (a) individual testing approaches (human-based and tool-supported testing) showed advantages for different defect classes, (b) tools delivered a higher number of false positives, and (c) higher test coverage. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Winkler D., Schmidt M., Ramler R., Biffl S.",2012,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-642-31063-8_22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862172530&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-31063-8_22&partnerID=40&md5=fbdeaadea0696d780f9ec89d2b19f01a
"Pharmacoepidemiology of testosterone prescribing in Australia, 1992-2010","Objective: To describe patterns of testosterone prescribing in Australia over the past two decades by state or territory and by product type. Design and setting: Observational analysis of testosterone prescribing data obtained from two independent data sources-the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and IMS, a source of commercial pharmaceutical sales data. Main outcome measures: Temporal trends in testosterone prescribing-measured as units prescribed (converted into monthly defined doses) and expenditure-according to state or territory and product type (injectable, implantable, transdermal and oral). Results: Over two decades, total annual expenditure on testosterone products increased ninefold to $12.7 million according to PBS data and fivefold to $16.3 million according to IMS data. When adjusted for inflation and population growth, expenditure increased 4.5-fold according to PBS data and 2.5-fold according to IMS data. The patterns of testosterone prescribing according to PBS and IMS data were highly congruent. When converted into monthly defined dose units, testosterone prescribing increased over the two decades with approximately twofold differences in total testosterone prescribed per capita between the states and territories with the highest and lowest rates of prescribing. When analysed by product type, the stable market patterns over the first 15 years were disrupted by sharp changes to create market dominance owing to introduction of two new testosterone products-a depot injectable testosterone and a transdermal testosterone gel. Conclusions: The progressive increase in PBS-subsidised testosterone prescribing without changes in proven medical indications or improvements in diagnosis of pathologically based androgen deficiency are likely to be due to promotion-driven non-compliance with PBS prescribing criteria, indicating that more effective implementation of the criteria is needed.",Handelsman D.J.,2012,Scopus,10.5694/mja11.11277,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865077426&doi=10.5694%2fmja11.11277&partnerID=40&md5=7155907a48a0b49492e9cd3e315cccbd

The above tri-sector cell architecture possesses additional orthogonality inherently due to the directivity of directional antenna, which can provide an additional degree of freedom in allocating radio resource with the channel locked directly in the section of the neighbor cell.

Sounding reference signal pattern design for time division duplex multiple-input multiple-output and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems,"In the long-term evolution (LTE) time division duplex (TDD) systems, base stations (BSs) use uplink sounding reference signals (SRSs) to estimate downlink channel state information (CSI) for downlink beamforming transmissions. In the current SRS pattern scheme, because SRSs of up to eight users are multiplexed on the same time-frequency resources, there exist mutual interferences among these SRSs over fading channels. Thus, the current scheme impacts the estimation accuracy of CSI and degrades the beamforming performance. Based on the characteristics of TDD systems, the authors propose a SRS pattern scheme, in which each user sends SRSs only on the allocated bandwidth instead of on full bandwidth as in the current LTE TDD systems, to eliminate the interferences among SRSs. Simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the current scheme in the estimation accuracy for various frequency-selective and time-selective fading channels. In addition, compared with the current SRS pattern scheme, the proposed SRS pattern scheme is robust to frequency-selective channels, and does not be impacted by the timing offset, and provides the flexibility for the choice of channel estimator at the BS side. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.","Zhou B., Jiang L., He C., Zhao S.",2012,Scopus,10.1049/iet-com.2011.0435,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862255504&doi=10.1049%2fiet-com.2011.0435&partnerID=40&md5=3b41bd2427d390515948501b6a4e6858
SEUSS: Decoupling responsibilities from static methods for fine-grained configurability,"Unit testing is often made more difficult by the heavy use of classes as namespaces and the proliferation of static methods to encapsulate configuration code. We have analyzed the use of 120 static methods from 96 projects by categorizing them according to their responsibilities. We find that most static methods support a hodgepodge of mixed responsibilities, held together only by their common need to be globally visible. Tight coupling between instances and their classes breaks encapsulation, and, together with the global visibility of static methods, complicates testing. By making dependency injection a feature of the programming language, we can get rid of static methods altogether. We employ the following semantic changes: (1) Replace every occurrence of a global with an access to an instance variable; (2) Let that instance variable be automatically injected into the object when it is instantiated. We present Seuss, a prototype that implements this change of semantics in Smalltalk. We show how Seuss eliminates the need to use class methods for non-reflective purposes, reduces the need for creational design patterns such as Abstract Factory and simplifies configuration code, particularly for unit tests. We present benchmarks showing that Seuss introduces a 34 % additional memory cost, and runs at 53 % speed, without any optimizations. © JOT 2011.","Schwarz N., Lungu M., Nierstrasz O.",2012,Scopus,10.5381/jot.2012.11.1.a3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861705709&doi=10.5381%2fjot.2012.11.1.a3&partnerID=40&md5=5cf3d43df7ed499492a1027be0717d7c
Light output enhancement of GaN-based light-emitting diodes by optimizing SiO 2 nanorod-array depth patterned sapphire substrate,"In this study, we investigated high-efficiency InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) grown on sapphire substrates with SiO 2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) of different heights. The GaN film showed an improved crystal quality through X-ray diffraction (XRD) full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), photoluminescence (PL), and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. The light output power and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the fabricated LEDs were increased when compared with those of conventional LEDs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images suggested that the voids between SiO 2 nanorods and the stacking faults introduced during the nanoscale epitaxial lateral overgrowth (NELOG) of GaN can effectively reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD). We believe that the improvements could be attributed to both the enhanced light extraction by utilizing SiO 2 NRAs and the improved crystal quality through the NELOG method. We found that the sample with SiO 2 NRA structures of 200nm height can increase the LED output power by more than 70% in our study. © 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Chiu C.-H., Tu P.-M., Chang S.-P., Lin C.-C., Jang C.-Y., Li Z.-Y., Yang H.-C., Zan H.-W., Kuo H.-C., Lu T.-C., Wang S.-C., Chang C.-Y.",2012,Scopus,10.1143/JJAP.51.04DG11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860356201&doi=10.1143%2fJJAP.51.04DG11&partnerID=40&md5=0e0f190fe3cc6703293a4854231b01d6

Design and treatment effect of constructed wetland wastewater disposal project in Yangzhen no.l middle school of Beijing,"With the economic development of rural areas of China, rural water pollution becomes increasingly serious so that finding the suitable waste water treatment technology is imperative. Constructed wetland, as a kind of waste water treatment technologies with high efficiency and low cost, is widely used to treat different types of waste water. Because of the fact that Beijing residents in rural areas are relatively scattered and centralizing waste water is difficult, economical and easily constructed wetland project was carried out in Yang zhen No.l Middle School of Beijing. The aim of this research is to make foundation for the applicatioiLof constructed wetland in northern area of China. The project is consisted of buried integrative pretreatment system, multi-level complex constructed wetland system and wetland landscape system. Its effective area is 400 m 2. It can be divided into two east-west parallel connected systems with the 1 : 1 ratio of the length to the width. Each system is composed of many various subsurface flow wetlands in different orders, such as the vertical downward flow wetland and vertical upward flow wetland, and horizontal flow wetland. The paper presents detailed analysis of the constructed wetland location, mechanism design, water sample collection, test analysis, feature and the essentials. Through unit test, some innovations are made in packing structure, plant selection, water distribution design, water level regulation, designing system of preventing wetland from blocking and the design of pretreatment system. The effect of hydraulic retention time (1 day, 2 days and 3 days) on waste removal is analyzed. The constructed wetlands substrate clogging experiment, winter insulation measurement research, and studies on the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wetlands are carried out. The processing effect of the constructed wetland and the hydraulic retention time is closely related. Two days of the hydraulic retention time is suitable to the removal of chemical oxygen demand. In constructed wetland, 0-10 m horizontal distance, 0-5 cm, 30-35 cm, and 60-65 cm depth matrix blockage dates are significantly different (n=9, p &lt; 0.05). The most obvious matrix blockage occurs at 0 m, 2 m and 4 m. So if matrix needs changing, the only thing to do is to change 0-4 m to save spending and reduce disturbance to the normal operation of the constructed wetland. In winter, film cover system and ice cover system can both increase the removal rate of total nitrogen. Generally speaking, film cover system is better and more suitable for the northern area, because there are many merits of the film cover system. It can run uninterruptedly and easily. Plants do not plant again. What is more, it costs little. Buried integrative pretreatment system, multi-level complex constructed wetland system and wetland landscape system can treat waste water jointly so that the effluent can meet Beijing waste water discharge first-level B (total nitrogen content is 20 mg/L, total phosphorus content is 0.5 mg/L).The three characteristics of the waste water disposal project are as follows. First of all, winter pipe system and winter insulation measurements, such as film cover system and ice cover system, are used to make sure the constructed wetland system can run normally in winter. Secondly, many aeration measurements have been taken in the constructed wetland system and the constructed wetlands substrate clogging experiment is carried out to prevent the constructed wetland substrate from jamming. Thirdly, wetland landscape system is built to treat waste water further and increase the environment biodiversity. The design of the waste water disposal project is rational and the parameter is feasible, so it can be used as a pattern in northern area of China.","Li J., Jiang B.-B., Wang F.-Y., Tan Y.-C., Hong J.-M.",2012,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859954687&partnerID=40&md5=4d4e5044eea9b6e4f8f8dfbd5281c9eb
Characteristics of epitaxial lateral overgrowth AlN templates on (111)Si substrates for AlGaN deep-UV LEDs fabricated on different direction stripe patterns,"We investigated the characteristics of epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) AlN templates fabricated on Si substrates which are applicable to AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs). ELO-AlN layers were grown on stripe-patterned thin AlN seed-layer directly deposited on (111)Si substrates by using an 'NH 3 pulsed-flow multi-layer (ML) growth' technique. A 4 μm-thick ELO-AlN layer with stripe pattern along &lt;10-10&gt; direction of AlN can be coalesced successfully. We achieved marked reduction of crack and threading dislocation density (TDD) in the ELO AlN layers. In fact, the (10-12) full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray diffraction ω-scan rocking curves (XRCs) of ELO-AlN template on Si substrate was reduced to be 980 arcsec. These results show that the combination of NH 3 pulsed-flow ML growth and ELO method is effective to fabricate high-quality AlN templates on Si substrates. Moreover we fabricated 256-278 nm AlGaN quantum well (QW) DUV LEDs on the low TDD ELO-AlN templates on Si, and achieved single-peak operations under room temperature (RT) cw current injection. The low cost AlGaN based DUV LEDs on Si substrates is expected to be integrated with Si based electric devices on the same chips. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Low threading dislocation Ge on Si by combining deposition and etching,"Blanket and selective Ge growth on Si is investigated using reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition. To reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) at low thickness, Ge deposition with cyclic annealing followed by HCl etching is performed. In the case of blanket Ge deposition, a TDD of 1.3 × 106 cm- 2 is obtained, when the Ge layer is etched back from 4.5 μm thickness to 1.8 μm. The TDD is not increased relative to the situation before etching. The root mean square of roughness of the 1.8 μm thick Ge is about 0.46 nm, which is of the same level as before HCl etching. Further etching shows increased surface roughness caused by non-uniform strain distribution near the interface due to misfit dislocations and threading dislocations. The TDD also becomes higher because the etchfront of Ge reaches areas with high dislocation density near the interface. In the case of selective Ge growth, a slightly lower TDD is observed in smaller windows caused by a weak pattern size dependence on Ge thickness. A significant decrease of TDD of selectively grown Ge is also observed by increasing the Ge thickness. An about 10 times lower TDD at the same Ge thickness is demonstrated by applying a combination of deposition and etching processes during selective Ge growth. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Characterization of defects in Mg doped GaN epitaxial layers using conductance measurements,"Mg-doped GaN films have been grown on sapphire by metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. Two different buffer layer schemes between the film and the sapphire substrate were used, giving rise to differing threading dislocation densities (TDDs) in the GaN. Frequency-dependent capacitance and conductance measurements have been used to study the electronic states associated with the Mg doping, and to determine how these are affected by the TDD. Current-voltage and admittance spectroscopy measurements were carried out using Al/Au Schottky contacts and Ni/Au Ohmic contacts fabricated in a dot-and-ring pattern. Frequency-dependent measurements on these devices were corrected to remove the series resistance effects arising from the well known high resistivity of Mg-doped GaN using formulae derived from the equivalent parallel circuit model. Thermal admittance spectroscopy, in which the conductance is monitored as a function of temperature, verified the existence of a single impurity-related acceptor level in samples with different TDDs at 165 ± 10 meV. For all of the samples the extrapolated capture cross-section values were very small, in the range of ∼ 10 - 20 cm - 2, suggesting that the acceptor level could be very repulsive. Since admittance spectroscopy detects only majority carrier traps, we believe these defect signature values are most probably associated with the Mg acceptor state as they are very close to the results previously reported by other research groups using different techniques. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Toward an education of consequence: Connecting assessment, teaching, and learning","What seems clear is that these older progressive changes in the ways assessment was thought about and practiced demanded a major shift in the teachinglearning encounter. It was not merely a change in the form of tests being used or the ways students were graded. It had more to do with students assuming much more active roles, becoming the primary workers, engaged in content issues that mattered to them; a curriculum that was flexibly organized and called upon students to actually demonstrate their understandings, with uncoverage as opposed to coverage of content assuming prominence; and teachers learning to live with more uncertainty, being willing to alter-generally slow down-their pace, accepting the fact that students might pursue different directions, different topics, possibly learn different things. The shift in patterns and responsibilities was large. What we should learn from the earlier experience is that a more productive system of assessment only makes sense if the teaching-learning exchange itself is equally powerful. Why develop, for example, portfolios of students’ work if the work students are asked to complete is primarily sets of worksheets? Why record student presentations if the presentations are on topics about which the students had little choice and have little interest? Why ask students to select “best work’' and share with their parents how they selected their work if they haven’t had the time or resources to complete work they, in fact, honor and see as important? Having a system-wide spelling list from which there will be a test each Friday, having a standard textbook with unit tests and year-end tests to prepare students for, having a predetermined set of topics to study along with a list of things every child should clearly know, leaves teachers with greater certainty and with less to invent, stay in touch with, observe, respond to. Given the organization of schools, it is not surprising that the less complex patterns of assessment, curriculum, and pedagogy remained dominant in the earlier period, even as teachers and schools here and there pursued more progressive possibilities. Conditions may not now be so different from then. © 1997 by Routledge.

Testing object-oriented configurators with ASP,"Testing is an important aspect of every software project. For configurator applications it is equally important but often neglected. This paper shows how to support testing object-oriented and constraint-based configurators by automatically generating positive and negative test cases using answer set programming (ASP). The object-model of the configurator is mapped to ASP code; the constraints to be tested are coded redundantly in ASP. Based on that, the ASP solver generates appropriate test cases, which are then used for unit testing in the object-oriented configurator. There are different strategies to improve this basic process, e.g. reduction of the number of test cases with symmetry breaking.","Falkner A.A., Schenner G., Friedrich G., Ryabokon A.",2012,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84922710201&partnerID=40&md5=53c19ccc41bf41fab88eb6ddc2db2fa4
Parametric laboratory evaluation of residential heat pump water heaters,"Three Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH) units, representing the initial domestic offerings by the major manufacturers, were evaluated using a parametric test matrix. The three units tested vary in: refrigerant used, compressor size, evaporator fan size, amount of onboard electric resistance heat, condenser design, storage tank size, number and type of appliance (control) settings, and other factors that influence performance. The focus of this laboratory testing was the influence of appliance setting and hot water draw pattern on HPWH performance and efficiency, with limited variation of ambient enthalpy (within an environmental chamber), water main temperature, and thermostat setpoint. Additionally, the space conditioning effect of each unit was quantified through extended testing at stable conditions. A range of performance and efficiency was observed for each unit, both above and below results under standardized test metrics. Observations were also made of the manner in which the three HPWHs manage their thermal stores across varied demand, operational conditions, and HPWH system designs. ©2012 ASHRAE.","Glanville P., Kosar D., Suchorabski D.",2012,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864978470&partnerID=40&md5=c983715c524e9f9475cad2401a5ba241
A test case refactoring approach for pattern-based software development,"In the current trend, Extreme Programing methodology is widely adopted by small and medium-sized projects for dealing with rapidly or indefinite changing requirements. Test-first strategy and code refactoring are the important practices of Extreme Programing for rapid development and quality support. The test-first strategy emphasizes that test cases are designed before system implementation to keep the correctness of artifacts during software development; whereas refactoring is the removal of ""bad smell"" code for improving quality without changing its semantics. However, the test-first strategy may conflict with code refactoring in the sense that the original test cases may be broken or inefficient for testing programs, which are revised by code refactoring. In general, the developers revise the test cases manually since it is not complicated. However, when the developers perform a pattern-based refactoring to improve the quality, the effort of revising the test cases is much more than that in simple code refactoring. In our observation, a pattern-based refactoring is composed of many simple and atomic code refactorings. If we have the composition relationship and the mapping rules between code refactoring and test case refactoring, we may infer a test case revision guideline in pattern-based refactoring. Based on this idea, in this research, we propose a four-phase approach to guide the construction of the test case refactoring for design patterns. We also introduce our approach by using some well-known design patterns and evaluate its feasibility by means of test coverage. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Chu P.-H., Hsueh N.-L., Chen H.-H., Liu C.-H.",2012,Scopus,10.1007/s11219-011-9143-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855415766&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-011-9143-x&partnerID=40&md5=ca06ab5fac0ff1676af885e8545382eb
Test driven development of model transformation with reusable patterns,"In order to easily port mobile applications suitable for each platform, that have been developed under diverse development environment for individual wireless communication service providers, or redevelop them on a specific platform, it is required to reuse them at software model level that is a software development paradigm for MDA (Model Driven Architecture).

Test driven development: Advancing knowledge by conjecture and confirmation,"Test Driven Development (TDD) is a critical agile software development practice that supports innovation in short development cycles. However, TDD is one of the most challenging agile practices to adopt because it requires changes to work practices and skill sets. It is therefore important to gain an understanding of TDD through the experiences of those who have successfully adopted this practice. We collaborated with an agile team to provide this experience report on their adoption of TDD, using observations and interviews within the product development environment. This article highlights a number of practices that underlie successful development with TDD. To provide a theoretical perspective that can help to explain how TDD supports a positive philosophy of software development, we have revised Northover et al.’s conceptual framework, which is based on a four stage model of agile development, to reinterpret Popper’s theory of conjecture and falsification in the context of agile testing strategies. As a result of our findings, we propose an analytical model for TDD in agile software development which provides a theoretical basis for further investigations into the role of TDD and related practices. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Parsons D., Lal R., Lange M.",2011,Scopus,10.3390/fi3040281,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052344770&doi=10.3390%2ffi3040281&partnerID=40&md5=7d5f754defe404246d2bded8ba5fbe1e
Designing multi-agent unit tests using systematic test design patterns,"Following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows Multi-Agent System (MAS) developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the junit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide an analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations. © 2011 IADIS.","Nagi K.M., Khamis M.A.",2011,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865088554&partnerID=40&md5=32d3ab6856d22c3a62b37298a05612f8
Scaling up automated test generation: Automatically generating maintainable regression unit tests for programs,"This paper presents an automatic technique for generating maintainable regression unit tests for programs. We found previous test generation techniques inadequate for two main reasons. First. they were designed for and evaluated upon libraries rather than applications. Second, they were designed to find bugs rather than to create maintainable regression test suites: the test suites that they generated were brittle and hard to understand. This paper presents a suite of techniques that address these problems by enhancing an existing unit test generation system. In experiments using an industrial system, the generated tests achieved good coverage and mutation kill score, were readable by the product's developers, and required few edits as the system under test evolved.

Innovative design of hollow polymeric microneedles for transdermal drug delivery,"Hypodermic injections give the best results in terms of drug administration efficiency, but benefit from a negative image among patients due to the fear of pain linked to needles. Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) has thus been greatly developed in the past ten years in order to be able to by-pass the skin protective layers in a minimally invasive way. With the advent of micro electro mechanical systems, opportunities have appeared, particularly in the area of microneedles. In this paper we present a new design of hollow polymeric microneedles aimed at being used for TDD by allowing injection of a liquid in the non-innerve part of the dermis. The design has been studied in order to be able to manufacture these microneedles arrays using techniques that may be applicable to industrial production at low cost. The envisioned microfabrication processes and their stacking are presented which involve injection micromolding and excimer laser ablation. Microneedles are also numerically characterized in terms of mechanics and microfluidics showing that the design also involves interesting features in terms of needles resistance and microfluidic. Due to the innovative double-molding technique, the micro-needles are indeed emptied leaving a cavity. An outlet channel on the side of the needle allows fluid flowing out of the needles. The characteristics of this outlet channel contribute to flow homogenization when several needles are placed in an array pattern. This microneedle design thus combines interesting characteristics in terms of ease of fabrication at large scale, mechanical resistance and fluid dynamics. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Sausse Lhernould M., Delchambre A.",2011,Scopus,10.1007/s00542-011-1355-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80755153550&doi=10.1007%2fs00542-011-1355-2&partnerID=40&md5=9a9cccdfbcb5f5f5c283522344fd3a1f

Automatic partial loop summarization in dynamic test generation,"Whitebox fuzzing extends dynamic test generation based on symbolic execution and constraint solving from unit testing to whole-application security testing. Unfortunately, input-dependent loops may cause an explosion in the number of constraints to be solved and in the number of execution paths to be explored. In practice, whitebox fuzzers arbitrarily bound the number of constraints and paths due to input-dependent loops, at the risk of missing code and bugs. In this work, we investigate the use of simple loop-guard pattern-matching rules to automatically guess an input constraint defining the number of iterations of input-dependent loops during dynamic symbolic execution. We discover the loop structure of the program on the fly, detect induction variables, which are variables modified by a constant value during loop iterations, and infer simple partial loop invariants relating the value of such variables. Whenever a guess is confirmed later during the current dynamic symbolic execution, we then inject new constraints representing pre and post loop conditions, effectively summarizing sets of executions of that loop. These pre and post conditions are derived from partial loop invariants synthesized dynamically using pattern-matching rules on the loop guards and induction variables, without requiring any static analysis, theorem proving, or input-format specification.

High coverage testing of Haskell programs,"This paper presents a new lightweight technique for automatically generating high coverage test suites for Haskell library code. Our approach combines four main features to increase test coverage: (1) automatically inferring the constructors and functions needed to generate test data; (2) using needed narrowing to take advantage of Haskell's lazy evaluation semantics; (3) inspecting elements inside returned data structures through the use of case statements, and (4) efficiently handling polymorphism by lazily instantiating all possible instances. We have implemented this technique in IRULAN, a fully automatic tool for systematic black-box unit testing of Haskell library code. We have designed IRULAN to generate high coverage test suites and detect common programming errors in the process. We have applied IRULAN to over 50 programs from the spectral and real suites of the nofib benchmark and show that it can effectively generate high-coverage test suites - exhibiting 70.83% coverage for spectral and 59.78% coverage for real - and find errors in these programs. Our techniques are general enough to be useful for several other types of testing, and we also discuss our experience of using IRULAN for property and regression testing. © 2011 ACM.","Allwood T., Cadar C., Eisenbach S.",2011,Scopus,10.1145/2001420.2001465,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051935242&doi=10.1145%2f2001420.2001465&partnerID=40&md5=61c05f1895c5f8e4f1ffef3b83c3246c
Generating parameterized unit tests,"State-of-the art techniques for automated test generation focus on generating executions that cover program behavior. As they do not generate oracles, it is up to the developer to figure out what a test does and how to check the correctness of the observed behavior. In this paper, we present an approach to generate parameterized unit tests - unit tests containing symbolic pre- and postconditions characterizing test input and test result. Starting from concrete inputs and results, we use test generation and mutation to systematically generalize pre- and postconditions while simplifying the computation steps. Evaluated on five open source libraries, the generated parameterized unit tests are (a) more expressive, characterizing general rather than concrete behavior; (b) need fewer computation steps, making them easier to understand; and (c) achieve a higher coverage than regular unit tests. © 2011 ACM.","Fraser G., Zeller A.",2011,Scopus,10.1145/2001420.2001464,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051920892&doi=10.1145%2f2001420.2001464&partnerID=40&md5=ebc9b4ec4aee72a55a0a8067bbaa4e67
Seuss: Better class responsibilities through language-based dependency injection,"Unit testing is often made more difficult by the heavy use of classes as namespaces and the proliferation of static methods to encapsulate configuration code. We have analyzed the use of 120 static methods from 96 projects by categorizing them according to their responsibilities. We find that most static methods support a hodgepodge of mixed responsibilities, held together only by their common need to be globally visible. Tight coupling between instances and their classes breaks encapsulation, and, together with the global visibility of static methods, complicates testing. By making dependency injection a feature of the programming language, we can get rid of static methods altogether. We employ the following semantic changes: (1) Replace every occurrence of a global with an access to an instance variable; (2) Let that instance variable be automatically injected into the object when it is instantiated. We present Seuss, a prototype that implements this change of semantics in Smalltalk. We show how Seuss eliminates the need to use class methods for non-reflective purposes, reduces the need for creational design patterns such as Abstract Factory and simplifies configuration code, particularly for unit tests. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Schwarz N., Lungu M., Nierstrasz O.",2011,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-642-21952-8_20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960185512&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-21952-8_20&partnerID=40&md5=00f933df66550468ea278bfb1aef670a

HVPE growth of thick AlN on trench-patterned substrate,"We have fabricated low threading dislocation density (TDD) and crack-free thick AlN films on trench-patterned AlN templates for application to deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by employing an epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) process. Using AlN templates with various stripe structures formed along the <10-10> direction, We systematically investigated mechanism of void structure formed by the ELO process. It was found that the height of void-tops was proportional to the groove width and the growth rate ratio of vertical to lateral. And, the height of void-bottoms was proportional to the parameter defined as the square of groove-width divided by the groove-depth. Furthermore, the growth rate ratio of vertical to lateral lowered with increasing growth temperature, and heightened with decreasing V/III ratio. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"The influence of paleofloods on archaeological settlement patterns during A.D. 1050-1170 along the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA","Excavations at four archaeological sites consisting of the material remains of A.D. 1050-1170 era farmers along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park, yield geomorphic information used to address questions related to settlement patterns. Archaeological excavation units, test pits, feature fill, and natural exposures contain sediments used to interpret geomorphic history that can, in turn, shed light on archaeological site selection in a challenging environment. The Grand Canyon experiences dramatic geomorphic events such as catastrophic floods and destructive debris flows that are preserved in the stratigraphic record, and can be used to understand cultural/landscape interactions. By combining new geomorphic, stratigraphic, and archaeological data collected during recent excavations with results from previous geomorphic and sediment transport studies, observed trends can be interpreted regarding the possible influence of paleofloods on past settlement patterns. For example, at each of the four sites, reconstructed paleoflood elevations (from existing HEC-RAS virtual shorelines), flood recurrence intervals, site layout, and site stratigraphy/geomorphic setting suggests a temporal trend in site location. The two early sites (Early Pueblo II period: A.D. 1050-1080) contain habitation features located above the approximately 6-8. year high flood (3500. cubic meters per second [cms]) recurrence interval; larger floods (4800 to 5900. cms) of a longer recurrence interval between 40 and 80. years inundate these features. The two later sites in the sample (Late Pueblo II; A.D. 1080-1170) contain habitation features located well above the 40-80. year recurrence high flows. We suggest that early farmers (Early Pueblo II period: A.D. 1050-1080) may not have had adequate experience with flood magnitudes and frequencies and therefore their habitation structures were located in risk-prone areas relatively close to the river. Later habitations (Late Pueblo II; A.D. 1080-1170) were positioned in more protected areas further from the river, perhaps reflecting an acquired knowledge of river dynamics. These trends, although currently based on a limited data set, provide insights into site selection decisions and settlement patterns of early farmers along the Colorado River through Grand Canyon. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Anderson K.C., Neff T.",2011,Scopus,10.1016/j.catena.2010.12.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79951948984&doi=10.1016%2fj.catena.2010.12.004&partnerID=40&md5=d2023714763b637ff98cbeb7c886ab2c
Enhanced cross-entropy method for dynamic economic dispatch with valve-point effects,"This paper proposes an enhanced cross-entropy (ECE) method to solve dynamic economic dispatch (DED) problem with valve-point effects. The cross-entropy (CE) method, originated from an adaptive variance minimization algorithm for estimating probabilities of rare events, is a generic approach to combinatorial and multi-extremal optimization. Exploration capability of CE algorithm is enhanced in this paper by using chaotic sequence and the resultant ECE is applied to DED with valve-point effects. The performance of the proposed ECE method is rigorously tested for optimality, convergence, robustness and computational efficiency on a 10-unit test system. Additional test cases with different load patterns and increased number of generators are also solved by ECE. Numerical results show that the proposed ECE approach finds high-quality solutions reliably with faster convergence. It outperforms CE and all the previous approaches. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Data clustering in C++: An object-oriented approach,"Data clustering is a highly interdisciplinary field, the goal of which is to divide a set of objects into homogeneous groups such that objects in the same group are similar and objects in different groups are quite distinct. Thousands of theoretical papers and a number of books on data clustering have been published over the past 50 years. However, few books exist to teach people how to implement data clustering algorithms. This book was written for anyone who wants to implement or improve their data clustering algorithms. Using object-oriented design and programming techniques, Data Clustering in C++: An Object-Oriented Approach exploits the commonalities of all data clustering algorithms to create a flexible set of reusable classes that simplifies the implementation of any data clustering algorithm. Readers can follow the development of the base data clustering classes and several popular data clustering algorithms. Additional topics such as data pre-processing, data visualization, cluster visualization, and cluster interpretation are briefly covered. This book is divided into three parts— • Data Clustering and C++ Preliminaries: A review of basic concepts of data clustering, the unified modeling language, object-oriented programming in C++, and design patterns • A C++ Data Clustering Framework: The development of data clustering base classes • Data Clustering Algorithms: The implementation of several popular data clustering algorithms A key to learning a clustering algorithm is to implement and experiment the clustering algorithm.

Neuroscience research advances,"Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system. Survival infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at significant risk for neurodevelopmental impairment, either as a result of in utero physiological effects of abnormal circulation, associated congenital brain anomalies, neurodevelopmental compromise before, during and after surgical repair, or combinations of all these factors. This book examines the neurodevelopmental outcomes for patients with CHD, risk factors for adverse neurodevelopmental sequelae and peri- and intraoperative neuromonitoring and neuroprotective strategies. Furthermore, electroencephalography (EEG) has been utilized for decades in the neonatal intensive care unit to assess brain maturation, detect and localize brain injury, diagnose seizures and give prognostic information. This book reviews specific EEG/aEEG patterns and their value in predicting long term neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants. Also examined are the risks and benefits of physical activity in epileptics, sports in which epileptics may participate and the positive effect of physical exercise in experimental models of epilepsy. Other chapters in this book examine the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, tangle dominant dementia (TDD), a sporadic subtype of late onset progressive dementia, the effects of methylphenidate (MPD) treatment in adolescence on MPD response in adulthood, and a discussion of the ""neurodevelopmental abnormality"" theory, which proposes that some schizophrenics suffer from subtle neurodevelopmental insults during fetal development. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A well-designed BC determines accurate bolus doses for carbohydrate intake and for correcting elevated glucose levels. It should also provide the logic necessary to track residual bolus insulin and reduce bolus recommendations to minimize insulin stacking. To provide appropriate bolus doses, a BC requires accurate settings for the carbohydrate factor or insulin:carbohydrate ratio, glucose correction factor, duration of insulin action, and correction target.

JMLUnit: The next generation,"Designing unit test suites for object-oriented systems is a painstaking, repetitive, and error-prone task, and significant research has been devoted to the automatic generation of test suites. One method for generating unit tests is to use formal class and method specifications as test oracles and automatically run them with developer-provided data values; for Java code with formal specifications written in the Java Modeling Language, this method is embodied in the JMLUnit tool and the JUnit testing framework on which it is based. While JMLUnit can provide reasonable test coverage when used by a skilled developer, it suffers from several shortcomings including excessive memory utilization during testing and the need to manually write significant amounts of code to generate non-primitive test data objects. In this paper we describe JMLUnitNG, a TestNG-based successor to JMLUnit that can automatically generate and execute millions of tests, using supplied test data of only primitive types, without consuming excessive amounts of memory. We also present a comparison of test coverage between JMLUnitNG and the original JMLUnit. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Zimmerman D.M., Nagmoti R.",2011,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-642-18070-5_13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79551608227&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-18070-5_13&partnerID=40&md5=94b2f4298e38c35eaa9253db5e609c2f
Cost/revenue tradeoff in the optimization of fixed WiMAX deployment with relays,"In fixed Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), the contribution from each transmission mode can be incorporated into an implicit formulation to obtain the supported throughput as a function of the carrier-to-interference ratio. This is done by weighting the physical throughput in each concentric coverage ring by the size of the ring. In this paper, multihop cells are formed by a central coverage zone and three outer coverage zones, which are served by cheaper low-complexity relays. Although the reuse distance in this case is augmented by a factor of √3, we show that, with the use of relays in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) mode with an adapted time-division duplexing (TDD) uplink (UL) subframe structure to accommodate communication from/to the relay station (RS) to/from subscriber station (SS), only the consideration of trisectored base stations (BSs) with a reuse pattern of K = 3 enables attainment of values for the cell per sector throughput that is comparable with cases without the use of relays. Cost/revenue optimization results show that trisectored BSs in topologies with relays enable us to achieve more profitable reuse configurations than with omnidirectional BSs and no relays. Under the same total bandwidth and with the coverage distance set at R ∼ 500 m, we show that it is preferable to consider K = 1 with three carriers per sector instead of K = 3 with one carrier per sector, whereby the profit in this case is increased from ∼1000% to ∼1450%. Furthermore, if the price [in (€/MB)] is increased from 0.0025 to 0.005, the achievable profit more than doubles. © 2010 IEEE.","Velez F.J., Nazir M.K., Aghvami A.H., Holland O., Robalo D.",2011,Scopus,10.1109/TVT.2010.2083707,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78751666260&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2010.2083707&partnerID=40&md5=fe91fe2f56e5e2b4ceb3d537663f12e4

Designs of precoding for LTE TDD using cell specific reference signals,"We design non-codebook-based Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) precoding schemes using multiple cell-specific reference signals patterns for the time division duplex (TDD) mode of LTE, where channel reciprocity can be exploited. Previously proposed non-codebook-based precoding schemes typically use UE specific reference signals for demodulation. Cell specific reference signals are however always allocated for the transmission of common control signalling, mobility measurements and downlink channel quality measurements. In order to save the resources occupied by UE specific reference signals, and to simplify UE implementation, a precoder-estimation scheme and a codebook-assisted scheme are designed. The codebook-assisted scheme has the novelty of using a codebook in equalization.

Generating integration test cases automatically,"In this thesis, I investigate the problem of automatically generating test cases. In particular, I focus on the problem of automatic generation of integration test cases from unit test cases. I start from the observation that software is usually provided with many unit test cases, and that unit test cases carry a lot of information about the unit execution that can be used to generate integration test cases. This paper illustrates the approach that I am investigating and that consists in capturing information in unit test cases with static analysis techniques to automatically merge unit test cases to produce useful integration test cases. The preliminary results reported in this paper provide evidence of the effectiveness of the approach. My current research is developing the approach further and producing additional experimental evidence. I expect to complete the research by defining a set of design for testability rules to produce software that facilitates the automatic generation of integration test cases.

Parameterized unit testing with Pex: Tutorial,"This hands-on tutorial teaches the principles of Parameterized Unit Testing in Visual Studio with Pex, an automatic test input generator. A parameterized unit test (PUT) is simply a method that takes parameters, calls the code under test, and states assertions. Given a PUT written in a .NET language, Pex automatically produces a small test suite with high code and assertion coverage.Moreover, when a generated test fails, Pex can often suggest a bug fix. To do so, Pex performs a systematic program analysis, similar to path bounded model-checking. Pex learns the program behavior by monitoring execution traces, and uses a constraint solver to produce new test cases with different behavior.

Two frequency reuse schemes in OFDMA-TDD based two-hop relay networks,"Frequency reuse scheme is extremely important in multi-hop relay networks (MRNs), because some extra frequency resource should be elaborately allocated to Relay Stations (RSs). However the time and spatial reuse characteristics of RS should be taken into account in order to mitigate the co-channel interference. This paper presents two adaptive frequency reuse schemes for MRN by using different reuse patterns in different time zones of the same frame. In our schemes, reuse pattern of 1x3x1 is applied in the Relay Zone (RZ), and 1x3x3 is applied in the Access Zone (AZ). The former allows only the two RSs which are located farthest apart in one cell to share the same frequency portion; while in the latter two adjacent RSs may share the same resources. Analysis and simulation results show that both schemes improve the system throughput greatly. The comparison of coverage and throughput between the two schemes indicates that the latter scheme has better performance and an aggressive full reuse scheme could be utilized to all RSs. ©2010 IEEE.","Zhao Z., Fang X., Zhu Y., Long Y.",2010,Scopus,10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506111,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955026120&doi=10.1109%2fWCNC.2010.5506111&partnerID=40&md5=e8d1e5659047e51c05f0467998978641
Automatically extracting mock object behavior from Design by Contract™ specification for test data generation,"Test data generation is an important task in the process of automated unit test generation. Random and heuristic approaches are well known for test input data generation. Unfortunately, in the presence of complex pre-conditions especially in the case of non-primitive data types those approaches often fail. A promising technique for generating an object that exactly satisfies a given pre-condition is mocking, i.e., replacing the concrete implementation with an implementation only considering the necessary behavior for a specific test case. In this paper we follow this technique and present an approach for automatically deriving the behavior of mock objects from given Design by Contract™ specifications. The generated mock objects behave according to the Design by Contract™ specification of the original class. Furthermore, we make sure that the observed behavior of the mock object satisfies the pre-condition of the method under test. We evaluate the approach using the Java implementations of 20 common Design Patterns and a stack based calculator. Our approach clearly outperforms pure random data generation in terms of line coverage.

DyGen: Automatic generation of high-coverage tests via mining gigabytes of dynamic traces,"Unit tests of object-oriented code exercise particular sequences of method calls. A key problem when automatically generating unit tests that achieve high structural code coverage is the selection of relevant method-call sequences, since the number of potentially relevant sequences explodes with the number of methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, called DyGen, that generates tests via mining dynamic traces recorded during program executions. Typical program executions tend to exercise only happy paths that do not include error-handling code, and thus recorded traces often do not achieve high structural coverage.

IMUnit: Improved multithreaded unit testing,"This position paper argues for an approach to bring several techniques successful for (regression) testing of sequential code over to multithreaded code. Multithreaded code is getting increasingly important but remains extremely hard to develop and test. Most recent research on testing multithreaded code focuses solely on finding bugs in one given version of code. While there are many promising results, the tools are fairly slow (as they, conceptually, explore a large number of schedules) and do not exploit the fact that code evolves over several versions during development and maintenance. Our proposal is to allow explicit specification of relevant schedules (either manually written or automatically generated) for multithreaded tests, which can substantially speed up testing, especially for evolving code. To enable the use of schedules, we propose to design a novel language for specifying schedules in multithreaded tests, and to develop tools for automatic generation of multithreaded tests and for improved regression testing with multithreaded tests. © 2010 ACM.","Jagannath V., Gligoric M., Jin D., Rosu G., Marinov D.",2010,Scopus,10.1145/1808954.1808966,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954598990&doi=10.1145%2f1808954.1808966&partnerID=40&md5=bd90f508ef1795345f95b7cdfcc74c2e

A lightweight and portable approach to making concurrent failures reproducible,"Concurrent programs often exhibit bugs due to unintended interferences among the concurrent threads. Such bugs are often hard to reproduce because they typically happen under very specific interleaving of the executing threads. Basically, it is very hard to fix a bug (or software failure) in concurrent programs without being able to reproduce it. In this paper, we present an approach, called ConCrash, that automatically and deterministically reproduces concurrent failures by recording logical thread schedule and generating unit tests. For a given bug (failure), ConCrash records the logical thread scheduling order and preserves object states in memory at runtime. Then, ConCrash reproduces the failure offline by simply using the saved information without the need for JVM-level or OS-level support. To reduce the runtime performance overhead, ConCrash employs a static data race detection technique to report potential possible race conditions, and only instruments such places. We implement the ConCrash approach in a prototype tool for Java and experimented on a number of multi-threaded Java benchmarks. As a result, we successfully reproduced a number of real concurrent bugs (e.g., deadlocks, data races and atomicity violation) within an acceptable overhead. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Luo Q., Zhang S., Zhao J., Hu M.",2010,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-642-12029-9_23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77951292783&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-12029-9_23&partnerID=40&md5=fe4ebe11a4a2cdafd53a35753ec178c8
The axioms strike back: Testing with concepts and axioms in C++,"Modern development practises encourage extensive testing of code while it is still under development, using unit tests to check individual code units in isolation. Such tests are typically case-based, checking a likely error scenario or an error that has previously been identified and fixed. Coming up with good test cases is challenging, and focusing on individual tests can distract from creating tests that cover the full functionality. Axioms, known from program specification, allow for an alternative way of generating test cases, where the intended functionality is described as rules or equations that can be checked automatically. Axioms are proposed as part of the concept feature of the upcoming C++0x standard. In this paper, we describe how tests may be generated automatically from axioms in C++ concepts, and supplied with appropriate test data to form exctive automated unit tests.

Impact of Local-oscillator imperfections on nonregenerative TDD and FDD relaying,"In this work we investigate the impact of imperfect local oscillators (LOs) at the relays in nonregenerative two-hop networks. Due to the specific traffic pattern of multihop networks, hardware imperfections at the relays have a different impact on the system than hardware imperfections at the sources and destinations. Based on the assumption that one LO generates all oscillations in each node, we consider baseband sampling time as well as sampling frequency offsets, RF frequency and phase offsets, timing errors, and phase noise. In the presence of these imperfections, time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) relays introduce errors to their forwarded signals. We identify these errors for both types of relays and use Monte-Carlo simulations to compare the performance of a multiuser network employing either TDD or FDD relays with imperfect LOs. © 2010 IEEE.","Berger S., Wittneben A.",2010,Scopus,10.1109/VETECS.2010.5494086,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116007899&doi=10.1109%2fVETECS.2010.5494086&partnerID=40&md5=f03e8a3f8bda889c51c6783bc3dfa131
"Design driven testing: Test smarter, not harder","The groundbreaking book Design Driven Testing brings sanity back to the software development process by flipping around the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD)-restoring the concept of using testing to verify a design instead of pretending that unit tests are a replacement for design. Anyone who feels that TDD is ""Too Damn Difficult"" will appreciate this book. Design Driven Testing shows that, by combining a forward-thinking development process with cutting-edge automation, testing can be a finely targeted, business-driven, rewarding effort. In other words, you'll learn how to test smarter, not harder. •Applies a feedback-driven approach to each stage of the project lifecycle. •Illustrates a lightweight and effective approach using a core subset of UML. •Follows a real-life example project using Java and Flex/ActionScript. •Presents bonus chapters for advanced DDTers covering unit-test antipatterns (and their opposite, ""test-conscious"" design patterns), and showing how to create your own test transformation templates in Enterprise Architect.

XUnit test patterns and smells improving the ROI of test code,"High quality automated unit tests are one of the key development practices that enable incremental development and delivery of software by reducing the number of bugs introduced into code as it is evolved. But writing lots of tests is not enough as the tests need to be maintained over the life of the software. This maintenance cost can quickly outweigh the benefits provided by the tests. XUnit is the generic name for the family of unit test frameworks that are now available in almost every programming language. JUnit, NUnit, MsTest and CppUnit are some of the better known members of the xUnit family. This tutorial provides the participants with a vocabulary of smells and patterns with which to reason about the quality of their xUnit test code and a set of reusable test code design patterns that can be used to eliminate the smells.

Antenna switching schemes for downlink time switched transmit diversity with ARQ in rayleigh fading channels,"For automatic repeat request (ARQ)-aided TSTD (Time Switched Transmit Diversity) system, a receiver sends the acknowledgement signal (ACK or NACK) to a transmitter in order to predict the condition of the channel.

An optimized cell BE special function library generated by coconut,"Abstract-Coconut, a tool for developing high-assurance, high-performance kernels for scientific computing, contains an extensible domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Haskell. The DSL supports interactive prototyping and unit testing, simplifying the process of designing efficient implementations of common patterns. Unscheduled C and scheduled assembly language output are supported. Using the patterns, even nonexpert users can write efficient function implementations, leveraging special hardware features. A production-quality library of elementary functions for the Cell BE SPU compute engines has been developed. Coconutgenerated and -scheduled vector functions were more than four times faster than commercially distributed functions written in C with intrinsics (a nicer syntax for in-line assembly), wrapped in loops and scheduled by spuxlc. All Coconut functions were faster, but the difference was larger for hard-to-approximate functions for which register-level SIMD lookups made a bigger difference. Other helpful features in the language include facilities for translating interval and polynomial descriptions between GHCi, a Haskell interpreter used to prototype in the DSL, and Maple, used for exploration and minimax polynomial generation. This makes it easier to match mathematical properties of the functions with efficient calculational patterns in the SPU ISA. By using single, literate source files, the resulting functions are remarkably readable. © 2009 IEEE.","Anand C.K., Kahl W.",2009,Scopus,10.1109/TC.2008.223,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77955079685&doi=10.1109%2fTC.2008.223&partnerID=40&md5=f4089a71df6a4f76864d79e8ed86e486

A parameterized unit test framework based on symbolic Java PathFinder,"Parameterized unit test recently gains a lot of attention as it saves testing cost and is more efficient in term of code coverage. We present a framework for running parameterized unit tests (PUT) based on Java PathFinder (JPF) and JUnit. Our approach bases on model checking and symbolic execution of JPF for generating standard unit tests. As a result, we achieve high structural and path coverage. The generated unit tests are automatically executed by JUnit so programmers receive immediately assertion failures if any.

Radioelectric compatibility of the future aeronautical communication system,"The aeronautical community has recently decided to develop a new digital aeronautical communication system, named L-DACS, in order to fulfill the new air traffic requirements. This system, which will operate in the L frequency band (960 to 1164 MHz), would be internationally deployed from 2020. Many technologies were considered for this new aeronautical system but only two among them were preselected by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO): candidate one, named L-DACS1, is based on a FDD-OFDM technology and candidate two, named L-DACS2, is based on a TDD-GMSK technology. One of the most important issues for both candidates is the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with the legacy systems operating in the same band or/and in adjacent bands. Different scenarios have to be evaluated due to the fact that these systems will be implanted either in the airplanes (on board) or in ground stations. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the air-air scenario, where we focus on the signals generated by onboard L-DACS transmitters on onboard victim receivers, taking into account the L-DACS antenna radiation pattern and the frequency mask.

Test data generation for derived types in C program,"Test data generation is one of the important tasks during software testing. This paper proposes an approach to generating test cases automatically for the unit test of C programs with derived types including pointers, structures and arrays. Our approach combines symbolic execution and concrete execution. The approach captures operations on variables precisely by concrete execution, and thus it is capable of handling derived types. Benefited from symbolic execution, accessing variables as array index can be solved by a substitution strategy. The substitution strategy also translates a path constraint involving variables of derived type to the one containing only primitive variables. An implementation of this approach is integrated into our test case generation tool called CAUT 1.Experimental results show that our approach is effective to generate test data for derived types. © 2009 IEEE.","Wang Z., Yu X., Sun T., Pu G., Ding Z., Hu J.",2009,Scopus,10.1109/TASE.2009.10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-71049164564&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2009.10&partnerID=40&md5=3e7bb4880ff0300998cdce51d7d4c4db

Defect reduction of laterally regrown GaN on GaN/patterned sapphire substrates,"Structural properties of GaN epilayers on wet-etched protruding and recess-patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs) have been investigated in detail using high-resolution double-crystal X-ray diffraction (DCXRD) and etch-pit density methods. The DCXRD results reveal various dislocation configurations on both types of PSSs. The etch pits of GaN on the recess PSS exhibit a regular distribution, i.e. less etch pits or threading dislocation density (TDD) onto the recess area than those onto the sapphire mesas. On the contrary, an irregular distribution is observed for the etch pits of GaN on the protruding PSS. A higher crystal quality of the GaN epilayer grown onto the recess PSS can be achieved as compared with that onto the protruding PSS. These data reflect that the GaN epilayer on the recess PSS could be a better template for the second epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) of GaN. As a result, the GaN epilayers after the ELOG process display the TDDs of around ∼106 cm-2. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Carving and replaying differential unit test cases from system test cases,"Unit test cases are focused and efficient. System tests are effective at exercising complex usage patterns. Differential unit tests (DUT) are a hybrid of unit and system tests that exploits their strengths. They are generated by carving the system components, while executing a system test case, that influence the behavior of the target unit, and then re-assembling those components so that the unit can be exercised as it was by the system test. In this paper we show that DUTs retain some of the advantages of unit tests, can be automatically generated, and have the potential for revealing faults related to intricate system executions. We present a framework for carving and replaying DUTs that accounts for a wide variety of strategies and tradeoffs, we implement an automated instance of the framework with several techniques to mitigate test cost and enhance flexibility and robustness, and we empirically assess the efficacy of carving and replaying DUTs on three software artifacts. © 2009 IEEE.","Elbaum S., Chin H.N., Dwyer M.B., Jorde M.",2009,Scopus,10.1109/TSE.2008.103,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-60449098360&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2008.103&partnerID=40&md5=9adf569a59371ea7ed8b1ed519a932e8
"[Relationship between Chinese medicine pattern with blood levels of sex hormone, lipid and glucose in climacteric women patients with hypertension].","To find the objective indices for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pattern identification in women patients with climacteric hypertension (CH) by exploring the relationship between TCM pattern with blood levels of sex hormone, lipid and glucose. TCM syndrome differentiation was made in 75 women CH patients, 43 as yin-deficiency with inner dryness pattern (YDD) and 32 as non-YDD, and correlation analyses were conducted on TCM patterns and blood levels of estradiol (E2), lipids and glucose. Besides the level of E2 in YDD was lower than that in non-YDD [(112.26 -/+ 66.81) pmol/L vs (146.69 +/- 83.59) pmol/L, P < 0.05), no difference between the two patterns was found in the other indices measured (P > 0.05). Further subunit analysis showed that in patients with CH grade 1, blood levels of total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) were higher in the 13 patients of YDD than those in the 9 of non-TDD (P < 0.05); in patients with CH grade 2, levels of E2, progesterone (T), HDL and ApoA-I were lower but level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) was higher in the 20 YDD than those in the 10 non-YDD (all P < 0.05); while in patients with CH grade, no statistically significant difference was shown between 3 patients of 10 with YDD and 13 with non-YDD in all the indices measured (P > 0.05). Blood level of E2 shows different characteristics between CH patients of YDD and non-YDD patterns, suggesting that it may provide some help to syndrome micro-differentiation, and taking it as an objective index for syndrome typing of climacteric hypertension in female is considerable.","Lin X., Yu C.Y., Lei Z.Y.",2009,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864292609&partnerID=40&md5=d1ccfce1b7152316b579edf0b13ab777
Teaching software quality assurance by encouraging student contributions to an open source web-based system for the assessment of programming assignments,"This paper presents a novel and innovative pedagogical approach for teaching software quality assurance in the undergraduate computer science curriculum. The approach is based on students contributing programming problems to an open source web-based system that is used for student practice and instructor assessment of assignments. WeBWorK, and some of the latest web-based systems, use a mechanism based on unit testing to account for variation in the way in which the same problem can be answered in an accurate manner, making such systems highly appealing for education. Tackling open-ended programming problems within WeBWorK therefore requires students to write a code fragment that is then checked for semantic correctness. Given that WeBWorK is open source, the teaching approach that we have evolved revolves around students creating their own problems for other students to practice with. This requires students to construct comprehensive unit tests that can assure botii the usability and accuracy of their work prior to deployment. The paper describes this approach, gives examples of student work, presents findings from the experience of using the approach in the classroom, and discusses broader lessons and reasons for integrating software quality assurance practices into the computer science curriculum.

Pitfalls in teaching development and testing of concurrent programs and how to overcome them,"This lecture captures industrial and academic experience in teaching concurrent programming for several years. While the statement of a concurrent protocol is typically small taking only a few pages to complete, the statement implicitly introduces an exponential or possibly infinite space of possible interleavings. The novice is not aware of this, and as a result sometimes does not understand the lecture. To overcome this pitfall, exploration of the protocol interleaving is practiced from day one. A classical example being how many results does 100 threads executing i++ have? Separation of concerns is used to minimize the interleaving space at design time. Specifically, abstract primitives, such as atomic block and a conditional atomic block are introduced as a design tool. They are typically not to be found in practical programming languages. This reduces the space of interleavings to be considered at design time and facilitate verification and review of the protocol. On the other hand, the approach introduces pitfalls encountered in the translation/implementation stage. Once the abstract design is verified and/or tested, it needs to be translated to a commercial language where the synchronization primitives, for performance reasons, are weaker. For example, an atomic block is implemented using a lock unlock pair. But now atomicity needs to be ensured by the protocol implementer - a typical pitfall being the confusion of a lock/unlock code segment with an atomic block. Locations in the code that access the protected shared resources should be identified and access needs to follow the lock/unlock protocol. Exceptions and signals needs to be handled appropriately and adhere to the lock/unlock protocol. To avoid translation pitfalls, bug patterns are taught and precise understanding of the synchronization primitives is emphasized. Testing of the implemented protocol is taught. Testing should be aggressive, at unit test, and attempt to cover the interleaving space instead of common practice of testing concurrency at system test in a round about way through stress. Tools like ConTest or CHESS can be applied to this end.

UK domestic air conditioning: A study of occupant use and energy efficiency,"This paper presents the results of a study of air-conditioning usage in homes in the southeast of England. First part of the study consisted surveying 13 dwellings with air-conditioning for a series of 4 week periods during the summer of 2004. The second part involved testing energy efficiency of ""single-split"" and ""portable"" air-conditioning units under ""in-use"" conditions. Data on usage patterns and typical temperature profiles during operation was collected and is presented here. Temperatures at which users switched their units on were, on average, 24-25oC, while typical running times for a single operation were found to be around 5 hours during daytime and 7 hours at night in bedrooms. The study also indicated high occupant satisfaction rates with split-units. An unexpectedly high overall energy efficiency ratio (EER), of 5-10, was found for the single-split unit tested during the relatively mild autumn weather. However, a very poor EER, of less than 1, was found for the portable unit tested. Further work is needed to increase the reliability and statistical significance of the results.","Pathan A., Young A., Oreszczyn T.",2008,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860727631&partnerID=40&md5=314ebb036e8330a3709cf4671d1dad30
Field slope effects on uniformity of corn seed spacing for three precision planter metering systems,"The effects of field slope on planter seed spacing uniformity were evaluated for three different seed metering units (cell plate, finger pick-up, and flat plate) operating with medium round corn seed in a laboratory using the University of Nebraska planter test stand with an opto-electronic seed spacing sensor system. The metering units included a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the standard cell corn plate, a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus VacuMeter row unit with the flat plate, and a John Deere MaxEmerge™ Plus row unit with the finger pick-up metering system. Planter seed spacing uniformity was measured using three parameters: ISO Miss index, ISO Multiples index, and Coefficient of Precision (CP3). Six replications for nine field slope treatments were conducted for each metering unit. The field slope treatments included: front-up (front of planter unit), front-down, right-up (right side of planter unit), and left-up (left side of the planter unit) each at field slope levels of 10% and 20%, and level. Slope and travel pattern had significant effects on the seed spacing uniformity for each of the three metering units tested. The finger pick-up was the least affected by slope as only the treatment of front-up at 20% slope had significantly worse seed spacing uniformity than the level treatment. For the cell plate metering unit, seed spacing uniformity was best with the planter on a level surface, or with the uphill-downhill travel pattern on a 10% slope, and on a 20% slope the uphill-downhill travel pattern had better seed spacing uniformity than the on-the-contour travel pattern. The finger pick-up metering unit had equally good seed spacing uniformity on a level surface and with either travel pattern on the 10% slope. On a 20% slope, the finger pick-up metering unit had better seed spacing uniformity with the on-the-contour travel pattern than with the uphill-downhill travel pattern. The flat plate metering unit had its best seed spacing uniformity with the front up on a 10% slope, followed by equivalent seed spacing uniformity between right up on a 10% slope and on a level surface. The flat plate metering unit had equivalent seed spacing uniformity between the travel patterns on a 10% slope, while on a 20% slope the uphill-downhill travel pattern had better seed spacing uniformity than the on-the-contour travel pattern. © 2008 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Searle C.L., Kocher M.F., Smith J.A., Blankenship E.E.",2008,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58049211626&partnerID=40&md5=0cb286b7c8b208721dd2da9d608064c1
Exploring the composition of unit test suites,"In agile software development, test code can considerably contribute to the overall source code size. Being a valuable asset both in terms of verification and documentation, the composition of a test suite needs to be well understood in order to identify opportunities as well as weaknesses for further evolution. In this paper, we argue that the visualization of structural characteristics is a viable means to support the exploration of test suites. Thanks to general agreement on a limited set of key test design principles, such visualizations are relatively easy to interpret. In particular, we present visualizations that support testers in (i) locating test cases; (ii) examining the relation between test code and production code; and (iii) studying the composition of and dependencies within test cases. By means of two case studies, we demonstrate how visual patterns help to identify key test suite characteristics.","Van Rompaey B., Demeyer S.",2008,Scopus,10.1109/ASEW.2008.4686316,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-58049158391&doi=10.1109%2fASEW.2008.4686316&partnerID=40&md5=cbcb36df6d04c8abf2391aa91705c6dd

A reference point is provided by hand generated test vectors constructed during development to establish minimum acceptance criteria. The study shows that 2-way testing is not adequate measured by mutants kill rate compared with hand generated test set of similar size, but that higher factor t-way test sets can perform at least as well. To reduce the computation overhead of testing large numbers of vectors over large numbers of mutants a staged optimising approach to applying t-way tests is proposed and evaluated which shows improvements in execution time and final test set size. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ellims M., Ince D., Petre M.",2008,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-540-87698-4_5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-56549103447&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-540-87698-4_5&partnerID=40&md5=3c24d58f91d38fba14b2a5be59e2cf08
Increasing test granularity by aggregating unit tests,"Unit tests are focused, efficient, and there are many techniques to support their automatic generation. Coarser granularity tests, however, are necessary to validate the behavior of larger software components, and are also likely to be more robust in the presence of program changes. This paper investigates whether coarser granularity tests can be automatically generated by aggregating unit tests. We leverage our Differential Unit Test (DUT) framework to represent unit tests, define a space of potential aggregations of those unit tests, and implement a strategy to traverse that space to generate Aggregated DUTs (A-DUTs) that validate the effects of multiple method calls on a (set of) receiver object(s).

Unit testing web services,"Some of the techniques and patterns for unit testing Web Service (WS) applications to enable TDD as well as general-purpose testing is presented. WS messages may contain complex objects serialized as XML, or simple HTTP GET/POST operations. Generation and communication of WS messages represents a significant potential point of failure , and screams for test coverage. It is important to test SOA applications by making the tests interact with a live instance of the service. The Pseudocode in Listing One is from the test class MyServiceTest, showing the way test method testGetDoc() connects to the service. The pattern when developing web services using TDD is to first create a test for each new service behavior, then implement the service interface functionality that enables the test to pass. Service tests can validate behaviors that are difficult to test manually. The test method testMultipleConnections() validates that different clients have different service-side state by creating two client connections to the service.",Hamill P.,2008,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-55149085014&partnerID=40&md5=e1f955869d4e72261c2171e668f1abca

An efficient dynamic channel assignment with channel locked for TDD-CDMA systems,"Time division duplex (TDD) is an efficient approach to combat the traffic asymmetry issues via adapting the resource (Time slots) for uplink and downlink in TDD-CDMA systems. However, the cross-slot interference is caused by the asymmetry traffic between mobile subscribers and base stations, which can seriously degrade the system performance. In this paper, an efficient dynamic channel assignment with channel locked (DCA/CL) is investigated for TDD-CDMA communication systems. The cell is divided into three sections by directional antennas. The above tri-sector cell architecture possesses additional orthogonality inherently due to the directivity of directional antenna, which can provide an additional degree of freedom in allocating radio resource with the channel locked directly in the section of the neighbor cell. Further, the proposed scheme is combined with transmission power control to decrease the interference, and is also evaluated by computer simulation. The results show it efficiently reduces the failure probability and achieves better system performance. ©2008 IEEE.",Zheng Z.,2008,Scopus,10.1109/ICCSC.2008.81,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-50649102139&doi=10.1109%2fICCSC.2008.81&partnerID=40&md5=2a616157f56263941661237e721731b6
Framework testing of web applications using TTCN-3,"Functional testing of web applications has become increasingly complex. Browser-based interfaces incorporate rich, client-side scripting that is increasingly independent of server-side application logic. At the same time, the server side application logic interacts with reusable components for key elements (security, shopping cart, product catalog, order processing) within the framework of a component-based architecture, using beans and web services. In this paper, we illustrate how a test specification approach using a language like TTCN-3 can be used to define test cases at different levels of abstraction that are more robust in the face of volatile presentation and implementation details. A case study of a shopping cart scenario with order processing is used as an illustration. Features of TTCN-3 are demonstrated, including a powerful matching mechanism that allows a separation between behavior and the conditions governing behavior. As well, TTCN-3's data types and set-based operations allow one to track and verify the information management done by a web application, independent of implementation details. These features allow a tester to take a systematic approach to testing web applications but requires more sophistication and skills.

A platform-based software design methodology for embedded control systems: An Agile toolkit,"A discrete control system, with stringent hardware constraints, is effectively an embedded real-time system and hence requires a rigorous methodology to develop the software involved. The development methodology proposed in this paper adapts agile principles and patterns to support the building of embedded control systems, focusing on the issues relating to a system's constraints and safety. Strong unit testing, to ensure correctness, including the satisfaction of timing constraints, is the foundation of the proposed methodology. A platform-based design approach is used to balance costs and time-to-market in relation to performance and functionality constraints. It is concluded that the proposed methodology significantly reduces design time and costs, as well as leading to better software modularity and reliability. © 2008 IEEE.","Cordeiro L., Mar C., Valentin E., Cruz F., Patrick D., Barreto R., Lucena V.",2008,Scopus,10.1109/ECBS.2008.19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-44149119116&doi=10.1109%2fECBS.2008.19&partnerID=40&md5=12d8b0a18ee2d7330ab565c61f03bc86

UTRA-TDD opportunity-driven multiple access (ODMA),"In this and the following two chapters the focus moves away from networks which are controlled centrally by a base station to a hybrid cellular network which permits cellular operation as well as peer-to-peer operation. Essentially we consider multi-hop wireless networks based on opportunity-driven multiple access (ODMA) which will be shown to reduce the overall transmission power in a system, to be resilient to shadowing and to potentially increase the coverage compared with single-hop transmission. However, for simple receivers and low user density, the actual capacity of UTRA-TDD may be marginally reduced from the maximum non-relaying capacity. This chapter begins the study of ODMA based systems by analysing the implications of relaying in a cellular scenario compared to a conventional nonrelaying system. Initially the interference is analysed by investigating the effect of reduced transmitted power resulting from reduced path loss for a link. The effect of shadowing is considered and it is shown that a relaying system is able to benefit from increased zero mean lognormal shadowing by utilising the diversity of paths available. A correlated shadowing model is developed from a previous model considering both distance and angle of arrival (Klingenbrunn and Mogensen, 1999) to include the shadowing correlation between all transceivers, as they may all be available to receive in a relaying environment. It is shown that while this affects the interference pattern the perturbation is not significant. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.","Rouse T., McLaughlin S.",2008,Scopus,10.1017/CBO9780511550904.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928278562&doi=10.1017%2fCBO9780511550904.006&partnerID=40&md5=d3a6068b2648937c8852b0cda13ed2fb
Contract-driven development,"In spite of cultural difference between the corresponding scientific communities, recognition is growing that test-based and specification-based approaches to software development actually complement each other. The revival of interest in testing tools and techniques follows in particular from the popularity of ""Test-Driven Development""; rigorous specification and proofs have, for their part, also made considerable progress. There remains, however, a fundamental superiority of specifications over test: you can derive tests from a specification, but not the other way around. Contract-Driven Development is a new approach to systematic software construction combining ideas from Design by Contract, from TestDriven Development, from work on formal methods, and from advances in automatic testing as illustrated for example in our AutoTest tool. Like TDD it gives tests a central role in the development process, but these tests are deduced from possibly partial specifications (contracts) and directly supported by the development environment.

Patterns for scripted acceptance test-driven development,"This paper introduces a series of related patterns to be used in an acceptance testdriven development (ATDD) approach to software development using scripts. ATDD uses executable client-readable acceptance tests written in the form of scripts as the key analysis artifacts that guide software development and presents a number of advantages over traditional analysis artifacts - texts and diagrams. They include a better bridging of communication gaps between clients and developers, prevention of feature creep and synchronization between analysis changes and the code being written. There are some challenges involved with the application of ATDD so that it yields most of the benefits it offers. With this set of patterns we want to summarize some of the insights others and we have had with the approach that help cope with the challenges it imposes.","Neto O.A., Sauvé J., Dantas A.",2007,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84871481303&partnerID=40&md5=398092321457e227a3a08578eb3740af
Medium access control and routing protocols for wireless mesh networks,"Wireless mesh networks (WMNs), a.k.a. community wireless networks, have emerged to be a new cost-effective and performance-adaptive network paradigm for the nextgeneration wireless Internet. Targeting primarily for solving the well-known last mile problem for broadband access [1, 2], WMNs aim to offer high-speed coverage at a significantly lower deployment and maintenance cost. As shown in Fig. 4.1, most of the nodes are stationary in WMNs. Only a fraction of nodes have direct access, and will serve as gateways, to the Internet. In addition, several nodes serve as relays forwarding traffic from other nodes (as well as their own traffic) and maintain network-wide Internet connectivity, while the remaining nodes send frames along dynamically selected ad-hoc paths to the gateway nodes with Internet access. WMNs are preferable to existing cable/DSL based networks or wireless LANs (that provide WiFi access), due to the following advantages: (i) mesh networks are more cost-effective as service providers do not have to install a wired connection to each subscriber (20-50K per square mile to establish access, approximately 1/4 of the cost incurred in high speed cable access); (ii) mesh networks are inherently more reliable since each node has redundant paths to reach the Internet; (iii) the throughput attained by a mesh network user can be, in principle, increased through routing via multiple, bandwidth-abundant paths (in contrast, in WLANs the shared bandwidth decreases as the number of users within a HotSpot increases); and (iv) WMNs can readily extend their coverage by installing additional ad-hoc hops. Several cities are planning or have partially deployed WMNs, such as Bay Area Wireless Users Group (BAWUG) [3], Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network (CUWiN) [4], SFLan [5], SeattleWireless [6], Southampton OpenWireless Network (SOWN) [7], and Wireless Leiden (in Netherlands) [8]. The academic/research efforts are, on the other hand, represented by the MIT Roofnet project [9], the Rice University Technology for All project [10], and the MSR Self-organizing neighborhood wireless mesh networks project [1]. Although initial successes have been reported in these efforts, a number of performance related problems have also been identified. Excessive packet losses [11-13], unpredictable channel behaviors [11,12], inability to find stable and high-throughput paths [11, 12], and throughput degradation due to intra-flow and inter-flow interference [13-15] are among those most cited. All these problems are rooted in the fact that the notion of a link is no longer well-defined in wireless environments. In network theory and practice, a link is usually characterized by its bandwidth, latency, packet loss ratio and patterns. However, in a WMN, a wireless medium is shared among nodes, and the sharing range is determined by (i) several PHY/MAC attributes such as the transmit power, the carrier sense threshold, and the channel on which an interface sends/receives frames, (ii) intra- and inter-flow interference (which in turn is contingent upon how nodes and traffic are distributed in the spatial and temporal domains), and (iii) environmental factors, such as multi-path fading and shadowing effects, temperature and humidity variation, and existence of objects in between. As a result, all the definitive metrics that characterize a link are no longer well-defined for a wireless link. All the protocols that were devised, and well-suited, for wireline networks will likely yield poor performance or even fail in WMNs. For example, as shown in [11] and [16], the shortest path algorithm with the hop count as the link metric will likely identify paths that are composed of long, lossy links with low bandwidth. To solve (or at least mitigate) the above problems, one should (a) characterize how, and to what extent, wireless links are affected by PHY/MAC attributes and other environmental factors, (b) identify control knobs in the PHY/MAC layers with which the sharing range of a wireless link can be better controlled, and (c) understand the implication of making available these PHY/MAC attributes to higher-layer protocols on system performance optimization. Central to issues (a) and (b) is medium access control (MAC), while issue (c) is usually termed as cross layer design and optimization. In this chapter, we discuss the state of the art in designing and implementing MAC for WMNs in Section 4.2. In particular, we categorize existingMAC-related research into four categories: (1) controlling the sharing range of the wireless medium and increasing spatial reuse; (2) exploiting temporal/spatial diversity; (3) exploiting availability of multiple channels; and (4) exercising rate control. We also introduce in Section 4.3 a modular programming environment, termed as the Transport Device Driver (TDD), that exports the PHY/MAC attributes via well-defined APIs and facilitates cross layer design and optimization, as a case study of cross layer design and optimization. We then present various routing protocols that take advantage of PHY/MAC attributes (such as channels) for route optimization in Section 4.4. We discuss open research issues in Section 4.5.

A systematic approach to automatically generate test scenarios from uml activity diagrams,"Test scenarios are frequently used in scenario-based software testing. However, generation of the test scenarios is usually a manual and labor-intensive task. It is often desired that test scenarios can be automatically generated. As a semi-formal modeling language, UML is widely used in both academia research and industry practice to describe analysis and design specifications. The UML activity diagrams (ADs) are mainly used in business logic processing at the early stage of software development life-cycle. Obviously, testing scenarios generated from ADs can contribute to test driven development. Nevertheless, it is difficult to automatically generate test scenarios from ADs which contains fork-join pairs mixed with loops and branches. In this paper, a systematic approach is proposed to automatically generate test scenarios from the UML activity diagrams which may contain complicated fork-join structure.","Xu D., Li H., Lam C.P.",2007,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-56149118523&partnerID=40&md5=54fbdbee16bf040ada3cd33f0e4568da
Improving evolutionary testing in the presence of function-assigned flags,"Evolutionary structural testing, an approach to automatically generating relevant unit test cases, encounters difficulties when the tested software contains boolean variables. This issue, known as the flag problem, has been studied by many researchers. However, previous work does not address the issue of function-assigned flags which constitutes a special type of the flag problem that often occurs in the context of object-orientation. This paper elaborates on a new approach to the flag problem that can also handle function-assigned flags while being applicable to the conventional flag problem, as well. It relies on a code transformation that leads to an improved fitness landscape which provides better guidance to the evolutionary search. We present four case studies including a fitness landscape analysis and empirical results. The results show that the suggested code transformation improves evolutionary structural testing in the presence of function-assigned flags. © 2007 IEEE.","Wappler S., Baresel A., Wegener J.",2007,Scopus,10.1109/TAICPART.2007.4344095,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-48049101928&doi=10.1109%2fTAICPART.2007.4344095&partnerID=40&md5=e90a135916f00ec784156864bd2c0809
Automated testing and response analysis of web services,"Web services are a popular way of implementing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), which has gained rapid adoption and support from leading companies in industry. Testing can be used to help assure both the correctness and robustness of a web service. Because manual testing is tedious, tools are needed to automate test generation and execution for web services. This paper presents a framework and its supporting tool for automatically generating and executing web-service requests and analyzing the subsequent request-response pairs. Given a service provider's Web Service Description Language (WSDL) specification, we first automatically generate necessary Java code to implement a client (service requestor). We then leverage automated unit test generation tools for Java to generate unit tests (including extreme, special, and random input values), and execute the generated unit tests, which in turn invoke the service under test. Finally we analyze the large number of request-response pairs from the web service invocation and identify robustness problems. We have applied our framework to freely available web services and our experiences show that we can quickly generate and execute web-service requests that may reveal robustness problems with no knowledge of the underlying web service implementation. © 2007 IEEE.","Martin E., Basu S., Xie T.",2007,Scopus,10.1109/ICWS.2007.49,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-46849084352&doi=10.1109%2fICWS.2007.49&partnerID=40&md5=6c4a2d45b3a8fd1072ab9d8e61c57892
Managing large scale network model for energy management systems & business management systems,"Background: Prior to the start up of the Standard Market Design (SMD-2), the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) used various tools to maintain and update three network models used to support the Energy Management System (EMS) and Business Management Systems (BMS) applications. The process of maintaining and updating the network models for EMS & BMS applications became more challenged and cumbersome for our engineers to support. These challenges are becoming more relevant as the NYISO grids are becoming more congested with rapidly changing power flow patterns responding to market conditions. The NYISO's network models cover the entire New York state with about 3100 buses, 30/70 split between internal/external and 40 AGC tie lines to other ISOs such as PJM, ISONE, IMO & HQ and all the 69KV and above systems. Currently, there are eight Transmission Owners and 400 plus Market Participants that participate in our markets. As part of the SMD-2's requirements, which were successfully implemented in December 2005, the NYISO consolidated all the SCADA, EMS & BMS applications to run under one single platform and that is ABB's Ranger Systems. To maximize the convergence and improve the solutions between the SCADA, EMS and BMS applications, network models for various applications on different platforms were also consolidated into a single model and that in turn drives all the applications including the Dispatcher Training Simulator. CIM Data Engineering Toolkit: ABB's Ranger System that utilized the CIM DE Toolkit, an Oracle based program, was selected and used to maintain and update the network model. The CIM Toolkit features a graphical editing environment to manage data in a CIM-based format, including automatic diagram generation, and multi-user, versioned editing. The CIM DE Toolkit includes tools for the import and export of CPSM-compliant full and incremental CIM/XML data as well as the comparison of existing models to CIM/XML data. The CIM database contains not only the network model data such as breakers, generators, lines, transformers, shunts, SVCs, Statcom, loads and others but also contains the SCADA data as well as Seasonal and Dynamic equipment ratings. The CIM database also contains PI data definition, and other data that are required to drive the Control Center Map board. In addition to standard data requirements for EMS applications, there are a few special data that are required for BMS applications such as Equipment Outage Priority, Load Pocket Definition, Facility Monitored and Secured flags and others. Network Model Update: The network model update is being initiated by the Market Participants, Transmission Owners, and internally. Various processes were implemented to ensure that appropriate upgrade and newly added equipments and associated measurements were notified in a timely manner by the Transmission Owners so that they can be reflected in the CIM database for all applications. Currently, network data updates are being reported to the NYISO through the one-line station diagrams, and text files, since most of the TOs do not have the tools to generate either full or incremental CIM-XML files from their EMS systems. The External Control Area network updates are being requested on a needed basis. The NYISO has been providing the full net work model in the standard CIM-XML file to other neighboring ISOs and Transmission Owners. Currently, the CIM-XML Extension, which was created directly from the DE Toolkit, is being used to generate the Ranger Run-Time for BMS applications on a monthly basis. Data Exchanged between EMS. BMS and others applications: In addition to the Load Forecast and generator bid data, which was provided from other applications based on different platforms, BMS applications also acquire other data directly from the EMS system such as Contingency Definition, Contingency Group, Security Monitor Flags, Branch Group flags, Incremental Limit Change Table flags, EMS load patterns, EMS external generator schedules, Equipment Outage Priority, Regulation and reserve requirement. The data is being exchanged between SCADA, EMS and BMS applications in real time and on exception. The key that allows all data being exchanged among applications is the PTID number, a unique ID that was assigned to each piece of the network equipments and other Control Area related definitions. Network Model Validation: Unlike other ISO's where different groups within the organization handle the physical and financial models, the NYISO designates just one department to handle all the network modeling and validation processes. All the network model data unit validation is being performed on the development servers, where the live-data is fed directly from the Production System. Benchmark tests can be performed in parallel against the Production Systems. The following applications are be validated once the new run-time database is created: SCADA system, EMS - State Estimator, Contingency Analysis, Dispatcher Load Flow, Security Monitor, AGC and BMS - Real Time Commitment, Real-Time Dispatch, and Security Constrained Unit Commitment (Day Ahead Evaluation software). Once the unit tests are completed, then the final model is further validated in the QA department for System Integration bid-to-bill testing. The network model is being updated to the Production System on a one to two month basis. ©2007 IEEE.",Tran D.,2007,Scopus,10.1109/PES.2007.385959,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42649142266&doi=10.1109%2fPES.2007.385959&partnerID=40&md5=acb5b2db3076a1c011ea111de0d2356b
Dynamic phasor measurement unit test system,"This paper presents the plans and progress towards the development of a dynamic phasor measurement unit (PMU) performance test system at NIST. We describe an algorithm for taking time-synchronized samples of single-phase voltage and current power signals and calculating their dynamic parameters, in particular the signal magnitude, phase, frequency, and rate of change of frequency that a PMU reports. PMUs must time stamp their values at periodic Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) markers called the update times. Thus, to provide a reference for PMU testing the sampled data can be fit to a model to define the value of a dynamic parameter at a specific time. The analysis model proposed in this paper assumes that the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters of the signals are constant over the sampling interval analyzed. This analysis interval is usually the same as the update period or an integer multiple of that period. In the proposed analysis model the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters are considered a polynomial in time about the update times. The order of the polynomial can be adjusted in a way that meets the needs of the signal being analyzed, yet minimizes the computational effort and sensitivity to noise. We show that when the dynamic variations are analyzed in this way, a single matrix can be used to iteratively converge on a good estimate of the dynamic frequency and magnitude parameters. The polynomial model can be used to generate and analyze test signals. Several test patterns are proposed, which include linearly changing magnitudes or frequencies. As expected, during low voltage tests of the system, the analysis does very well when the generation model matches the analysis model. Several other generation models are also proposed, such as sine waves or damped sine waves. The proposed analysis model is shown to be very accurate in these cases as well. © 2007 IEEE.","Stenbakken G., Zhou M.",2007,Scopus,10.1109/PES.2007.386139,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-42549137266&doi=10.1109%2fPES.2007.386139&partnerID=40&md5=b4bc631faf5ee14033e8aa0d7d9c02fd

Study and implementation of a software development pattern for online transient security early warning and protecting system,"To make the online transient early warning and security protecting system easy to reuse and maintain, a software development pattern is proposed. Several advanced methods, such as architecture analysis, design pattern, framework and unit testing, are used in this pattern to enhance the development efficiency and software quality. A layered architecture is introduced during the design process and a 'strategy pattern' is used to adapt to the changing requirement for the dynamic model of the component concerned. An open framework for distributed task dispatching is also presented. A 'subscriber/publisher' pattern is used to implement message exchange between the server and clients, which is adaptive to the hardware configuration changes.

Field investigations on the survival of Escherichia coli and presence of other enteric micro-organisms in biosolids-amended agricultural soil,"Aims: To measure the survival of enteric micro-organisms in agricultural soil amended with conventional and enhanced treated biosolids in relation to environmental and edaphic conditions. Methods and Results: Escherichia coli, Salmonella and F-specific RNA bacteriophage were enumerated in sludge and amended soil. Salmonella was not detected and only small numbers of bacteriophages were found in conventional, dewatered mesophilic anaerobically digested biosolids (DMAD). Neither organism was detected in soil. Escherichia coli numbers in soil increased with DMAD application compared with the unamended control, or soil receiving enhanced treated, thermally dried digested (TDD) and composted (CPT) biosolids. Empirical statistical models were developed summarizing the relationship between soil temperature, moisture content and time and E. coli populations. Background numbers of E. coli declined with increasing soil temperature and decreasing soil moisture responding to seasonal patterns in environmental conditions. Time following application was the only significant explanatory variable of E. coli numbers and decay in DMAD-amended soil. Conclusions: E. coli are an indigenous component of the microbial community in field soil and populations increased in cool, moist soil during autumn-winter and declined in warm, dryer soil during spring-summer. Enhanced treated biosolids were not a source of E. coli, but reduced the size of the indigenous population possibly by stimulating the activity of predatory and competing soil flora because of the organic substrate input from sludge. Conventionally treated biosolids increased E. coli numbers in soil. However, introduced bacteria declined rapidly and survival was limited to 3 months, irrespective of the timing of sludge application or environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results provide assurance that residual numbers of pathogens applied to soil in treated biosolids decay to background values well within cropping and harvesting restrictions imposed when sewage sludge is spread on farmland. © 2007 The Authors.","Lang N.L., Bellett-Travers M.D., Smith S.R.",2007,Scopus,10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03489.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35448949627&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2672.2007.03489.x&partnerID=40&md5=98c690dfeb1042e2effafbe1d2695b12

A new approach for GenCos profit based unit commitment in day-ahead competitive electricity markets considering reserve uncertainty,"This paper presents a new approach for GenCos Profit Based Unit Commitment (GPBUC) in day-ahead competitive electricity markets.

The estimated probability that spinning and non-spinning reserves are called and generated is also considered in the formulation to simulate the reserve uncertainty. The artificial neural network (ANN) is applied for forecasting the reserve probability considering line limits, line and generator outages, market prices, bidding strategy, load and reserves patterns. Fuel and emission constraints are included in the model. A hybrid method between Lagrangian relaxation (LR) and evolutionary programming (EP) is applied to solve the proposed GPBUC problem.

Testing the testing effect in the classroom,"Laboratory studies show that taking a test on studied material promotes subsequent learning and retention of that material on a final test (termed the testing effect). Educational research has virtually ignored testing as a technique to improve classroom learning. We investigated the testing effect in a college course. Students took weekly quizzes followed by multiple choice criterial tests (unit tests and a cumulative final). Weekly quizzes included multiple choice or short answer questions, after which feedback was provided. As an exposure control, in some weeks students were presented target material for additional reading. Quizzing, but not additional reading, improved performance on the criterial tests relative to material not targeted by quizzes. Further, short answer quizzes produced more robust benefits than multiple choice quizzes. This pattern converges with laboratory findings showing that recall tests are more beneficial than recognition tests for subsequent memory performance. We conclude that in the classroom testing can be used to promote learning, not just to evaluate learning. © 2007 Psychology Press.","McDaniel M.A., Anderson J.L., Derbish M.H., Morrisette N.",2007,Scopus,10.1080/09541440701326154,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34347371979&doi=10.1080%2f09541440701326154&partnerID=40&md5=dd902332698de698e9ddacbf311f9525

Software Development Rhythms: Harmonizing Agile Practices for Synergy,"An accessible, innovative perspective on using the flexibility of agile practices to increase software quality and profitability. When agile approaches in your organization don't work as expected or you feel caught in the choice between agility and discipline, it is time to stop and think about software development rhythms! Agile software development is a popular development process that continues to reshape philosophies on the connections between disciplined processes and agile practices. In Software Development Rhythms, authors Lui and Chan explain how adopting one practice and combining it with another builds upon the flexibility of agile practices to create a type of ""synergy"" defined as software development rhythms. The authors demonstrate how these rhythms can be harmonized to achieve synergies, making them stronger together than they would be apart. Software Development Rhythms provides programmers with a powerful metaphor for resolving some classic software management controversies and dealing with some common difficulties in agile software management. Software Development Rhythms is divided into two parts and covers: Essentials - provides an introduction to software development rhythms; explores the programmer's unconscious mind at work on software methodology; discusses the characteristics of the iterative cycle and open source software development; and introduces the topic of agile values and agile practices. Rhythms - compares plagiarism programming with cut-paste programming; provides an in-depth discussion of different ways to approach collaborative programming; demonstrates how to combine and harmonize these practices so they can be applied to common software management problems such as motivating programmers, discovering solution patterns, managing software teams, and rescuing troubled IT projects; and takes a comprehensive look at Scrum, CMMI, Just-In-Time, Lean Software Development, and Test-Driven Development from a software development rhythm perspective. Abundantly illustrated with informative graphics and amusing cartoons, Software Development Rhythms is a comprehensive and thought-provoking introduction to some of the most advanced concepts in current software management. Written in a refreshingly easy-to-read style and filled with interesting anecdotes, simulation exercises, and case studies, Software Development Rhythms is suitable for the practitioner and graduate student alike. It offers readers practical guidance on how to take the themes and concepts presented in this book back to their own projects to harmonize their software practices and release the synergies of their own teams. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Lui K.M., Chan K.C.C.",2007,Scopus,10.1002/9780470192672,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889485034&doi=10.1002%2f9780470192672&partnerID=40&md5=bb4da5a4afcafd7698e27d08fccfc861
Multiple regression on distance matrices: A multivariate spatial analysis tool,"I explore the use of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), an extension of partial Mantel analysis, in spatial analysis of ecological data. MRM involves a multiple regression of a response matrix on any number of explanatory matrices, where each matrix contains distances or similarities (in terms of ecological, spatial, or other attributes) between all pair-wise combinations of n objects (sample units); tests of statistical significance are performed by permutation. The method is flexible in terms of the types of data that may be analyzed (counts, presence-absence, continuous, categorical) and the shapes of response curves. MRM offers several advantages over traditional partial Mantel analysis: (1) separating environmental distances into distinct distance matrices allows inferences to be made at the level of individual variables; (2) nonparametric or nonlinear multiple regression methods may be employed; and (3) spatial autocorrelation may be quantified and tested at different spatial scales using a series of lag matrices, each representing a geographic distance class. The MRM lag matrices model may be parameterized to yield very similar inferences regarding spatial autocorrelation as the Mantel correlogram. Unlike the correlogram, however, the lag matrices model may also include environmental distance matrices, so that spatial patterns in species abundance distances (community similarity) may be quantified while controlling for the environmental similarity between sites. Examples of spatial analyses with MRM are presented. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Lichstein J.W.,2007,Scopus,10.1007/s11258-006-9126-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846126538&doi=10.1007%2fs11258-006-9126-3&partnerID=40&md5=c641341879218205f86b6da3ad9ca3e5
Generating unit tests from formal proofs,We present a new automatic test generation method for JAVA CARD based on attempts at formal verification of the implementation under test (IUT). Self-contained unit tests in JUnit format are generated automatically. The advantages of the approach are: (i) it exploits the full information available in the IUT and in its formal model giving very good hybrid coverage; (ii) a non-trivial formal model of the IUT is unnecessary; (iii) it is adaptable to the skills that users may possess in formal methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.,"Engel C., Hähnle R.",2007,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-540-73770-4_10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-38049081121&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-540-73770-4_10&partnerID=40&md5=72919215cb6ff3b84a3d5b0485b354d5
Is the human masticatory system devoid of recurrent inhibition?,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the existence or otherwise of a functional recurrent inhibitory system (Renshaw cell system) in the motoneurons that innervate human masticatory muscles. In a previous study, l-acetylcarnitine (l-Ac), a substance known to potentiate recurrent inhibition in humans was found to alter, in a specific way, the discharge variability, and the synchronous activity of motor units depending on the presence or absence of recurrent inhibition in the corresponding motoneuron pool. Using a similar paradigm, we have recorded the tonic discharge activity of motor unit pairs from the masseter muscle during voluntary isometric contraction while subjects were undergoing continuous intravenous saline (SAL, NaCl 0.9%) perfusion. Following a brief baseline-recording period, the subjects were given a test injection of either l-Ac or isotonic saline (SAL) in a double blind manner. The variability, synchronization, and coherence between the motor unit discharges were analysed during three successive periods: pre-injection, during injection, and post-injection, each lasting 2-3 min. Neither l-Ac nor SAL injection induced a significant change in the inter-spike interval (ISI) or the coefficient of variation of the ISIs in the motor units tested. There were also no significant changes in the pattern of synchronous activity or in the coherence, which reflects the common frequency content of the unit discharges. Reminiscent of what had been observed previously with motoneurons without recurrent inhibition in the Abductor Digitorum Minimi muscle, the lack of effects of l-Ac injection on the firing behaviour of masseter motoneurons may suggest that classical Renshaw cell inhibition is lacking in this motoneuron pool. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Türker K.S., Schmied A., Rossi A., Mazzocchio R., Sowman P.F., Vedel J.P.",2007,Scopus,10.1007/s00221-006-0774-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34247480386&doi=10.1007%2fs00221-006-0774-2&partnerID=40&md5=0223b6d92254bbbd719c9b6c4c3f4498
WiFiRe: Rural area broadband access using the WiFi PHY and a multisector TDD MAC,"The needs of Indian rural telecom, and the economics of currently available broadband access technologies, motivate a new system for rural broadband access, which we call WiFiRe (WiFi Rural Extension). The system leverages the widely available, and highly cost-reduced, WiFi chipsets. We, however, retain only the PHY from these chipsets and propose a singlechannel, multisector, TDD MAC using directional antennas. The proposed WiFiRe MAC is similar to the WiMAX MAC in several respects.

Learning effective test driven development: Software development projects in an energy company,"The tests needed to prove, verify, and validate a software application are determined before the software application is developed. This is the essence of test driven development, an agile practice built upon sound software engineering principles. When applied effectively, this practice can have many benefits. The question becomes how to effectively adopt test driven development. This paper describes the experiences and lessons learned by two teams who adopted test driven development methodology for software systems developed at TransCanada. The overall success of test driven methodology is contingent upon the following key factors: experienced team champion, well-defined test scope, supportive database environment, repeatable software design pattern, and complementary manual testing. All of these factors and the appropriate test regime will lead to a better chance of success in a test driven development project.","Kum W., Law A.",2006,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77954017760&partnerID=40&md5=9374283648c662a35178855bd6b751c1
Strengthening method contracts for objects,"The main objective of a 'Design by Contracts' approach as applied to object-oriented systems, is to develop complete and consistent method contracts for the objects of the system. In this work, we propose a practical approach to develop these contracts for an object from its annotated structural representation, namely, UML constrained class diagram. We generate, simulate, and refine an object statechart from an initial set of method contracts which in turn help further validating and enhancing these contracts. The impact of this analysis can be multifold: first, it identifies various discrepancies like incomplete and inconsistent class specifications, second, a correct and consistent object statechart model is obtained from which reliable automated code and unit tests can easily be generated, third, facilitate essential and effective verification for software re-use, forth, the resulting statechart and class specifications are in a lock-steps which facilitates effective incremental development and change management and fifth, it allows a modeler to specify object's dynamic requirements declaratively on an abstract level, without the need to use full operational dynamic diagrams. We have also designed a tool ObjectSim that performs automated statechart generation and their interactive simulations. We demonstrate our approach using an example and discuss other related issues. © 2006 IEEE.","Gupta A., Raj A.",2006,Scopus,10.1109/APSEC.2006.54,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-46149101234&doi=10.1109%2fAPSEC.2006.54&partnerID=40&md5=e9c46cbf55506898638af8bcef0bd176

Software partitioning for effective automated unit testing,"A key problem for effective unit testing is the dificulty of partitioning large software systems into appropriate units that can be tested in isolation. We present an approach that identifies control and data inter-dependencies between software components using static program analysis, and divides the source code into units where highly-intertwined components are grouped together. Those units can then be tested in isolation using automated test generation techniques and tools, such as dynamic software model checkers. We discuss preliminary experimental results showing that automatic software partitioning can significantly increase test coverage without generating too many false alarms caused by unrealistic inputs being injected at interfaces between units.

Carving differential unit test cases from system test cases,"Unit test cases are focused and efficient. System tests are effective at exercising complex usage patterns. Differential unit tests (DUT) are a hybrid of unit and system tests. They are generated by carving the system components, while executing a system test case, that influence the behavior of the target unit, and then re-assembling those components so that the unit can be exercised as it was by the system test. We conjecture that DUTs retain some of the advantages of unit tests, can be automatically and inexpensively generated, and have the potential for revealing faults related to intricate system executions. In this paper we present a framework for automatically carving and replaying DUTs that accounts for a wide-variety of strategies, we implement an instance of the framework with several techniques to mitigate test cost and enhance flexibility, and we empirically assess the efficacy of carving and replaying DUTs.

"Source transformation, analysis and generation in TXL","The TXL transformation framework has been widely used in practical source transformation tasks in industry and academia for many years. At the core of the framework is the TXL language, a functional programming language specifically designed for expressing source transformation tasks. TXL programs are self-contained, specifying and implementing all aspects of parsing, pattern matching, transformation rules, application strategies and unparsing in a single uniform notation with no dependence on other tools or technologies. Programs are directly interpreted by the TXL processor without any compile or build step, making it particularly well suited to rapid turnaround, test-driven development. In this paper we provide a practical introduction to using TXL in rapidly developing source transformations from concrete examples, and review experience in applying TXL to a number of practical large scale applications in source code analysis, renovation and migration.

Test input generation for java containers using state matching,"The popularity of object-oriented programming has led to the wide use of container libraries. It is important for the reliability of these containers that they are tested adequately. We describe techniques for automated test input generation of Java container classes. Test inputs are sequences of method calls from the container interface. The techniques rely on state matching to avoid generation of redundant tests. Exhaustive techniques use model checking with explicit or symbolic execution to explore all the possible test sequences up to predefined input sizes. Lossy techniques rely on abstraction mappings to compute and store abstract versions of the concrete states; they explore underapproximations of all the possible test sequences. We have implemented the techniques on top of the Java PathFinder model checker and we evaluate them using four Java container classes. We compare state matching based techniques and random selection for generating test inputs, in terms of testing coverage. We consider basic block coverage and a form of predicate coverage - that measures whether all combinations of a predetermined set of predicates are covered at each basic block. The exhaustive techniques can easily obtain basic block coverage, but cannot obtain good predicate coverage before running out of memory. On the other hand, abstract matching turns out to be a powerful approach for generating test inputs to obtain high predicate coverage. Random selection performed well except on the examples that contained complex input spaces, where the lossy abstraction techniques performed better.

Effective channel assignment in multi-hop W-CDMA cellular networks,"Multi-hop relaying is an important concept in tackling the inherent problems of limited capacity and coverage in cellular networks. It helps to solve the dead-spots problem and to ease congestion in hotspots. However, to obtain good performance of multi-hop relaying, an effective channel assignment scheme is needed. In this paper, we study the design goals of a good channel assignment scheme. We then propose a channel assignment scheme, called Extended Delay-Sensitive Slot Assignment (E-DSSA), which achieves all these goals. The distinctive feature of E-DSSA is the use of a novel transmission zone testing technique which allows high flexibility and precision in channel assignment in TDD W-CDMA multi-hop cellular environment. Performance evaluation shows that E-DSSA outperforms its existing counterparts in terms of data throughput with low delay for both sparse and dense networks. E-DSSA is also shown to adapt to different cell sizes achieving high throughput and call acceptance ratios.

Testability analysis and scalable test generation for high-speed floating-point units,"High-speed datapaths in microprocessors and embedded processors contain complex floating-point (FP) arithmetic units which have a critical role in the processor's performance. Although the FP units' complex structure consists of classic integer arithmetic components, the embedded components encounter serious testability problems due to their limited accessibility from the FP unit ports and testability loss due to FP unit inherent operations, such as rounding and normalization. In this paper, we analyze the testability problems and present scalable test generation for FP units using as a demonstration vehicle the popular, high-speed, two-path architecture of the most complex unit, the FP adder. The key feature of the presented methodology is the identification of testability conditions that guarantee effective test pattern application and fault propagation for each of the components of the FP adder. The identified test conditions can be utilized with respect to any fault model and are independent of the internal structure and the size of the components. Thus, they can be applied to FP adders of various exponent and significand sizes (single, double, and custom precision), as well as to other types of FP units, which also consist of classic integer arithmetic components similarly interconnected. © 2006 IEEE.","Xenoulis G., Psarakis M., Gizopoulos D., Paschalis A.",2006,Scopus,10.1109/TC.2006.187,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33750101203&doi=10.1109%2fTC.2006.187&partnerID=40&md5=1998efeb0984d267b5c428ff17c64854
Is designing software different from designing other things?,"This paper explores the question of whether designing software is different from designing other things (we believe it is). We discuss several key distinctions that are largely missing from the discourse on software design yet which are vital to the success of software designs. These distinctions are increasingly important as software becomes prevalent in the design tools and products of other engineering disciplines. By considering what is similar and what is different we help reveal how the lessons of software design may help other disciplines, and vice versa. This in turn illuminates a core meta-question of how educators in academia and industry can help evolve our understanding of what we do so that we can be more effective at software design.

A road map for implementing eXtreme programming,"This paper proposes an implementation roadmap that shows how in-experienced software teams in industrial developing areas in China can adopt eXtreme Programming (XP) to produce software applications. Inexperienced teams unfamiliar with XP can face difficulties in adopting at once all twelve XP practices in a ""big bang"" implementation strategy. Intuitively, a step-by-step approach might seem more practical; however, XP practices are heavily intertwined and mutually dependent, creating problems in terms of prioritizing and justifying one instructional sequence over another. We propose a way to technically analyze the complex interrelationships between XP practices by identifying cluster patterns. These patterns can then be used to assist us in sequencing the introduction XP practices, helping both inexperienced teams and classroom learners in using XP.

Novel channel and polarization assignment schemes for 2-11 GHz fixed-broadband wireless access networks,"The scarcity of available spectrum in the 2-11 GHz frequency range and the continuously increasing number of users that require broadband communication services suggest that emerging fixed-broadband wireless access (F-BWA) networks will be deployed with aggressive frequency re-use to cope with capacity demands. In this context, co-channel interference may arise in high levels compromising the system's capacity and robust operation. Interference is further increased when limited directionality terminal antennas are employed to support non line-of-sight operation and in the case where an adaptive-time division duplex is selected for efficient radio resource management in asymmetric and time-varying traffic conditions. In this paper frequency channel assignment (CA) and antenna polarization assignment (PA) are considered as a means of mitigating interference. Two novel CA schemes that consider the distinct characteristics of F-BWA are proposed; the rotated-interleaved channel assignment and the non-uniform channel assignment. According to statistical interference simulation analysis the proposed schemes are more efficient in suppressing interference, achieving higher capacity compared to existing schemes while incurring no further complexity. In addition, instead of exploiting the performance of CA and PA schemes independently a framework for a joint CA-PA consideration is presented, where for a particular CA scheme an optimized PA pattern is developed. Results show that this approach improves the CA-PA interoperability increasing the overall performance. The efficiency of the proposed schemes is investigated for both FDD and adaptive-TDD schemes and is verified for various sectorization, frequency re-use and terminal antenna directivity configurations to ensure compatibility with different deployment scenarios. © Springer 2006.","Ntagkounakis K., Sharif B., Dallas P.",2006,Scopus,10.1007/s11277-005-9004-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33744786563&doi=10.1007%2fs11277-005-9004-7&partnerID=40&md5=09e127c30b6a45e46ad8acb6b72a3287

Auditory responses in the cochlear nucleus of awake mustached bats: Precursors to spectral integration in the auditory midbrain,"In the cochlear nucleus (CN) of awake mustached bats, single- and two-tone stimuli were used to examine how responses in major CN subdivisions contribute to spectrotemporal integrative features in the inferior colliculus (IC). Across CN subdivisions, the proportional representation of frequencies differed. A striking result was the substantial number of units tuned to frequencies <23 kHz. Across frequency bands, temporal response patterns, latency, and spontaneous discharge differed. For example, the 23- to 30-kHz representation, which comprises the fundamental of the sonar call, had an unusually high proportion of units with onset responses (39%) and low spontaneous rates (53%). Units tuned to 58-59 kHz, corresponding to the sharply tuned cochlear resonance, had slightly but significantly longer latencies than other bands. In units tuned to frequencies >30 kHz, 31% displayed a secondary excitatory peak, usually between 10 and 22 kHz. The secondary peak may originate in cochlear mechanisms for some units, but in others it may result from convergent input onto CN neurons. In 20% of units tested with two-tone stimuli, suppression of best frequency (BF) responses was tuned at least an octave below BF. These properties may underlie similar IC responses. However, other forms of spectral interaction present in IC were absent in CN: we found no facilitatory combination-sensitive interactions and very few combination-sensitive inhibitory interactions of the dominant IC type in which inhibition was tuned to 23-30 kHz. Such interactions arise above CN. Distinct forms of spectral integration thus originate at different levels of the ascending auditory pathway.

Managing a project course using extreme programming,"Shippensburg University offers an upper division project course in which the students use a variant of Extreme Programming (XP) including: the Planning Game, the Iteration Planning Game, test driven development, stand-up meetings and pair programming. We start the course with two weeks of controlled lab exercises designed to teach the students about test driven development in JUnit/Eclipse and designing for testability (with the humble dialog box design pattern) while practicing pair programming. The rest of our semester is spent in three four-week iterations developing a product for a customer. Our teams are generally large (14-16 students) so that the projects can be large enough to motivate the use of configuration management and defect tracking tools. The requirement of pair programming limits the amount of project work the students can do outside of class, so class time is spent on the projects and teaching is on-demand individual mentoring with lectures/labs inserted as necessary. One significant challenge in managing this course is tracking individual responsibilities and activities to ensure that all of the students are fully engaged in the project. To accomplish this, we have modified the story and task cards from XP to provide feedback to the students and track individual performance against goals as part of the students' grades. The resulting course has been well received by the students. This paper will describe this course in more detail and assess its effect on students' software engineering background through students' feedback and code metrics. © 2005 IEEE.",Wellington C.A.,2005,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33947248135&partnerID=40&md5=9b4cf16180d01238318ccc17ae482c37
A node architecture for disaster relief networking,"In this paper we present a node architecture for a personal node in a cognitive ad-hoc disaster relief network. This architecture is motivated from the network system requirements, especially single-hop distance and jamming-resilience requirements. It is shown that the power consumption of current-day Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) limits the channel bandwidth that can be used, both for a baseband processing system and the scanning system. We therefore propose to use a form of Frequency Hopping Time Division Multiplexing (FH/TDD) system, similar to Bluetooth. However, we propose to use OFDM as modulation scheme instead of GFSK and show that the OFDM symbol length for the frequency range at hand (400 -1000 M Hz) is consistent with a Bluetooth-alike FH/TDD scheme. We propose to modify the FH/TDD scheme to incorporate a radio-spectrum measurement phase. Based on these measurements carriers in the OFDM-based scheme are selected in such a fashion that legacy users are avoided. In case of too much legacy-user spectral usage hopping patterns may be altered. © 2005 IEEE.","Hoeksema F., Heskamp M., Schiphorst R., Slump K.",2005,Scopus,10.1109/DYSPAN.2005.1542673,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33749064905&doi=10.1109%2fDYSPAN.2005.1542673&partnerID=40&md5=59086fe79bcac0e4e8bc38ec54aa3087
Time-slot re-allocation for inter-frequency and inter-RAT handover in 1.28 Mcps TDD for UMTS,"This paper investigates the performance analysis and impact for the improved time-slot re-allocation scheme during the inter-frequency or inter-RAT handover from 1.28 Mcps TDD mode. Two proposed structures describe the use of asymmetric time-slot allocation pattern and the combination of different time-slot allocation pattern of traffic channel. Each proposed scheme can be applied to the measurement procedure for the possible handover scenarios to GSM and 1.28 Mcps TDD mode using different frequency band from original 1.28 Mcps TDD mode, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed structures attain the longer measurement time for target system to enhance the reliability of measurement or increase the probability of successful synchronization for handover. In summary, the improvement of handover performance can be achieved by adopting proposed schemes, but the impacts to other system functions should be further considered to implement in a real environment.","Kim J.G., Wang T.",2005,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33244461957&partnerID=40&md5=eae50519277971cf667888f0214d26fa
Inherent correlation between dose and clearance in therapeutic drug monitoring settings: Possible misinterpretation in population pharmacokinetic analyses,"During the course of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), doses are adjusted to attain a target concentration range and a correlation between clearance (CL) and dose is introduced. In population pharmacokinetic analyses of such TDM data, CL has frequently been modeled as a function of dose. This paper demonstrates by simulation methodology that the TDM process does indeed introduce a correlation between dose and CL which can be interpreted as a nonlinearity. Using literature values of carbamazepine pharmacokinetics, three steady-state concentrations were simulated following a standard 1000 mg total daily dose (TDD) regimen in 100 in silico subjects. A set of clinical rules was established to adjust the TDD based on these three concentrations, as might be done in the clinical setting. Another set of concentrations using these TDM-derived TDDs for each subject (600-1600 mg) was simulated. A standard population pharmacokinetic analysis of the post-TDM data was conducted using NONMEM. This process was replicated 100 times to estimate the type II error rate. When CL was modeled without TDD, plots of WRES versus PRED demonstrated a clear pattern, as did the delta plots of CL (CL minus TVCL) versus TDD, suggesting the covariate TDD should be incorporated into the model. After TDD was included in the model for CL, the objective function value decreased by an average of 75.7 (p < 0.001). In addition, the inter-individual variability in CL expressed as a coefficient of variation decreased by an average of 9.9% and the diagnostic plots improved. Although CL was simulated to be independent of TDD, it was identified as an important covariate using standard approaches in a simulated TDM setting in 100% of the replicated simulation studies. The TDM process introduces a correlation between CL and TDD that can be misinterpreted as nonlinearity in the system. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Ahn J.E., Birnbaum A.K., Brundage R.C.",2005,Scopus,10.1007/s10928-005-0083-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-28944452426&doi=10.1007%2fs10928-005-0083-6&partnerID=40&md5=0775311495fefdcd71dd9ea166022f2b
Risk reduction of on-board software development cycle,"In order to be competitive on the satellite market, ASP works hardly on development cycle reduction. The On Board Software (OBSW) product Is always on the satellite schedule critical path due to its own features : part of all embedded functional chains, product flexibility, late modifications possibility, etc .... and also due to the fact that the product is essential to all validation phases at Avionics, AIT and ground segment level. Consequently, the validation phase is a predominant effort of the complete OBSW development cycle, where each bug detection is extremely costly. The tendency of OBSW schedule reduction and the late bug detection cost impact have been mentioned in all report on the ""software crisis"" established by ESA, CNES, NASA etc ... and are the basis of Agencies software roadmap. To answer to this problematic, several axes are investigated at ASP software level: technologies evolution, process adaptation and product line strategy. This paper talks about one of our investigation axis: introduction of an original tool to the development cycle which really permits to pass a step in term of bug anticipation. Classical tools which allow to have static information on the code or to help developer in term of unit test phase as test pattern generator, dynamic analysis are out of scope of this article. The focus is really put on the use of new tool which detects defects at the earliest stage of a project. After a first use of IABC INRIA prototype tool in the scope of Proteus project (with the CNES support), the approach of the problematic taken by this tool had kept our attention: it is naturally that the first Polyspace Verifier industrialization version has been introduced on ASP on board software development process.

Practical methods for constructing suffix trees,"Sequence datasets are ubiquitous in modern life-science applications, and querying sequences is a common and critical operation in many of these applications. The suffix tree is a versatile data structure that can be used to evaluate a wide variety of queries on sequence datasets, including evaluating exact and approximate string matches, and finding repeat patterns. However, methods for constructing suffix trees are often very time-consuming, especially for suffix trees that are large and do not fit in the available main memory. Even when the suffix tree fits in memory, it turns out that the processor cache behavior of theoretically optimal suffix tree construction methods is poor, resulting in poor performance. Currently, there are a large number of algorithms for constructing suffix trees, but the practical tradeoffs in using these algorithms for different scenarios are not well characterized. In this paper, we explore suffix tree construction algorithms over a wide spectrum of data sources and sizes. First, we show that on modern processors, a cache-efficient algorithm with O(n 2) worst-case complexity outperforms popular linear time algorithms like Ukkonen and McCreight, even for in-memory construction. For larger datasets, the disk I/O requirement quickly becomes the bottleneck in each algorithm's performance. To address this problem, we describe two approaches. First, we present a buffer management strategy for the O(n 2) algorithm. The resulting new algorithm, which we call ""Top Down Disk-based"" (TDD), scales to sizes much larger than have been previously described in literature. This approach far outperforms the best known disk-based construction methods. Second, we present a new disk-based suffix tree construction algorithm that is based on a sort-merge paradigm, and show that for constructing very large suffix trees with very little resources, this algorithm is more efficient than TDD. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Tian Y., Tata S., Hankins R.A., Patel J.M.",2005,Scopus,10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-25844465842&doi=10.1007%2fs00778-005-0154-8&partnerID=40&md5=4063363a213be510e4cdcbbd162d49ab
Interference analysis and resource allocation for TDD-CDMA systems to support asymmetric services by using directional antennas,"This paper explores the advantages of using directional antennas in time division duplex (TDD) code division multiple access (CDMA) systems to support asymmetric traffic services. In the TDD-CDMA system, the transmission for asymmetric traffic from neighboring cells may cause the cross-slot interference, which can seriously degrade system capacity. To avoid the cross-slot interference for TDD-CDMA systems, many current resource allocation algorithms typically require a global control on the transmission direction (either downlink or uplink) in each time slot. Apparently, this requirement substantially constrains the flexibility of TDD-CDMA systems to deliver asymmetric traffic services in a more practical situation where every cell may have different uplink and downlink bandwidth requirements. We analyze the interference of the TDD-CDMA system with a trisector cellular architecture, where three directional antennas are employed at each base station. We find that the directivity of directional antennas can provide an additional degree of freedom for allocating radio resource. Taking advantage of this property, we introduce the concept of virtual cell, defined as the same converge area of a cell but is composed of three sectors from the three adjacent base stations. Furthermore, we propose a new virtual cell-based distributed code/time slot allocation algorithm to enable a TDD-CDMA system to provide asymmetric services with different rates of asymmetry in every cell coverage area. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm does not only offer more flexibility in handling nonuniform traffic patterns, but maintain good radio link performance and call blocking performance. © 2005 IEEE.","Wang L.-C., Huang S.-Y., Tseng Y.-C.",2005,Scopus,10.1109/TVT.2005.844660,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21244506265&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2005.844660&partnerID=40&md5=a260cbf95fb4afa4e2ea13ed53b6ecfd
Distributed topology construction of Bluetooth wireless personal area networks,"Bluetooth, a wireless technology based on a frequency-hopping physical layer, enables portable devices to form short-range wireless ad hoc networks. Bluetooth hosts are not able to communicate unless they have previously discovered each other through synchronization of their timing and frequency-hopping patterns. Thus, even if all nodes are within proximity of each other, only those nodes which are synchronized with the transmitter can hear the transmission. To support any-to-any communication, nodes must be synchronized so that the pairs of nodes, which can communicate with each other, form a connected graph. Using Bluetooth as an example, we first provide deeper insights into the issue of link establishment in frequency-hopping wireless systems. We then introduce an asynchronous distributed protocol that begins with nodes having no knowledge of their surroundings and terminates with the formation of a connected network topology satisfying all constraints posed by Bluetooth. An attractive protocol feature is its ease in implementation using the communication primitives offered by the Bluetooth Specification. © 2005 IEEE.","Salonidis T., Bhagwat P., Tassiulas L., LaMaire R.",2005,Scopus,10.1109/JSAC.2004.842567,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-15244359199&doi=10.1109%2fJSAC.2004.842567&partnerID=40&md5=ee2abd3c9f0db8e9f5c61ce7644bd9a2
Ultra High Power 365 nm Ultraviolet Light Emitting Diodes,"We fabricated ultra high power ultraviolet (UV) light emitting diodes (LEDs), whose emission wavelength is 365 nm. We found that, in order to improve the external quantum efficiency (ηex) of UV-LEDs, it is very important to reduce the optical self-absorption and the threading dislocation density (TDD) of epi-layers. Therefore, at first, UV-LEDs epi-layers were grown on high-quality GaN templates (TDD=l×l08/cm2) with sapphire substrates, and then the GaN templates and the sapphire substrates were removed by using laser-induced lift-off and polishing techniques. Moreover, in order to enhance the extraction efficiency, a higher reflectance Ag p-type electrode and patterned surface were used for this LED chip. As a result, we obtained the low self-absorption and low TDD UV-LEDs with practical high power and high quantum efficiency. © 2005, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Teaching Patterns and Software Design,"In this paper we describe our experiences with reengineering an undergraduate course in software design. The course's learning outcomes require that students can model, design and implement software. These are inherently practical skills and rely on functioning knowledge. To facilitate a learning environment in which students can acquire the necessary deep level of understanding, we have designed the course by applying the educational theory of constructive alignment and a number of proven techniques for teaching, learning, and assessment. Fundamentally, we have embraced the active learning paradigm that recognises that student activity is critical to the learning process. In this paper, we describe several active learning techniques that we have used including role play, problem solving and peer learning. We also describe two novel assessment techniques we have developed, holistic assessment and formative examination. In addition we describe how students work with JUnit, a popular unit testing tool, not as users but as developers by applying design patterns to extend it with new functionality.

Comparison of full-field digital mammography to screen-film mammography with respect to contrast and spatial resolution in tissue equivalent breast phantoms,"To determine if the improved contrast resolution of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) with reduced spatial resolution allows for superior or equal phantom object detection compared with screen-film mammography (SFM). Tissue equivalent breast phantoms simulating an adipose to glandular ratio of 50/50, 30/70, and 20/80 were imaged according to each manufacturers' recommendation with four full-field digital mammography units (Fuji, Sectra, Fischer, and General Electric) and a screen-film mammography unit (MammoMatII 2000, Siemens, Munich, Germany). A total of 20 images were obtained in both hard- and soft-copy formats. For the purpose of soft-copy display, the screen-film hard-copy images were digitized with a 50 μm micron scanner. Six radiologists, experts in breast imaging, and three physicists, experts in scoring mammography phantoms, participated in a reader study where each reader scored each phantom for visibility of line-pairs and for 24 objects (fibers, clusters of specks, and masses). The data were recorded, entered into a database, and analyzed by a mixed-effect model. The limiting spatial resolution in line-pairs per millimeter visible with the digital units was less, regardless of display modality used, than that provided by the screen-film unit. The difference was statistically significant for the General Electric (p < 0.01) and Fuji digital mammography units (p=0.03). With respect to the number of visible objects, a statistically significant higher number could be detected with the screen-film unit as compared to the Fischer (p<0.01) and Sectra (p < 0.01) digital mammography units, but there was no significant difference between the other digital units and screen film. Overall, there was significantly better performance on the 50/50 phantom than with the 30/70 and 20/80 phantoms (p =0.01, p < 0.01) for object visibility. For the digital mammography units, soft-copy display performed better than hard-copy display for the Fischer and Sectra images, but worse for Fuji and General Electric. In addition, soft-copy display of digitized screen-film images was significantly better than hard-copy display (p=0.02) of the original screen films for object visibility, but worse for spatial resolution. The higher contrast resolution of the FFDM units tested did not result in improved detection of line-pair resolution or objects in the phantoms tested versus screen-film mammography. The phantom performance of a digital mammography unit seems to be influenced by the type of detection task (line-pair resolution versus object visibility), the display modality (soft-copy versus hard-copy) chosen to score the phantoms, and the parenchymal pattern composition of the phantom. © 2005 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","Kuzmiak C.M., Pisano E.D., Cole E.B., Zeng D., Burns C.B., Roberto C., Pavic D., Lee Y., Seo B.K., Koomen M., Washburn D.",2005,Scopus,10.1118/1.2040710,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-27244459487&doi=10.1118%2f1.2040710&partnerID=40&md5=9a4cbe032adf33ee47327331bdb85e41
Eclat: Automatic generation and classification of test inputs,"This paper describes a technique that selects, from a large set of test inputs, a small subset likely to reveal faults in the software under test. The technique takes a program or software component, plus a set of correct executionssay, from observations of the software running properly, or from an existing test suite that a user wishes to enhance. The technique first infers an operational model of the software's operation. Then, inputs whose operational pattern of execution differs from the model in specific ways are suggestive of faults. These inputs are further reduced by selecting only one input per operational pattern. The result is a small portion of the original inputs, deemed by the technique as most likely to reveal faults. Thus, the technique can also be seen as an error-detection technique. The paper describes two additional techniques that complement test input selection. One is a technique for automatically producing an oracle (a set of assertions) for a test input from the operational model, thus transforming the test input into a test case. The other is a classification-guided test input generation technique that also makes use of operational models and patterns. When generating inputs, it filters out code sequences that are unlikely to contribute to legal inputs, improving the efficiency of its search for fault-revealing inputs. We have implemented these techniques in the Eclat tool, which generates unit tests for Java classes. Eclat's input is a set of classes to test and an example program execution - say, a passing test suite. Eclat's output is a set of JUnit test cases, each containing a potentially fault-revealing input and a set of assertions at least one of which fails. In our experiments, Eclat successfully generated inputs that exposed fault-revealing behavior; we have used Eclat to reveal real errors in programs. The inputs it selects as fault-revealing are an order of magnitude as likely to reveal a fault as all generated inputs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.","Pacheco C., Ernst M.D.",2005,Scopus,10.1007/11531142_22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-26444584996&doi=10.1007%2f11531142_22&partnerID=40&md5=89cf2c38292ce415a9cf2799d10977a7

Automatic identification of common and special object-oriented unit tests,"Common and special test inputs can be created to exercise some common and special behavior of the class under test, respectively. Although manually created tests are valuable, programmers often overlook some special test inputs. If programmers write down specifications, special or common tests can be automatically generated and selected by tools. However, specifications are not commonly written in practice. This research develops a novel approach for automatically identifying common and special unit tests for a class without requiring any specification. Given a class, our approach automatically generates test inputs and identifies common and special tests among the generated tests. Programmers can inspect these identified tests and use them to augment existing (manual) tests. Our approach is based on statistical algebraic abstractions, program properties (in the form of algebraic specifications) dynamically inferred from test executions. We use statistical algebraic abstractions to characterize program behavior.

Adaptive resource allocations for D-TDD systems in wireless cellular networks,"In this paper, we propose adaptive resource allocation algorithms for dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) systems in wireless cellular networks. Recently, D-TDD has gained much attention as an efficient duplex scheme for high-speed data communications, because adaptive switching ability enables a system to obtain statistical multiplexing gain by exploiting dynamic and asymmetric data traffic. However, it has been noted that strong co-channel interference can be present due to adaptive switching in a cellular network that uses frequency reuse. To suppress the effect of strong co-channel interference and obtain the benefit of D-TDD, we employ time slot allocation (TSA) strategy along with sector antenna layouts. In addition to bandwidths adaptation to the dynamic and asymmetric traffic pattern, we also change the transmission mode based on the channel state of each link. For each time slot, the modulation level can be adaptively selected from multilevel transmission modes, satisfying the required packet error rate (PER) performance. Hence, the algorithm not only suppresses co-channel interference by co-operative time slot allocation, but also adopts multi-level transmission modes, with different modulation formats and coding for each time slot, so that maximum spectral efficiency can be achieved. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of these systems. ©2004 IEEE.","Yun J., Kavehrad M.",2004,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-27744583033&partnerID=40&md5=30ac190dd9e161f6394243300ad4fac7
JAOUT: Automated generation of aspect-oriented unit test,"Unit testing is a methodology for testing small parts of an application independently of whatever application uses them. It is time consuming and tedious to write unit tests, and it is especially difficult to write unit tests that model the pattern of usage of the application they will be used in. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) addresses the problem of separation of concerns in programs which is well suited to unit test problems. What's more, unit tests should be made from different concerns in the application instead of just from functional assertions of correctness or error. In this paper, we firstly present a new concept, application-specific Aspects, which mean top-level aspects picked up from generic low-level aspects in AOP for specific use. It can be viewed as the separation of concerns on applications of generic low-level aspects. Second, this paper describes an Aspect-Oriented Test Description Language (AOTDL) and techniques to build top-level aspects for testing on generic aspects. Third, we generate JUnit unit testing framework and test oracles from AspectJ programs by integrating our tool with AspectJ and JUnit.

The transdermal potential is actual exist in the molecular to pass through skin. In is more significant that conductance Ga, Gl and Gc is described permeability of molecular through skin.

A novel link proportional dynamic channel assignment for TDD-CDMA systems with directional antennas,"The increasing demands for the higher data rates, the variations of the radio channel, and the inherent traffic asymmetry between the uplink and downlink impose many new challenges on spectrum and radio resource management in wireless networks. Time division duplex (TDD) is an efficient approach to combat the traffic asymmetry issues via adapting the resource (time slots) for uplink and downlink. However, asymmetric traffic will cause cross-slot co-channel interference, which can seriously degrade the system performance. This paper proposes a novel link-proportional dynamical channel assignment (LP-DCA) scheme with directional antennas to alleviate the impact of cross-slot interference in the code division multiple access (CDMA) system. The proposed scheme partitions the whole users in a sector into several groups according to their received link quality. Basically, the LP-DCA assigns the time slots with higher potential cross-slot interference to the group of users with better link quality, or vice versa. Through the simulation, we demonstrate that the LP-DCA can reduce the cross-slot interference significantly, thereby improving the system capacity.","Wang L.-C., Chen Y.-C.",2004,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2942685260&partnerID=40&md5=9ad451fd19b47b0985be2e1c2b8aeff9

A novel approach to achieve unequal error protection for video transmission over 3G wireless networks,"In this paper, we present a novel unequal error protection technique that enhances the video transmission quality over wireless networks. The case of application considered is a UMTS/TDD transmission system for H263 compressed and turbo-coded video sequences. The overall redundancy added to the compressed stream is non-uniformly distributed between the succeeding video frames in order to minimize the mean distortion over the transmitted sequence. The repartition of the redundancy on the video stream is optimized using an analytical approach which aims to alleviate the error propagation along the sequence. Different puncturing patterns of the rate 13 turbo-coder were considered in our simulations. The results obtained here are compared to those with a classical equal error protection scheme. We demonstrate that the gain in the system performances can reach 1.5 dB (in terms of the mean peak signal-to-noise ratio) without any significant increase in the transmission rate or the receiver complexity. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"ACA: Channel assignment in Ad hoc, 4G and beyond wireless networks with directional antennas","We recently devised a novel Ad hoc-Cellular (A-Cell) wireless network architecture consisting of mobile and fixed/conventional base stations and developed efficient mechanisms for routing, DCA, scheduling and CAC. We anticipate that such network architectures and schemes will play a vital role in enhancing future cellular communications. In this paper, we devise a new scheme for channel assignment based on optimal edge coloring, namely, A-Cell Channel Assignment (ACA). ACA is capable of utilizing a limited number of channels to enhance spatial reuse. In addition, it may be used in conjunction with ad hoc, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, and WiFi networks, among others.

Automatic extraction of object-oriented observer abstractions from unit-test executions,"Unit testing has become a common step in software development. Although manually created unit tests are valuable, they are often insufficient; therefore, programmers can use an automatic unit-test-generation tool to produce a large number of additional tests for a class. However, without a priori specifications, programmers cannot practically inspect the execution of each automatically generated test. In this paper, we develop the observer abstraction approach for automatically extracting object-state-transition information of a class from unit-test executions, without requiring a priori specifications. Given a class and a set of its initial tests generated by a third-party tool, we generate new tests to augment the initial tests and produce the abstract state of an object based on the return values of a set of observers (public methods with non-void returns) invoked on the object. From the executions of both the new and initial tests, we automatically extract observer abstractions, each of which is an object state machine (OSM): a state in the OSM represents an abstract state and a transition in the OSM represents method calls. We have implemented the Obstra tool for the approach and have applied the approach on complex data structures; our experiences suggest that this approach provides useful object-state-transition information for programmers to inspect unit-test executions effectively. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.","Xie T., Notkin D.",2004,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-540-30482-1_27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35048891581&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-540-30482-1_27&partnerID=40&md5=05a436b8f61fbf6e1d58697dc0f603e2

Putting a motor on the canoo WebTest acceptance testing framework,"User acceptance testing is finally getting the attention and tool support it deserves. It is imperative that acceptance tests follow the best practices and embody the critical success factors that have been established over the years for automated unit testing. However, it is often challenging for acceptance tests to be repeatable, readable, and maintainable due to the nature of the tests and the tools currently available for automation.

Transforming graph based scenarios into graph transformation based j unit tests,"This paper describes how the Fujaba CASE tool supports a semi-automatic transformation of usecase scenarios specified by so called story boards into automatic test specifications and test implementations. A story board is a sequence of graph snapshots showing the evolution of a graph based object structure during a typical example execution of an usecase. From such an example execution we automatically derive a test specification that executes the following three basic steps: First, a graph transformation is generated that creates an object structure serving as the test bed for the following steps. Second, we generate an operation that invokes the core method realizing the corresponding usecase. Third, we generate a graph test with a left-hand side corresponding to the graph structure described as result in the story board. On test execution, this graph test validates whether the object structure resulting from the usecase execution matches the results modeled in the usecase scenario. Support for this approach has been implemented within the Fujaba case tool. The approach has been validated in a major research project and in several student projects. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Geiger L., Zündorf A.",2004,Scopus,10.1007/978-3-540-25959-6_5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33644931731&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-540-25959-6_5&partnerID=40&md5=515470ab43ca442ebfcb75f3ad6fab9e

Isotropie air-interface in TD-SCDMA: Uplink synchronization control and its environment-dependent performance analysis,"This paper addresses the issues on implementation of an isotropic air-link technology for future 4G wireless. One straightforward way is to use open-loop and closed-loop uplink synchronization (ULS) control techniques to turn asynchronous uplink back to synchronous operation mode. The use of ULS control can greatly enhance bilateral data transmission throughput in both uplink and downlink channels of a mobile cellular as a direct result from improved transmission imparity between them. This is especially important for some applications where the traffic in the both links should be made equally high, such as video conferencing. This paper will also introduce a modeling method to analyze performance of ULS control in a mobile cellular system. It should be noted that, although this paper's study is carried out under the TD-SCDMA framework, the method can be equally applicable to any TDD-based 3G and 4G wireless systems that choose ULS control as the means to achieve isotropic air-link transmission. A numerical analysis based on propagation delay estimation will be used to derive probability of successful ULS control under consideration of the impact of different channel environments, such as reflection coefficients, propagation patterns, attenuation gradient and cell size, etc.","Chen H.-H., Yeh Y.-C., Chao C.-Y., Tsai C.-H., Chang W.-H.",2003,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-4143099104&partnerID=40&md5=14bc94a87d9ec5f4009ea950cfd8822c
Improved channel re-assigning for inter-system handover of 1.28 Mcps TDD/CDMA for IMT-2000,"This paper investigates the performance improvement of new channel re-assigning scheme during the inter-system handover from 1.28 Mcps TDD mode. Two proposed structures describes the use of asymmetric time-slot allocation pattern and the combination of time-slot allocation pattern of traffic channel. Each proposed scheme can be applied to the handover scenario to UTRA/FDD mode and UTRA/TDD mode with 3.84 Mcps chip rate from 1.28 Mcps TDD mode, respectively. Simulation results shows that the proposed structure attains the longer measurement time for target system to enhance the reliability of measurement and also increase the probability of successful synchronization.

We review current software engineering practices used in testing and explore how they may be applied to the specific realm of VR applications. We then discuss the ways in which current practices are insufficient to test VR application interaction and propose a testing architecture for addressing the problems.

Outer loop power control using channel-adaptive processing for 3G WCDMA,"In power control systems for wide-band code division multiple-access (WCDMA), the outer loop power control (OLPC) algorithm initially sets a target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) based on the required target Block Error Rate (BLER), assuming a particular channel condition. A mismatch between the BLER and the target SIR usually results since the actual and assumed channel conditions are rarely the same. This mismatch tends to be especially large at very low BLERs. The OLPC depends on cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) and often takes a long time to converge to the required target SIR for low target BLERs. In this paper a channel-adaptive algorithm is presented that controls the target SIR for downlink transmission in WCDMA TDD. The proposed algorithm characterizes the multipath channel profile using predefined multipath channel patterns and compensates for the channel/mapping errors. Link level simulations are conducted in various channel conditions defined by 3GPP and the ITU. The comparison in performance between the channel-adaptive algorithm and the generic ""jump algorithm"" is illustrated and conclusions are drawn.","Koo C.-S., Shin S.-H., DiFazio R.A., Grieco D., Zeira A.",2003,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0041470255&partnerID=40&md5=abc6fed5d198b7db22b23b1759148e70
Pharmacologically induced enhancement of recurrent inhibition in humans: Effects on motoneurone discharge patterns,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of spinal recurrent inhibition on human motoneurone discharge patterns. The tonic discharge activity of motor unit pairs was recorded in the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles during voluntary isometric contraction. While undergoing continuous intravenous saline (NaCl 0.9 %) perfusion, the subjects were given a short lasting injection of L-acetylcarnitine (L-Ac), which has been found to potentiate recurrent inhibition in humans. The variability, synchronization and coherence of the motor unit discharges were analysed during four successive test periods (lasting 2-3 min each). A significant decrease in the inter-spike interval (ISI) coefficient of variation was observed in the discharge patterns of the motor units tested in the ECR and not in the ADM, which were not accompanied by any consistent changes in the mean ISIs of the motor unit activity in either muscle. The L-Ac injection also led to a significant increase in the synchronization in half of the motor unit pairs tested in the ECR muscle (n = 29), whereas no consistent changes were observed with the ADM motor units (n = 25). However, coherence analysis failed to reveal any consistent differences in the incidence of significant values of coherence spectrum between the pre-injection and injection periods among the motor unit pairs tested with either saline or L-Ac injections, in either the ECR or ADM muscles. The contrasting effects on the variability and the synchronization of the motor unit discharges observed with ECR motoneurones known to undergo recurrent inhibition and with ADM motoneurones known to lack recurrent inhibition suggest that the drug may have specific effects which are mediated by an enhancement of the Renshaw cell activity. The decrease in the ISI variability is in line with the hypothesis that recurrent inhibition may contribute along with the post-spike after-hyperpolarization to limiting the influence of the synaptic noise on the firing times of steadily discharging motoneurones. The present data, which suggest that recurrent inhibition plays a synchronizing rather than a desynchronizing role, are in keeping with the fact that the Renshaw cells may provide an important source of common inhibitory inputs.","Mattei B., Schmied A., Mazzocchio R., Decchi B., Rossi A., Vedel J.-P.",2003,Scopus,10.1113/jphysiol.2002.033126,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037731342&doi=10.1113%2fjphysiol.2002.033126&partnerID=40&md5=fc336842242e6546d9664891402dcead
A new objective test for random-dot stereopsis in preverbal children [Ein neues objektives testverfahren für random-dotstereopsis bei präverbalen kindern],"Background: The Lang-Stereotest is at best half-objective in testing stereovision in preverbal children. We developed a new method which might objectively measure random-dot stereopsis in preverbal children. Patients and methods: We project two separate random-dot images into the left and right eye using a 3D-monitor. If both eyes are perfectly aligned and random stereopsis is present, the child perceives a stimulus. Four different stimulus positions are shown at random. An infrared oculography system objectively detects whether the stimuli are seen. By using a specific baby examination unit, testing is already feasible in infants. Results: We present the plots of two children with a positive (normal) and two with a negative (pathologic) response to random-dot stimuli. Conclusions: This new examination technique allows an objective assessment of random-dot stereopsis in non-verbal children. It permits us for the first time to study the development of stereovision under natural conditions. In future, the method may also be used to screen preverbal children for visual abnormalities.

Object-Oriented Reengineering Patterns,"The documentation is missing or obsolete, and the original developers have departed. Your team has limited understanding of the system, and unit tests are missing for many, if not all, of the components. When you fix a bug in one place, another bug pops up somewhere else in the system. Long rebuild times make any change difficult. All of these are signs of software that is close to the breaking point.Many systems can be upgraded or simply thrown away if they no longer serve their purpose. Legacy software, however, is crucial for operations and needs to be continually available and upgraded. How can you reduce the complexity of a legacy system sufficiently so that it can continue to be used and adapted at acceptable cost?Based on the authors' industrial experiences, this book is a guide on how to reverse engineer legacy systems to understand their problems, and then reengineer those systems to meet new demands. Patterns are used to clarify and explain the process of understanding large code bases, hence transforming them to meet new requirements. The key insight is that the right design and organization of your system is not something that can be evident from the initial requirements alone, but rather as a consequence of understanding how these requirements evolve. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

They were used as templates to deposit TiO2 thin films by the use of TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide) dissolved in toluene. Amorphous films were selectively deposited on silanol regions. Line width variation of the pattern was improved to be well below the current electronics design rule, 5%. Dielectric constant of an as-deposited TiO2 thin film, dielectric properties of TiO2Si interface and leakage current density were evaluated by measuring I-V and C-V charactersitics of the MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) device. Very low leakage current was observed under high electric fields and the TiO2 thin films with various thicknesses showed dielectric constant of 25-30, which is more than 6 times as large as that of a usual SiO2 dielectric layer. This result indicates that TiO2 thin films synthesized at room temperature can replace with SiO2 layers currently employed for gate dielectrics of MOSFETs (MOS field-effect transistors).","Koumoto K., Masuda Y., Wang D.J.",2003,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0346885659&partnerID=40&md5=8f034010f5e531af8d1902dd443fd18f
Calibration and electrical safety status of therapeutic ultrasound used by chiropractic physicians,"Background: Ultrasound therapy is a commonly used therapeutic modality within the chiropractic profession. Previous calibration studies of ultrasound units within the physical therapy communities in Scotland and Canada have shown that approximately two thirds of units tested did not conform to minimum calibration standards. Similar failure rates may exist in the chiropractic profession and need to be addressed. Objective: To determine whether ultrasound machines used by chiropractic physicians met established calibration and electrical safety standards, and to assess frequency of ultrasound therapy use. Design: This cross-sectional study tested 45 ultrasound units for ultrasonic output and electrical safety. Additionally, we asked the doctors to complete a short survey relating to education, usage, and maintenance of their ultrasound equipment. Results: Of the 45 machines tested, 44% failed either calibration or electrical safety inspection. Failure rate was age dependent (P ≤ .05). Only 2 of the 45 machines tested had been safety checked within the last year. Conclusions: A large percentage of ultrasound machines in chiropractic physicians' offices deliver too much or too little dosage to the patient. Electrical safety inspections also revealed a significant failure rate. Chiropractic physicians must become more aware of the requirement for yearly calibration and safety inspections, and understand that failure to maintain their equipment could result in loss of therapeutic effectiveness and pose a threat to the safety of their patients and staff.","Daniel D.M., Rupert R.L.",2003,Scopus,10.1016/S0161-4754(02)54130-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037366362&doi=10.1016%2fS0161-4754%2802%2954130-0&partnerID=40&md5=e42e516b303f2337b3ea3614db319f44
Impact of wideband directional propagation channel characteristics on adaptive beamforming,"Adaptive beamforming, using the Conjugate Gradient Normal Equation Residual problem, is applied to a base station array, in the UTRA-TDD up-link. A Wideband Directional Channel Model is used, characterising specific micro-cell, street-type scenarios. These differ in the number of mobile terminals, grouped and placed along the street axis, and on their distances to the base station. Time- and angle-of-arrival spreads, and on-the-air interference content are the main parameters inherently varied and analysed. The average beamforming gain and signal-to-noise ratio are evaluated, also varying the number of array elements. The high number of arriving correlated and closely correlated signals, together with the composed nature of the correlation matrix in the algorithm's cost function, result in that other than the MMSE solutions may lead to the best interference suppression, for the tested scenarios. Among the several weighted interfering power components, the most relevant is due to the delayed signals from all the other links. The combination of the number of arriving orthogonal codes, time-of-arrival and angle-of-arrival spreads condition beamforming performance: the number of array elements affect performance, depending on the mobile terminal distance to the base station, and on the number of active links: for short distances and large number of users, larger time-of-arrival spread degrades beamformer performance, over the opposing effect of angle-of-arrival spread; the number of active users affects beamforming gain especially in the case that delay spreads are larger, i.e., for shorter mobile terminal distances to the base station.","Gil J.M., Correia L.M.",2003,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037287176&partnerID=40&md5=d3e1df8c147b8b5d5afa11fe0b975b3e
Stimulus-response functions of single avian olfactory bulb neurones,"This study investigated olfactory processing in a functional context by examining the responses of single avian olfactory bulb neurones to two biologically important gases over relevant concentration ranges. Recordings of extracellular spike activity were made from 80 single units in the left olfactory bulb of 11 anaesthetised, freely breathing adult hens (Gallus domesticus). The units were spontaneously active, exhibiting widely variable firing rates (0.07-47.28 spikes/s) and variable temporal firing patterns. Single units were tested for their response to an ascending concentration series of either ammonia (2.5-100 ppm) or hydrogen sulphide (1-50 ppm), delivered directly to the olfactory epithelium. Stimulation with a calibrated gas delivery system resulted in modification of spontaneous activity causing either inhibition (47% of units) or excitation (53%) of firing. For ammonia, 20 of the 35 units tested exhibited a response, while for hydrogen sulphide, 25 of the 45 units tested were responsive. Approximate response thresholds for ammonia (median threshold 3.75 ppm (range 2.5-60 ppm, n=20)) and hydrogen sulphide (median threshold 1 ppm (range 1-10 ppm, n=25)) were determined with most units exhibiting thresholds near the lower end of these ranges. Stimulus response curves were constructed for 23 units; 16 (the most complete) were subjected to a linear regression analysis to determine whether they were best fitted by a linear, log or power function. No single function provided the best fit for all the curves (seven were linear, eight were log, one was power). These findings show that avian units respond to changes in stimulus concentration in a manner generally consistent with reported responses in mammalian olfactory bulb neurones. However, this study illustrates a level of fine-tuning to small step changes in concentration (<5 ppm) not previously demonstrated in vertebrate single olfactory bulb neurones. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Cochannel interference reduction in dynamic-TDD fixed wireless applications, using time slot allocation algorithms","In this paper, we consider a fixed wireless cellular network that uses dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD). We analyze the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) outage performance of a D-TDD fixed cellular system, and propose a scheme to improve the outage probability performance. First, outage probability is evaluated using an analytical model, when omnidirectional antennas are deployed at a base-station site and a subscriber site. Our model is verified, using Monte Carlo simulations. According to our investigation, the outage performance of the D-TDD system is severely limited by a strong interference from the cochannel cell on the downlink, while the reference cell is in the uplink cycle. To improve the outage performance during uplink receptions, we introduce two time-slot allocation methods, combined with sector antennas: the Max Min{SIR} and Max{SIR}. The Max Min{SIR} is an exhaustive search algorithm for assigning subscribers to a few extra uplink time slots, so as to maximize the minimum SIR expectation value over the extra uplink time-slots region. It is used as a performance benchmark in our analysis. Meanwhile, the Max{SIR} is a simpler and efficient algorithm for improving the outage performance. It is established that the performance difference between the two algorithms is not noticeable. Especially, the difference is negligible, when the dynamic range of the traffic pattern between uplink and downlink is small. Also, the outage performance of a system that employs the Max{SIR} algorithm combined with sectored antennas is compared to that of a system employing adaptive-array antennas. The proposed system shows promise, and offers a compromise between system complexity and network guaranteed availability.","Jeong W., Kavehrad M.",2002,Scopus,10.1109/TCOMM.2002.803991,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036811322&doi=10.1109%2fTCOMM.2002.803991&partnerID=40&md5=2db9b446711a56529d98433342386ba9
Redeposited limestones in the Upper Cretaceous succession of the Helvetic Argentera Massif at the Italy-France border,"The middle-Upper Cretaceous succession of the Alpine External Zone (Argentera Massif) consists of limestones redeposited on the European continental margin of the Tethys Ocean, north-east of the Provencal platform margin. This region was subjected to Late Cretaceous tectonic activity with the development of regional NW-SE and E-W trending folds. The succession that infills the ""Puriac Basin"" begins with a base-of-slope chaotic unit (0-70 m thick), of middle- late p.p. Turonian age. It overlaps an early-middle Turonian erosional unconformity and is followed upsection by a 430-530 m thick redeposited, calcareous unit (""Calcari del Puriac"", upper Turonian- Campanian p.p.). A truncation surface cuts the Cretaceous formations which were unconformably covered by Paleocene continental-shallow marine units, after regional folding and uplift. The Calcari del Puriac Fm is formed by three calcareous ""turbiditic"" units, respectively late Turonian - earliest Coniacian, Coniacian-Santonian p.p. and Santonian p.p.-Campanian p.p. in age. These units consist of a repetitive stack of (1) lenticular calcirudite - calcarenite lithosomes, which represent channel-fill bodies, followed by (2) sheet-shaped, mainly calcarenitic units, which are interpreted as depositional lobes, and (3) fine-grained redeposited calcarenites and pelagic calcilutites of basin-plain environment. Palaeocurrent indications, facies variations and compositional trends indicate that a carbonate shelf and slope system was located southwards of the Puriac Basin, supplying carbonate detritus to the redeposition processes. Moreover, the compositional trends indicate that rudist reefs supplied abundant detritus to the turbidite units dated as late Turonian and Coniacian - Santonian. From the Santonian onwards, terrigenous clasts were mixed with the limestone particles. This coincided with a severe decrease of platform shedding, which is suggested by the prevalence of limestone lithoclasts, mixed with pelagic biota and calcareous intraclasts, over the platform-derived granules. The evolution of the infill of the Puriac Basin points to synsedimentary tectonic activity, which caused the development of the Turonian and latest Cretaceous - Pateogene unconformities and contributed to the instability of the slope to the south of the basin. The stacking patterns of the turbidite units testifies to cycles of progradation and retrogradation of the platform during the late Turonian -Santonian span of time. A regressive trend towards exposure of the platform is suggested for the Santonian - Campanian, during which the basin history came to an end before Eoalpine uplift and erosion.","Bersezio R., Barbieri P., Mozzi R.",2002,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036340065&partnerID=40&md5=9c186d2b3ec4c441a4350e9d4d301e8f

Templated site-selective deposition of titanium dioxide on self-assembled monolayers,"TiO2 thin films were grown on several kinds of SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) using TC (titanium tetrachloride), TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide), or TE (titanium tetraethoxide) as a starting material. We discussed the thin film formation mechanism and improvement of feature edge acuity through controlling the reactivity by changing functional groups of starting material and the surface functional groups of SAMs. The deposition of TiO2 from TC or TDD solution was promoted in the silanol group, and the deposition was suppressed on OTS (octadecyltrichloro-silane) SAM. On the other hand, TE was deposited regardless of the type of surface functional group in the whole area of patterned SAMs. The silanol group, which has high hydrophilicity, accelerated the growth of TiO2, and the OTS SAM, which has hydrophobicity, suppressed the growth of TiO2. It is also clarified that the chlorine atom in the starting material has high reactivity with silanol groups of SAMs.","Masuda Y., Jinbo Y., Yonezawa T., Koumoto K.",2002,Scopus,10.1021/cm0107528,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036201847&doi=10.1021%2fcm0107528&partnerID=40&md5=59fb9382a66d47b20d26bff49dc2ab62
Spontaneous and odour evoked activity in single avian olfactory bulb neurones,"Extracellular single unit recordings were made from various depths in the left olfactory bulb of ten anaesthetised, freely breathing adult hens (Gallus domesticus) using glass insulated tungsten microelectrodes. The 66 spontaneously active neurons recorded had widely variable firing rates (mean 4.9 spikes/s, range 0.1-32.4 spikes/s) and variable temporal firing patterns (regular, bursting and random discharge). Interspike interval histograms were constructed for each unit and tested for goodness of fit to theoretical distributions. The activity of 23 units fitted gamma distributions, six units fitted lognormal distributions, three units fitted Weibull distributions, one unit fitted an exponential distribution and 11 units had bimodal distributions. Responses of some units to odour stimuli (Clove oil, Geraniol, Limonene and Ammonia all at 10% vapour saturation) delivered directly to the olfactory epithelium were examined. Odour stimulation modified spontaneous activity in 29 of the 44 units tested, causing either inhibition (56%) or excitation (44%) of firing. Of the 35 units stimulated with more than one odour, 15 responded to multiple stimuli, showing excitation or inhibition only or both inhibition and excitation, depending on the odour applied. Ammonia most commonly elicited a response (70% of applications) and all the odours were capable of inducing both inhibition and excitation of spontaneous firing. Examination of transverse sections of adult hen olfactory bulb in the region corresponding to the recording sites allowed unit recording depth to be related to cellular layers. There was some evidence of different neurone properties in each bulb layer. The spontaneous activity and odour responses observed resemble those seen in other vertebrate groups and the firing rates observed are between those previously reported for mammals and reptiles.

Enhanced photoluminescence from GaN grown by lateral confined epitaxy,"Lateral confined epitaxy (LCE) of GaN on Si substrates results in a reduction of thermal crack density with decreasing the lateral dimensions of the growth pattern. Below a critical size, crack-free GaN on Si is obtained. The intensity of band-to-band photoluminescence (PL) peak in LCE GaN is strongly enhanced with respect to uniformly grown GaN on Si. The present study rules out the effect of crack density, internal reflections (microcavity effects), as well as enhanced light extraction efficiency, and excitation or emission through preferred facets (shape effects) as the main factor in PL enhancement. It is shown that the reduction in threading dislocation density (TDD) along the edges of the LCE patterns improves the luminescence efficiency. The relative increase in high quality material (low TDD) with the reduction of LCE unit size is, thus, the main reason for the enhanced PL intensity. © 2002 American Institute of Physics.","Zamir S., Meyler B., Salzman J., Wu F., Golan Y.",2002,Scopus,10.1063/1.1432115,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036469569&doi=10.1063%2f1.1432115&partnerID=40&md5=06e1a21aa0858d1e916df60019918cf3
Distinct sensitizing effects of the cAMP-PKA second messenger cascade on rat dural mechanonociceptors,"Activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) second messenger cascade has been implicated in the induction of mechanical hyperalgesia by inflammatory mediators. We examined the role of this cascade in mechanical sensitization of nociceptive neurons that innervate the meninges, a process thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of headache syndromes such as migraine. Single unit activity was recorded in the trigeminal ganglion from 40 mechanosensitive dural afferents (conduction velocitity: 0.3-6.6 in s-1) and nine mechanically insensitive dural afferents (MIAs) (conduction velocitity: 0.3-2.8 in s-1) while stimulating the dura with a servo force-controlled stimulator or von Frey monofilaments, respectively. Local application to the dura of dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP, 100 μM), a stable membrane-permeant cAMP analogue, produced mechanical sensitization in the majority of mechanosensitive units (19/29, 66%). Two distinct patterns of mechanical sensitization were observed. Thirty-eight per cent of the units exhibited only a decrease in threshold (TH group), while 28% showed only an increase in suprathreshold responses (STH group). dbcAMP also induced mechanosensitivity in the majority of MIA units (6/9, 67%). dbcAMP-induced sensitization was blocked by the PKA inhibitors, Rp-cAMP (1 mM) and H-89 (100 μM). A mixture of inflammatory mediators induced both components of sensitization in the majority of mechanosensitive units tested. However, in each unit, PKA inhibitors blocked only one of the two effects (either TH or STH). Units that were classified as TH or STH also differed in their baseline stimulus-response slopes, thresholds and conduction velocities. These findings implicate the cAMP-PKA cascade in sensitization of dural mechanonociceptors and suggest that this cascade may produce sensitization through at least two different mechanisms operating in separate neuronal populations.","Levy D., Strassman A.M.",2002,Scopus,10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013175,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037082222&doi=10.1113%2fjphysiol.2001.013175&partnerID=40&md5=effa6b036f9c4c9ca75b17ba3a48a24d

Impact of closed-loop power control on SDMA/TDMA system performance,"Power control is an important system requirement in SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access) to compensate for inequality of signal quality among near-end and far-end terminals. This paper presents a closed-loop power control scheme in an SDMA system to achieve the optimal power allocation and beam pattern for both uplink and downlink in the entire network. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by computer simulation in terms of blocking rate and forced termination rate of a TDD-SDMA/TDMA system in a multi-cell wireless system, and it is also compared with an open-loop power control scheme. The numerical results show that the system with the closed-loop power control has significantly better performance than that with the open-loop power control.

Reducing no fault found using statistical processing and an expert system,"This paper describes a method for capturing avionics test failure results from Automated Test Equipment (ATE) and statistically processing this data to provide decision support for software engineers in reducing No Fault Found (NFF) cases at various testing levels.

The costs in terms of depot repair and user exchange dollars that are wasted annually for unresolved cases are graphically illustrated. A diagnostic data model is presented, which automatically captures, archives and statistically processes test parameters and failure results which are then used to determine if an NFF at the next testing level resulted from a test anomaly. The model includes statistical process methods, which produce historical trend patterns for each part and serial numbered unit tested. An Expert System is used to detect statistical pattern changes and stores that information in a knowledge base.

Interference suppression in TDD/CDMA cellular systems with asymmetric traffic using MVDR beamforming,"The primary advantage of the TDD system is to accommodate asymmetric traffic by allocating different numbers of uplink and downlink time slots. However, in the TDD/CDMA cellular system, uplink signals may suffer strong interference from the downlink transmission of neighboring base stations. This kind of opposite direction interference has adverse impact on the TDD/CDMA system performance. In this paper, we propose to apply the MVDR beamforming technique to suppress the opposite direction interference. We evaluate the uplink performance of the proposed technique by simulation. Moreover, by jointly employing transmit beamforming in all asynchronous cells, the TDD/CDMA cellular system can allow different rates of asymmetry in different cells. Thus, each cell can design its own pattern of slot allocation.","Chen C.-J., Wang L.-C.",2002,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036445643&partnerID=40&md5=6275f3913a9225b550b37df429712a79

Obviously, this requirement significantly limits one of the key advantages in the TDD system - enabling different rate asymmetry. We observe that the tri-sector cellular architecture possesses additional orthogonality inherently due to the directivity of directional antenna, which can provide an additional degree of freedom in allocating radio resource (i.e., time slots). Thus we propose a new distributed slot allocation algorithm based on the tri-sector cellular architecture. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is to enable a TDD-CDMA system to provide asymmetric services with different rates of asymmetry in all cells, thereby having more flexibility in handling uniform traffic patterns.","Wang L.-C., Huang S.-Y., Tseng Y.-C.",2002,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036058686&partnerID=40&md5=dfdfa00018df5aaa18940b8bf79318dd
Fabrication of micropatterned dielectric thin films on self-assembled monolayers,Nucleation process of TiO2 from a gaseous phase was well controlled in this paper. We present a novel process to realize selective deposition through heterogeneous nucleation and generate high-resolution micropatterns of TiO2 thin films from a gaseous phase. SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) of OTS (octadecyltrichloro-silane) were modified to generate methyl/silanol-pattern. They were used as templates to realize heterogeneous nucleation and deposit TiO2 thin films on only silanol regions by the use of TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide) from a gaseous phase. Homogeneous nucleation of TiO2 particles was well inhibited by controlling atmosphere and resolution of this pattern was well below 2.1%.,"Masuda Y., Wang D., Won Seon Seo, Koumoto K.",2002,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0036027883&partnerID=40&md5=96762b10c0ae5f7770a3b73b8ca23bc4
Alcohol use in South Africa: Findings from the South African community epidemiology network on drug use (SACENDU) project,"Objective: To provide community-level public health surveillance on alcohol misuse in South Africa and the associated negative consequences. Method: A descriptive, epidemiological study of alcohol use based on data gathered biannually from multiple sources over 4 years, including specialist treatment centers, trauma units, mortuaries, psychiatric facilities, and surveys of school students and arrestees. Networks were set up in five sentinel sites to facilitate the collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results: Indicators point to the widespread misuse of alcohol. Alcohol consistently dominates the demand for substance use disorders treatment services. In the second half of 2000, 51.1% (Cape Town) to 77.0% (Mpumalanga) of patients reported alcohol as their primary substance of abuse. A high proportion of patients in trauma units tested positive for alcohol in 2000, ranging from 40.3% (Durban) to 91.8% (Port Elizabeth). Similarly, a high proportion of mortality cases tested positive for alcohol, ranging from 40.3% (Durban) to 67.2% (Port Elizabeth). Although treatment demand is dominated by men and older persons, alcohol misuse occurs among all sectors. School surveys reflect harmful drinking patterns among students, with 53.3% and 36.5% of male students in Durban and Cape Town, respectively, reporting heavy-drinking episodes by Grade 11. Discussion: Alcohol misuse has a number of implications for public health policy, such as the need to develop protocols for the management of alcohol-positive patients in trauma units and to target prevention programs at heavy drinking by young people. Further monitoring of alcohol misuse and its associated negative consequences is required.","Parry C.D.H., Bhana A., Myers B., Plüddemann A., Flisher A.J., Peden M.M., Morojele N.K.",2002,Scopus,10.15288/jsa.2002.63.430,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035988555&doi=10.15288%2fjsa.2002.63.430&partnerID=40&md5=c481fceb6d8ded328505c2c68fb35609
Automatic calibration method using transmitting signals of an adaptive array for TDD systems,"Adaptive arrays are especially effective in reducing cochannel interference and increasing channel capacity in time-division duplex (TDD) mobile communication systems because, ideally, the optimum pattern formed in the receiving mode can be applied to the transmitting pattern. However, since the radiation pattern of the adaptive array is generally formed on a baseband, the amplitude and phase errors must be calibrated between the branches of the array due to individual differences in the radio frequency (RF) devices of the receivers and transmitters. Moreover, since these errors change over time due to temperature variations, real-time calibration is required. This correspondence proposes an Automatic Calibration method using Transmitting signals (ACT) for adaptive base station antennas that is suitable for TDD communication systems, i.e., it enables real-time calibration. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration method is demonstrated using an experimental adaptive array testbed.","Nishimori K., Cho K., Takatori Y., Hori T.",2001,Scopus,10.1109/25.966592,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035509983&doi=10.1109%2f25.966592&partnerID=40&md5=86c66f33a840e8293d55c040810cd876
Sensitisation of group III articular afferents to mechanical stimuli by substance P,"Objective: To examine the excitatory and sensitising effects of substance P (SP) on articular afferents in normal and acutely inflamed cat knee joints. Materials and methods: In anesthetised cats recordings were made from 15 group III (conduction velocity 2.5-20 m/s) and 25 group IV afferent units (conduction velocity < 2.5 m/s) of the medial articular nerve of normal and acutely inflamed knee joints. SP (10 and 100 μg) was administered close-arterially. Results: SP at doses of 10 μg and 100 μg activated less than 50% of both group III and group IV units. The proportion of SP-positive units was significantly higher in inflamed (10 of 21) than in normal joints (2 of 18). SP induced activity in initially silent units or increased ongoing activity after latencies varying from 2 s to 5 min. The SP-evoked activity had an irregular pattern, a variable duration, and was not related to the dose injected. Bolus injections of SP (100 μg) sensitised group III articular afferents but not group IV units to noxious movements of the joint, regardless whether the units were from normal or acutely inflamed joints. The responses to innocuous movements were not influenced by SP. Group III units, initially not activated by any movement, displayed vigorous discharges to noxious movements after close-arterial SP. In 3 group III units tested, the SP-induced augmentation of responses to noxious movements was not mimicked by close-arterial injection of histamine (3.3 μg). Conclusions: It is concluded that SP contributes to the sensitisation of a subpopulation of high-threshold articular afferents. Thus this neuronal mediator released peripherally in response to an injury or acute inflammation causes considerable changes in the mechanosensitivity of this subpopulation of nociceptive joint afferents.","Herbert M.K., Schmidt R.F.",2001,Scopus,10.1007/s000110050754,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034996583&doi=10.1007%2fs000110050754&partnerID=40&md5=fe3c823ea9f498b960a6ab7ad9eb6f91
Selective deposition and micropatterning of titanium dioxide thin film on self-assembled monolayers,"We succeeded in fabricating micropatterns of titanium dioxide thin films on SAMs (self-assembled monolayers). SAMs of OTS (octadecyltrichloro-silane) were formed on Si wafers, and were modified by UV irradiation using a photomask to generate methyl/silanol-pattern. They were used as templates to deposit titanium dioxide thin films by the use of TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide). Amorphous films with approximate compositions Ti/O/Cl/C = 1:2.2:0.17:0.37 were selectively deposited on silanol regions. Line width variation of the pattern of an as-deposited film was improved to be well below the electronics design rule, 5%. Annealing the films at high temperatures (400-600 °C) gave rise to an anatase phase, while the resolution of a micropattern remained unchanged.","Masuda Y., Sugiyama T., Lin H., Seo W.S., Koumoto K.",2001,Scopus,10.1016/S0040-6090(00)01761-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034831451&doi=10.1016%2fS0040-6090%2800%2901761-2&partnerID=40&md5=b78845d1cf90e3e7f0ce3f95bcb87a46
A novel configuration for realizing automatic calibration of adaptive array using dispersed SPDT switches for TDD systems,This paper proposes a hardware configuration using only single pole dual throw (SPDT) switches to realize the previously proposed automatic calibration method using transmitting signals (ACT) for the adaptive array in TDD communication systems. The proposed configuration obtains the same calibration values as the conventional ACT does while reducing the number of switch branches. The transmission pattern using the proposed calibration method is also presented based on an experimental adaptive array testbed in an actual microcell environment. The experimental results show that the ideal radiation pattern formation is achieved by employing the proposed calibration method in an environment with a moving terminal station and where arriving co-channel interference exists.,"Nishimori K., Cho K., Takatori Y., Hori T.",2001,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035444942&partnerID=40&md5=a75b377f231897c6d183a7ad2625228c
Dynamic-TDD and optimum slot-allocation in fixed cellular systems,"Dynamic TDD (D-TDD) has gained attention as a means to deliver high dense two-way traffic. However, the outage performance of D-TDD system is severely limited by the strong interference from co-channel cells in a downlink cycle, while the reference cell is in its uplink duty cycle. To suppress the co-channel interference during uplink reception, we consider two kinds of time slot allocation strategies, combined with sector antennas: MaxMin {SIR} and Max {SIR}. MaxMin {SIR} is an optimum time slot allocation strategy, in the sense that it maximizes the minimum signal to interference ratio expectation value over extra uplink time slot region. It is used as a performance benchmark in our analysis. Meanwhile, Max {SIR} is a simple and efficient algorithm to improve outage performance. It is established that the performance difference between the two algorithms is not noticeable, especially when the dynamic range of traffic pattern between the uplink and downlink is small. Also, outage performance comparison between Max {SIR} algorithm and adaptive array antennas is provided. The proposed system shows promise and offers a compromise between system complexity and the desired availability.","Jeong W., Kavehrad M.",2001,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035183636&partnerID=40&md5=b28d361f59a1900659855daf6b73674d
Transmit multi-antenna diversity for TDD MC-CDMA,"In the previous work [3], we have proposed a selection type transmit diversity scheme for TDD MC-CDMA with asymmetric modulation on duplex channel. In the scheme, the performance degraded rapidly at a large number of users even though it showed good performance at a small number of users. In this paper, we propose a new transmit diversity scheme for TDD MC-CDMA system using multiple antennas. Computer simulation is carried out to evaluate the system performance and the performance is compared with that of the selection type transmit diversity scheme. From the simulation results, it is found that the proposed system has a good performance at a large number of users and thus, the transmit diversity scheme should be chosen applicably at the base station according to the number of users.","Jeong I., Kwon D., Nakagawa M.",2001,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035183590&partnerID=40&md5=76e0fc0a05837091cecd0935f28aed96
A downlink multiplexing method in TDD packet radio networks with a multibeam adaptive array,"A PRMA permitting multiple reservation with a multibeam adaptive array has been investigated considering uplink performance improvement. In this paper, a downlink multiplexing method for TDD packet radio networks with the multibeam adaptive array is investigated. The transmission weight is calculated using the array response vector obtained in uplink, and downlink SINR of each terminal is estimated from the obtained weights to decide multiplexing possibility. In downlink slots, the base station searches states of downlink slots in the previous frame for the number of multiplexing users. If it is not equal to the maximum, the base station selects terminals, additionally or newly, from limited terminals with long packet delay. The computer simulation results show the improvement in throughput and average packet delay without increasing processing load.","Higashinaka M., Ohgane T., Ogawa Y.",2001,Scopus,10.1109/VTC.2001.956412,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035183437&doi=10.1109%2fVTC.2001.956412&partnerID=40&md5=7439bab3f8082d7c9c74e565b5d3da62
An adaptive time slot allocation strategy for W-CDMA/TDD system,"The code division multiple access system with time division duplex mode (CDMA/TDD) where the same frequency allocation is made for both uplink and downlink is a good solution when the traffic asymmetry between uplink and downlink exists. However, when the asymmetry of each cell may be significantly different from each other, the traffic may experience severe interference from each other when each cell's own slot allocation is made according to the level of traffic asymmetry in each cell. The interference in the W-CDMA/TDD system when the slot allocations are made according to traffic patterns of each cell is analyzed, and a time slot allocation scheme considering the traffic asymmetry is proposed. In this paper, system performances are simulated under the proposed time slot allocation strategy and its optimal operation of the strategy is investigated.","Lee J., Han H., Kwon D.",2001,Scopus,10.1109/VETECS.2001.944053,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035183188&doi=10.1109%2fVETECS.2001.944053&partnerID=40&md5=53a569cb88a752f88b7920802b9a7a45
A novel space-time pre-multiuser downlink transmission scheme suitable for TDD-CDMA systems,"The conventional downlink selective transmission method is extended from the space domain to the space-time domain. Based on the cascade and joint processing in space-time domain, a so-called temporal beamformer and a space-time beamformer are presented. Then a novel downlink selective transmission scheme suitable for TDD-CDMA systems is proposed. The theoretical analysis and computer simulations demonstrate that the interference canceling performance of our approach is superior to that of the conventional spatial beamformer by sufficiently utilizing the space-time signature of mobile users. The proposed space-time joint method is superior to the space-time cascade method in terms of the interference canceling performance.","Wang W., Wu X., Yin Q.",2001,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035180916&partnerID=40&md5=3c8e284ad40629020814c040c2b26d1d
Time slot allocation scheme based on a region division in CDMA/TDD systems,"In wireless multimedia networks, there exists traffic asymmetry between uplink and downlink channels. The CDMA/TDD system can alleviate this problem, however, previous work in this area can not manage efficiently the traffic asymmetry among cells. In this paper, we propose a new time slot allocation scheme that considers the traffic pattern of each cell. To solve the inter-cell interference problem, we divide a cell's area into two regions and we allocate the resource of crossed slots to mobile stations which are existing in the inner-region. This proposed scheme increases the resource utilization and decreases the blocking probability of the system as a whole. And our DARD(Different time slot Allocation based on a Region Division) scheme outperforms conventional SA(Same time slot Allocation) scheme in the heterogeneous traffic environment.","Wie S.-H., Cho D.-H.",2001,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035176920&partnerID=40&md5=ea017e71d5a99b02a92421c398ed5389
More about the missing Tethys in the Yarlung Zangbo suture,"The Yarlung-Zangpo suture zone, the youngest in Tibet, marks a site of collision of the Eurasia continent and Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by a discontinuous line of ophiolitic bodies in southern Tibet and beyond. Terranes of different tectonic affinity are scattered along this line and represent remnants of the Tethys, a wide oceanic expanse existed throughout the Mesozoic and eventually closed along the suture in the Eocene. These terranes are targets of an extensive study by the Tibet Research Group, HKU aimed at more comprehensive understanding of the Tethys closure and tectonic evolution of the suture. Here results of structural and biostratigraphic investigation of the Bainang terrane are presented. The Bainang terrane, distinguished in the central part of the suture, comprises rock units previously referred to as infra-ophiolitic thrust sheets of radiolarites or Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous red radiolarites. It is situated between the ophiolitic suite of the Dazhuqu terrane to the north and Indian passive margin series to the south. The terrane is characterized by a pile containing numerous north-facing and chiefly south-verging imbricated slices. These tectonic slices incorporate various lithologies: chert, siliceous and tuffaceous mudstones, limestone, siliceous and calcareous shales. The most complete and well-exposed piece of the terrane near Bainang has been mapped and sampled for radiolarian biostratigraphic study. Five litho-tectonic units are discriminated on the basis of characteristic lithologies and structural styles. From north to south they are: Bangga, Zongxia, Maniga, Yalongmai and Renchingang units. The Bangga unit is mostly composed of red ribbon chert with minor siliceous mudstone and is characterized by scattered shear zones bounding tectonic slices and lenses several tens of meters thick. The Zongxia unit comprises predominant siliceous mudstone with numerous tectonic lenses of red ribbon chert. Conjugate tectonic lenses bounded by shear zones is a dominant structure. In both units obtained radiolarians indicate that chert is Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous and siliceous mudstone accumulated in a short interval from middle to upper Aptian. Random distribution of radiolarian ages along several profiles across the Bangga unit testifies for a rather complex internal structure. The Maniga unit is made up of more diverse lithologies which include: (1) Upper Triassic-Middle Jurassic micritic limestone, calciturbidites, siliceous-calcareous rocks, and varicolored calcareous mudstone; (2) Aalenian-Bajocian ferruginous chert; (3) Bajocian-Oxfordian tuffaceous chert and mudstone, basic tuff and silicified tuff; and (4) Kimmerigian-Tithonian red ribbon chert. Rocks of the unit are intensely sheared with typical phacoidal and S-C fabrics. Intensity of shearing progressively increases southwards (across strike) and eastwards (along strike). To the south, this part of the terrane merges to the Yalongmai unit that includes the same lithologies but with a greater proportion of calcareous mudstone. Rocks are more intensely sheared and structural style is characterized by penetrative foliation with stretching lineation deformed by later sporadically developed crenulation and abundant kink bands. In the southernmost Renchingang unit the predominant lithology is gray calcareous shale with protoliths of meter-thick calciturbidites. Subordinate red radiolarian chert and varicolored calcareous shale compose thin and disrupted but traceable tectonic slices. Structural style is the same as for the previous unit. In general, structure of the Bainang terrane is characterized by slice imbrication with elements of large-scale ramp folds comparable to that of other accretionary wedges. A vertical rather than lateral growth of the wedge is most likely mirrored in the structural patterns of the studied fragment. A long history of sedimentation supposedly in different and separate parts of the Tethys is recorded in the reconstructed stratigraphic columns for different units. The youngest rocks incorporated into the Bainang accretionary wedge are mid-upper Aptian siliceous mudstones, hemipelagic deposits similar to lithologies known from many accretionary wedges on-land. The earliest stage of subduction-accretion is thus inferred to have begun by the end of the Aptian as recorded in the studied fragment of the terrane. Although the Aptian siliceous mudstones of two northerly units possess abundant and sometimes thick tuff layers, the lack of any other clastic rocks shed off a volcanic arc is characteristic for this piece of the accretionary wedge. We suggest this may indicate an intra-oceanic setting for this remnant of the accretionary system. Another feature of the terrane is numerous basic sills that intruded rocks of the three southernmost units prior to shearing. The sills probably originated from pre-Kimmeridgian oceanic intra-plate alkaline basic magmatism on the Tethys floor close to the Indian subcontinent.","Ziabrey S., Aitchison J., Badengzhu, Davis A.M., Liu J., Luo H.",2001,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035041797&partnerID=40&md5=ff4785724f3bbbe7d8b405d3feeca0b5
MAC scheduling policies with reduced power consumption and bounded packet delays for centrally controlled TDD wireless networks,"In networks with mobile nodes, power consumption is an important constraint due to the limited battery power available at the mobile nodes. Reduction of power consumption in mobile devices can be achieved by keeping these devices in a low power (standby) mode during periods of inactivity. This may, however, result in increased end-to-end delays leading to violation of the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. In this paper, we propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) scheduling policies for centrally controlled TDD wireless systems. The proposed policies reduce the power consumption of mobile devices by putting them into low power mode intelligently, using probabilistic estimates of inactivity based on the previous traffic arrival pattern. The policies ensure that the QoS parameters such as end-to-end packet delays are not violated.","Chakraborty I., Kashyap A., Kumar A., Rastogi A., Saran H., Shorey R.",2001,Scopus,10.1109/ICC.2001.936936,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034849863&doi=10.1109%2fICC.2001.936936&partnerID=40&md5=bf32315de8ca9de1eb280f24c91bf2c4
Synchronizability of general periodic pattern signals,"In this paper an optimum and sub-optimum maximum likelihood (ML) rule for joint frame and carrier frequency offset estimation are derived, which rely on the transmission of a periodic pattern signal with an arbitrary number of periods and period length, embedded in the random data signal of a single user. Ad-hoc modification of the ML rule yields a robust metric for pattern search in a multi-user signal in a time division multiple access and time division duplex (TDMA/TDD) system, and a receiver with automatic gain control keeping constant average signal power at the synchronizer input. The mean, variance and Cramer-Rao Bound of the frequency offset estimate as well as the mean and variance of the frame estimate are theoretically evaluated and verified by simulation. The presented material proposes a unified framework for synchronization by periodic pattern signals and provides some new results, which are compared to known references.","Stantchev Branimir, Fettweis Gerhard",2000,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033712251&partnerID=40&md5=92179922cfcabf2cfbeecc7ec5cdfabc
Cell proliferation in skin tumors with ductal differentiation: Patterns and diagnostic applications,"The kinetic features of skin tumors with ductal differentiation (TDD) remain mainly unknown. We selected 88 skin TDD (D-PAS-positive cuticles) classified according to Murphy and Elder's criteria. Tumors studied included 13 poromas, 12 nodular hidradenomas, 10 cylindromas, 6 spiradenomas, 9 syringomas, 9 chondroid syringomas, 7 porocarcinomas, 15 malignant nodular hidradenomas, and 7 not otherwise specified carcinomas. The same tumor areas were evaluated for mitotic figure counting (MFC) and proliferation rate (PR = MIB-1 index), screening 10 consecutive high-power fields (HPFs) in the most cellular areas. Results were recorded by HPF and tumor cellularity, considering both average and standard deviation. Differences were analyzed by Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and considered significant if p<0.05. PR was significantly higher in malignant (23.29±12.49) than in benign tumors (3.86±4.44) and in poromanodular hidradenoma (4.99±3.34) than in spiradenoma-cylindroma-syringoma (1.91±1.67), but not by malignant tumor type. MFC was significantly higher in malignant (25.52± 4.10) than in benign tumors (1.57±0.38), showing porocarcinomas the biggest MFC/10 HPF and malignant nodular hidradenomas the highest MFC/1000 cells. PR and MFC are useful malignancy criteria in skin TDD and should be evaluated by tumor cellularity to avoid potential misinterpretations related with tumor heterogeneity.

Substantia nigra pars reticulata units in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats: Responses to striatal D2 dopamine receptor stimulation and subthalamic lesions,"In order to increase our understanding of Parkinson's disease pathophysiology, we studied the effects of intrastriatally administered selective dopamine receptor agonists on single units from the substantia nigra pars reticulata of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats with or without an additional subthalamic nucleus lesion. Nigral pars reticulata units of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were classified into two types, showing regular and bursting discharge patterns, respectively ('non-burst' and 'burst' units). Non-burst and burst units showed distinct responses to intrastriatal quinpirole (the former were excited and burst units inhibited). Furthermore, subthalamic nucleus lesions significantly decreased the number of nigral units showing a spontaneous bursting pattern, and reduced the proportion of units that responded to quinpirole. In contrast, subthalamic lesions did not alter the proportion of nigral units that responded to SKF38393, although the lesions changed some response features, e.g. response type and magnitude. Burst analysis showed that quinpirole did not modify the discharge pattern of burst units, whereas SKF38393 produced a shift to regular firing in 62 of the burst units tested. In conjunction, our results support that: (i) the subthalamic nucleus has an important influence on output nuclei firing pattern; (ii) striatal D2 receptors have a strong influence on nigral firing rate, and a less relevant role in controlling firing pattern; (iii) burst and non-burst units differ in their response to selective stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors; (iv) the effects of striatal D2 receptors on nigral units are mainly, though not exclusively, mediated by the subthalamic nucleus; and (v) nigral responses to SKF38393 involve the subthalamic nucleus.","Tseng K.Y., Riquelme L.A., Belforte J.E., Pazo J.H., Murer M.G.",2000,Scopus,10.1046/j.1460-9568.2000.00910.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033957631&doi=10.1046%2fj.1460-9568.2000.00910.x&partnerID=40&md5=d5f1b552113138d1ee0fe95231d7dd9e
The neural code for taste in the nucleus of the solitary tract of the rat: Effects of adaptation,"Adaptation of the tongue to NaCl, HCl, quinine or sucrose was used as a tool to study the stability and organization of response profiles in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Taste responses in the NTS were recorded in anesthetized rats before and after adaptation of the tongue to NaCl, HCl, sucrose or quinine. Results showed that the magnitude of response to test stimuli following adaptation was a function of the context, i.e., adaptation condition, in which the stimuli were presented. Over half of all taste responses were either attenuated or enhanced following the adaptation procedure: NaCl adaptation produced the most widespread, non-stimulus-selective cross-adaptation and sucrose adaptation produced the least frequent cross-adaptation and the most frequent enhancement of taste responses. Adaptation to quinine cross-adapted to sucrose and adaptation to HCl cross-adapted to quinine in over half of the units tested. The adaptation procedure sometimes unmasked taste responses where none were present beforehand and sometimes altered taste responses to test stimuli even though the adapting stimulus did not itself produce a response. These effects demonstrated a form of context-dependency of taste responsiveness in the NTS and further suggest a broad potentiality in the sensitivity of NTS units across taste stimuli. Across unit patterns of response remained distinct from each other under all adaptation conditions. Discriminability of these patterns may provide a neurophysiological basis for residual psychophysical abilities following adaptation.

A software component verification tool,"Component based software engineering depends on reliable, robust components, since it may omit a unit test phase wholly or partially from the development cycle.

Once specified, test specifications and test results are stored in XML documents, providing a standard, portable form of storing, retrieving and updating test histories. One module of our component test bench, the test pattern verifier, has been designed to be general, lightweight and portable, so that it can be packaged with a component and its test specifications. This allows a component user to verify a component's compliance with specifications in a target environment. © 2000 IEEE.","Bundell G.A., Lee G., Morris J., Parker K., Lam P.",2000,Scopus,10.1109/SWMT.2000.890429,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84961659638&doi=10.1109%2fSWMT.2000.890429&partnerID=40&md5=baa6803d32cab2a2a776da55d1e295d5
A speech-optimised multiple access scheme for a mobile ad hoc network,We propose a multiple access scheme based on Time Division Duplexing (TDD) for peer-to-peer speech communications in a short-range mobile ad hoc network of wireless nodes. This reservation-based packet-switched scheme aims to improve the utilisation of radio channel by taking into account the on-off patterns of speech. The TDD frame suggested for the channels is divided into a control sub-frame and an information sub-frame. The Busy Indication control packets used to indicate the slot reservation is aimed at disseminating the channel status to new nodes joining the network and to ensure a collision-free data channel. © 2000 IEEE.,"Muthiah V.N., Wong W.C.",2000,Scopus,10.1109/MOBHOC.2000.869220,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-4143074538&doi=10.1109%2fMOBHOC.2000.869220&partnerID=40&md5=aa9daa14e746a4e22d47f3803b8f657e
Dual task-related changes in the synchronous activity of wrist extensor type-identified motor units in humans,"The coupling between the firings of 33 pairs of motor units tested in the extensor carpi radialis muscles was evaluated by cross-correlation analysis and compared during isometric wrist extension and hand clenching. A slightly greater amount of synchrony was observed during hand clenching (0.042 ± 0.024 vs 0.035 ± 0.017 synchronous impulses per trigger). This trend did not reach however the level of significance and the changes were actually found to be heterogeneous: in 15 out of the 33 pairs tested, synchronous activity with a narrow coupling (4.6 ± 2.4 ms) consistent with short-term synchrony was greater during hand clenching whereas in nine other pairs, synchronous activity with a broader dispersion (9.0 ± 4.5 ms) was reduced. These opposite changes could not be explained in terms of changes in the firing pattern of the motor units and were found instead to correlate with the motor units' biomechanical properties. Motor units with high recruitment thresholds and fast rising twitches showed predominantly an increase in synchrony; whereas the motor unit pairs with low recruitment thresholds and slow twitches showed either an increase or a decrease. The enhanced short-term synchrony suggests that common inputs distributed to motoneurones of all types were more effective during hand clenching whereas the decrease in weakly coupled synchronous activity suggests that other inputs synchronized at a pre-synaptic level and distributed more specifically to motor units recruited at low force levels were less effective. The possible origins of the inputs reflected in the dual changes are discussed in terms of the supra-spinal and peripheral pathways controlling the wrist extensor motoneurones during wrist extension and hand clenching.","Sturm H., Schmied A., Vedel J.-P., Pagni S.",2000,Scopus,10.1080/08990220050020599,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034034149&doi=10.1080%2f08990220050020599&partnerID=40&md5=4e1a55add7c4a39cf34586c4248c0360
Neural measurement of sound duration: Control by excitatory-inhibitory interactions in the inferior colliculus,"In the inferior colliculus (IC) of the big brown bat, a subpopulation of cells (~35%) are tuned to a narrow range of sound durations. Band-pass tuning for sound duration has not been seen at lower levels of the auditory pathway. Previous work suggests that it arises at the IC through the interaction of sound-evoked, temporally offset, excitatory and inhibitory inputs. To test this hypothesis, we recorded from duration-tuned neurons in the IC and examined duration tuning before and after iontophoretic infusion of antagonists to γ-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) (bicuculline) or glycine (strychnine). The criterion for duration tuning was that the neuron's spike count as a function of duration had a peak value at one duration or a range of durations that was γ2 times the lowest nonzero value at longer durations. Out of 21 units tested with bicuculline, duration tuning was eliminated in 15, broadened in two, and unaltered in four. Out of 10 units tested with strychnine, duration tuning was eliminated in four, broadened in one, and unaltered in five. For units tested with both bicuculline and strychnine, bicuculline had a greater effect on reducing or abolishing duration tuning than did strychnine. Bicuculline and strychnine both produced changes in discharge pattern. There was nearly always a shift from an offset response to an onset response, indicating that in the predrug condition, inhibition arrived simultaneously with excitation or preceded it. There was often an increase in the length of the spike train, indicating that in the predrug condition, inhibition also coincided with later parts of excitation. These findings support two hypotheses. First, duration tuning is created in the IC. Second, although the construction of duration tuning varies in some details among IC neurons, it follows three rules: 1) an excitatory and an inhibitory event are temporally linked to the onset of sound but temporally offset from one another; 2) the duration of some inhibitory event must be linked to the duration of the sound; 3) an excitatory event must be linked to the offset of sound.","Casseday J.H., Ehrlich D., Covey E.",2000,Scopus,10.1152/jn.2000.84.3.1475,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033818315&doi=10.1152%2fjn.2000.84.3.1475&partnerID=40&md5=971e06063d3e3f9e4695092370276ea4
Weight estimation for downlink null steering in a TDD/SDMA system,"In employing an adaptive array for TDD/SDMA at a base station, generally, the array pattern for downlink is calculated from that for uplink. Considering the angle spread in a Rayleigh fading channel, time difference between uplink and downlink causes null position change on the optimum array pattern. In this paper, we propose the weight estimation method for the downlink null steering. It is based on the indirect weight estimation using the channel response prediction. The computer simulations show that the proposed method improves the BER performance in the downlink, effectively.","Kishiyama Y., Nishimura T., Ohgane T., Ogawa Y., Doi Y.",2000,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033698441&partnerID=40&md5=6531efc18af3aac9a95734f4ad0d0425

Capacity of CDMA/TDD systems for mobile multimedia services,"Traffic asymmetry between uplink and downlink is one of the most notable characteristics in wireless multimedia communications. The CDMA/TDD systems with unbalanced slot allocation can be a good solution for this problem. However, the level of traffic asymmetry may be significantly different from cell to cell. In this paper, we calculate the capacity of CDMA/TDD systems under given patterns of traffic asymmetry. Using the results, we investigate optimal slot allocation that maximizes the frequency utilization in terms of whole cellular system.","Jeong Dong Geun, Jeon Wha Sook",1999,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033358307&partnerID=40&md5=b7f73ccc6f37a62d7049063b91452868
Hemoglobin near-infrared spectroscopy and surface EMG study in muscle ischaemia and fatiguing isometric contraction,"Background. To assess how muscle ischaemia and isometric fatiguing contraction influence oxygen content in striated muscle. Methods. We simultaneously measured changes in hemoglobin near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and in surface EMG before, during, and after muscle ischaemia and ischaemia plus muscle isometric fatiguing contraction. Seventeen health male subjects (age range: 19-40 yrs) were examined in our Clinical Neurophysiology Unit. Test I (9 subjects): hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy and stimulated surface EMG were measured for 2 minutes at rest, for 4 minutes during complete ischaemia of tibialis anterior muscle, and for twelve minutes during recovery. Test II (all subjects): hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy and surface EMG were measured for 2 minutes with the subjects performing brief non-fatiguing contractions, for 4 minutes with the subject performing maximal isometric contraction in complete ischaemia, and for twelve minutes during recovery. EMG parameters measured: median density frequency (MDF); muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV). NIR spectroscopy parameters measured: percentage of amplitude decrement (%AD) and nadir time (NT) during ischaemia and ischaemic effort; half-recovery time ( 1/2 RT) from ischaemia effort. Results. At EMG, we observed a significant shift towards lower values of both MFCV and MDF during fatiguing isometric contraction. MDF recovery was faster then MFCV recovery. At NIR spectroscopy, the 1/2 RT slowed a fast pattern in twelve subjects and a slow pattern in five. A significant relationship was found between AD% and 1/2 RT values of test I and AD% and 1/2 values of test II. We found a positive relationship between NT and 1/2 RT in test II. Conclusions. Surface EMG and hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy can be applied simultaneously to evaluate both fatigue intensity and blood flow changes in striated muscle.","Alfonsi E., Pavesi R., Merlo I.M., Gelmetti A., Zambarbieri D., Lago P., Arrigo A., Reggiani C., Moglia A.",1999,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033056012&partnerID=40&md5=3d2d523197c4383570d9320e01319c3b
CDMA/TDD system for wireless multimedia services with traffic unbalance between uplink and downlink,"This paper proposes a code dimension multiple access (CDMA) time division duplex (TDD) system for wireless multimedia services with traffic unbalance between uplink and downlink. In the proposed system, the number of uplink time slots in a TDD frame differs from that of downlink. Moreover, the difference can be reset by the network operator according to the traffic pattern. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system under multimedia environment using Markov analysis and computer simulation. The results show that the frequency utilization is maximized even when the uplink and downlink traffic volumes are unbalanced. This, in turn, reduces drastically the blocking rate of multimedia calls (connections) in the proposed system compared with that in the traditional CDMA systems where the uplink and downlink use equal bandwidth.","Jeong D.G., Jeon W.S.",1999,Scopus,10.1109/49.768207,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032690268&doi=10.1109%2f49.768207&partnerID=40&md5=f96f0a3aead1cda66ade06bbbe9a48f1
Responses of medullary dorsal horn neurons to corneal stimulation by CO2 pulses in the rat,"Corneal-responsive neurons were recorded extracellularly in two regions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, subnucleus interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) and subnucleus caudalis/upper cervical cord (Vc/C1) transition regions, from methohexital-anesthetized male mrs. Thirty-nine Vi/Vc and 26 Vc/C1 neurons that responded to mechanical and electrical stimulation of the cornea were examined for convergent cutaneous receptive fields, responses to natural stimulation of the corneal surface by CO2 pulses (0, 30, 60, 80, and 95%), effects of morphine, and projections to the contralateral thalamus. Forty-six percent of mechanically sensitive Vi/Vc neurons and 58% of Vc/Cl neurons were excited by CO2 stimulation. The evoked activity of most cells occurred at 60% CO2 after a delay of 7-22 s. At the Vi/Vc transition three response patterns were seen. Type I cells (n = 11) displayed an increase in activity with increasing CO2 concentration. Type II cells (n = 7) displayed a biphasic response, an initial inhibition followed by excitation in which the magnitude of the excitatory phase was dependent on CO2 concentration. A third category of Vi/Vc cells (type III, n = 3) responded to CO2 pulses only after morphine administration (&gt; 1.0 mg/kg). At the Vc/C1 transition, all CO2-responsive cells (n = 15) displayed an increase in firing rates with greater CO2 concentration, similar to the pattern of type I Vi/Vc cells. Comparisons of the effects of CO2 pulses on Vi/Vc type I units, Vi/Vc type II units, and Vc/C1 corneal units revealed no significant differences in threshold intensity, stimulus encoding, or latency to sustained firing. Morphine (0.5-3.5 mg/kg iv) enhanced the CO2-evoked activity of 50% of Vi/Vc neurons tested, whereas all Vc/C1 cells were inhibited in a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible manner. Stimulation of the contralateral posterior thalamic nucleus antidromically activated 37% of Vc/C1 corneal units; however, no effective sites were found within the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus or nucleus submedius. None of the Vi/Vc corneal units tested were antidromically activated from sites within these thalamic regions. Corneal-responsive neurons in the Vi/Vc and Vc/C1 regions likely serve different functions in ocular nociception, a conclusion reflected more by the difference in sensitivity to analgesic drugs and efferent projection targets than by the CO2 stimulus intensity encoding functions. Collectively, the properties of Vc/C1 corneal neurons were consistent with a role in the sensory-discriminative aspects of ocular pain due to chemical irritation. The unique and heterogeneous properties of Vi/Vc corneal neurons suggested involvement in more specialized ocular functions such as reflex control of tear formation or eye blinks or recruitment of antinociceptive control pathways.","Hirata H., Hu J.W., Bereiter D.A.",1999,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1999.82.5.2092,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032693864&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1999.82.5.2092&partnerID=40&md5=8c9b8f95765617ffad737e8aa315596d

Down-link performance of interference canceller combining path pre-selecting adaptive array and cascaded equalizer,"In order to improve the capacity and quality of high-speed mobile communication systems, we proposed an interference canceller that combines a path pre-selecting adaptive array and a cascaded equalizer. The role of the adaptive array in the canceller is to reduce co-channel interference (CCI) and long-delayed inter-symbol interference (ISI). Thus, the cascaded equalizer needs less complexity. In this paper, we propose to apply the canceller to the base station (BS) of a TDMA/TDD system and to reuse the receiving beam pattern in transmission. Then, in the down-link, the BS emits only the desired signal and short-delayed ISI for a desired mobile station (MS). As a result, with a simple equalizer in the MS, we can get a sufficient path diversity gain also in the down-link. The average bit error rate (BER) performance of the system in a Rayleigh fading channel is calculated by computer simulation. The results show that a sufficient path diversity gain is obtained in the down-link as well as in the up-link.","Doi Yoshiharu, Ohgane Takeo, Karasawa Yoshio",1998,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032321290&partnerID=40&md5=c31bfaed54df8dcf1ff7cb5e478ebb38
Power control for diversity reception in Time-Division Duplex CDMA,"Power control possibilities are explored for the downlink of a Time-Division Duplex (TDD) CDMA system while employing three different kinds of multipath diversity combining schemes namely the RAKE, the pre-RAKE and the transmit antenna pre-selection. In the latter two, knowledge of the channel characteristics is employed at the base-station to provide maximum decoupling between users on the downlink. performance of the these receivers is compared in a Rayleigh fading urban environment. It is shown that power control is absolutely indispensible in the latter two schemes and results in considerable performance gains as compared to the RAKE receiver.","Ghauri Irfan, Knopp Raymond",1998,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032319958&partnerID=40&md5=ee79c36af88e719b25a39145e9ba0d6e

Acoustic transmission in the dentate nucleus I. Patterns of activity to click and hiss; II. Changes in activity and excitability after conditioning,"Recordings were made from 95 units of the dentate nucleus of naive cats to determine if patterns of response to 70 dB clicks could be distinguished from those to another acoustic stimulus (a hiss) of approximately equal sound pressure level. Further studies of an additional 309 units were conducted to determine if unit excitability and the response to clicks changed after Pavlovian conditioning in which blink responses were elicited by the clicks as conditioned stimuli. Over 50% of units tested before conditioning responded to click or hiss with increased activity, and 8% responded in the first 4-8 ms after the onset of the rapidly rising click. Cross-correlation of the respective 160 ms poststimulus histogram averages of mean activity showed dissimilar patterns of response to clicks and hisses (Pearson product- moment correlation coefficient + 0.02). Thus the averaged population responses distinguished these stimuli. In addition, individual cells were found in each behavioral state that responded selectively to either click or hiss. After conditioning with click as the conditioned stimulus, the number of units responding in the first 4-8 ms to click increased to 23%. The mean magnitude of activity 4-8 ms alter presenting the click increased after conditioning but not after sensitization produced by backward pairing of the stimuli used for conditioning. After backward pairing only 6% of the units responded in the first 4-8 ms to click. The changes in activity after conditioning were accompanied by increases in neural excitability to intracellularly applied depolarizing current. In contrast with the changes in activity, the increases in neural excitability were also found after backward pairing. We conclude that short as well as long latency acoustic transmissions to click change in the dentate nucleus after conditioning, that changes in response to click are expressed in 4-8 ms responsive cells, and that many of these cells have different patterns of spike activity in response to click and hiss. The findings support the hypothesis that the dentate nucleus can play a significant role in short as well as long latency, adaptive acoustic transmission that can enhance the response to an acoustic signal used as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus.","Woody C.D., Wang X.F., Gruen E.",1998,Scopus,10.1016/S0006-8993(98)00017-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0032489934&doi=10.1016%2fS0006-8993%2898%2900017-1&partnerID=40&md5=e1cbf37b1e726155998e9f806fd825a4
"The responses of midbrain lateral line units of the goldfish, Carassius auratus, to objects moving in the water","Lateral line responses to hydrodynamic stimuli caused by small objects moving in the water were recorded extracellularly from single and ""few units"" in the midbrain torus semicircularis of the goldfish, Carassius auratus. All units (n = 59) increased their discharge rate when an object passed the fish laterally either from anterior to posterior or in the opposite direction. Different units could show different temporal response patterns. In 29 out of 49 units tested (59%) the number of spikes caused by an object moving from anterior to posterior along the side of the fish was significantly different from those caused by an object moving from posterior to anterior. Two units encoded motion direction by different temporal patterns of discharge. In general, discharge rates decreased when object distance was increased or when object speed was decreased. Changes in object size and shape did not affect the strength of unit responses as much as changes in object speed and distance. The data indicate that some midbrain lateral line units in the goldfish encode motion direction but are not tuned to other aspects of an object moving in the water. In this respect, the responses of units in the midbrain are similar to those reported for medullary units of goldfish. However, comparing midbrain with peripheral and medullary responses, it becomes clear that a substantial amount of neural computation has taken place and that there are distinct response types in the midbrain of Carassius which differ from the uniform peripheral and from medullary response patterns.","Wojtenek W., Mogdans J., Bleckmann H.",1998,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0040942620&partnerID=40&md5=76ddbcad82783a8afd8f5fd92653b11e

Locus coeruleus stimulation modulates the nociceptive response in parafascicular neurons: An analysis of descending and ascending pathways,"The nociceptive responses in parafascicular neurons (PF) were recorded and studied following electrical stimulation of locus coeruleus (LC) combined with intrathecal (IT) or intracerabroventricular (ICV) administration of phentolamine (Ph), an α-adrenoceptor antagonist. The results revealed the following. (1) Three different PF neuronal populations were observed according to their response pattern following noxious stimulation: nociceptive-on, nociceptive-off, and nonresponsive units. Only the nociceptive-on units were studied further. (2) The nociceptive discharges in majority of PF neurons (66/87) were inhibited by electrical stimulation of the LC. (3) The inhibitory effect of LC stimulation was prevented and even reversed by pretreatment of IT Ph (40 nmol) in 22 units, or by dorsolateral funiculi transection in 24 units tested. (4) The inhibitory effect of LC stimulation was strengthened by preadministration of ICV Ph (40 nmol) in 17 units tested. (5) ICV administration of norepinephrine (NE 30 nmol) resulted in PF neurons a biphasic response to nociceptive stimulation: an early brief inhibition and a late long-lasting facilitation. (6) Pretreatment of ICV Ph (40 nmol) prior to NE injection prevented the NE-induced biphasic response. The results suggest that stimulation of LC modulates the nociceptive response of PF neurons through both ascending and descending routes. These two diverse routes exert two different effects: a predominantly inhibitory role on the nociceptive transmission at the spinal cord level by descending NE-ergic fibers, and a facilitatory role on the responsiveness of PF to noxious inputs by ascending fibers.","Zhang C., Yang S.-W., Guo Y.-G., Qiao J.-T., Dafny N.",1997,Scopus,10.1016/S0361-9230(96)00262-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031024566&doi=10.1016%2fS0361-9230%2896%2900262-6&partnerID=40&md5=c16023615e1e898c3d08734b2ba78361
Primary afferent neurons innervating guinea pig dura,"We made recordings from filaments of guinea pig nasociliary nerve to study response properties of afferent axons innervating the anterior superior sagittal sinus and surrounding dura mater. We analyzed 38 units in 14 experiments. Units were initially located with the use of mechanical stimuli, and were then characterized by their conduction velocity and sensitivities to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. Single unit recordings revealed innervation of dura and superior sagittal sinus by slowly conducting axons, mostly in the unmyelinated range. The receptive fields were 1-30 mm2, and typically had one to three punctate spots of highest sensitivity. All units tested responded to topical application of chemical agents. Ninety-seven percent of units responded to 10-5 M capsaicin, 79% responded to a mixture of inflammatory mediators, and 37% responded to an acidic buffer (pH 5). These data underline the importance of chemical sensitivity in intracranial sensation. Heat and cold stimuli evoked responses in 56 and 41% of units tested, respectively. Although the response patterns during heating were typical of polymodal nociceptors innervating other tissues, the thresholds were lower than for other tissues (32.342°C). Cooling led to a phasic discharge, with thresholds between 25 and 32°C. Although units had different combinations of responses to mechanical, chemical, and thermal stimuli, when grouped by their sensitivities the groups did not differ regarding mechanical thresholds or presence of ongoing activity. This suggests that meningeal primary afferents are relatively homogeneous. Sensitivities of these units are in general consistent with nociceptors, although the thermal thresholds differ. These data provide the first detailed report of response properties of intracranial primary afferent units, likely to be involved in transmission of nociception and possibly mediation of intracranial pain.","Bove G.M., Moskowitz M.A.",1997,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1997.77.1.299,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031038062&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1997.77.1.299&partnerID=40&md5=f55ac3612d1d56759cf3c289bdef3825
"Comparison of accuracy and cost of disposable, nonmechanical pumps used for epidural infusions","Background and Objectives. Temporary epidural catheter pumps are used to infuse analgesics in patients with chronic intractable pain. Three brands of disposable, non-mechanical pumps adapted for epidural infusion were tested to determine their flow rate efficacy and their cost effectiveness. Methods. Three pump models were tested: the Baxter (2C1075), Homepump (H100020), and SurgiPEACE (SP500-24). Manufacturers of each unit claim to provide a constant 2-mL/h flow rate. A standard setup was used to simulate both the insertion of the catheter into the epidural space and the environmental conditions consistent with patient ambulation. Reservoirs were filled with water and allowed to infuse into a collection receptacle, and flow rates were measured hourly. Four trials were performed with four separate units and flow rate measurements were averaged to determine a flow rate pattern over the entire infusion period. Data were graphed as the percentage of expected flow rate (% of 2 mL/h) versus infusion time (hours), the 90-110% range being defined as acceptable. Results. All pumps initially infused at a rate above 110% for the first 3-6 hours, after which a steady decline in flow rate was observed. The Homepump produced a flow rate in the acceptable range for the greatest part of its infusion period (41%), followed by the SurgiPEACe (34%), and the Baxter unit (10.4%). The Baxter unit was also cumberstone to handle and therefore difficult to fill. The Homepump unit was easily handled but offered considerable resistance to filling, with partial loss of fluid. The SurgiPEACE unit was easy to handle and fill; however, in two of the units tested, an initial blockage was encountered, and manual patency of the connector and/or catheter had to be established. Conclusions. All three units deviated considerably from the claimed flow rate of 2-mL/h, both at the beginning and at the end of the infusion. Presumably, the decreasing flow rates are responsible for the diminishing pain relief often experienced by patients over the course of the infusion. The Homepump unit appeared to be the most cost-effective and the easiest to handle and maintained an acceptable infusion rate for the greatest percentage of the infusion period. The considerable cost benefit of using a nonmechanical disposable pump as opposed to a costly but more reliable computerized pump appears to warrant further product improvement and development.",Valente M.,1997,Scopus,10.1016/s1098-7339(06)80012-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031011608&doi=10.1016%2fs1098-7339%2806%2980012-x&partnerID=40&md5=a3b799e3232a2227f940732754ee2653
Quantitative measurement feasibility for 3D distributions of hydrodynamic quantities in the turbulent mixing zone of two gases,"In doing research on the turbulent mixing (TM) of two gases different in density, it is of great interest to study experimentally the 3D density distribution pattern of chemically non-reactive gases in the TM zone. For this purpose, noncontact and, particularly, optical techniques to obtain experimental data may be attractive. This article discusses the possibility of using pulsed laser interferometry in this application. Based on this technique, the experiment should result in the mixture density distribution integrated along the light path. Requirements for high-quality interference patterns have been analyzed in application to typical experimental conditions, to show that they may be produced with specific restrictions set on the mixture constitution. Generally, the TM zone has no symmetry. Therefore, the problem of reconstructing 3D density distributions (TDD) of gases can be solved by sufficiently providing many TM zone integral projections (or aspects). It is technically difficult and expensive to achieve this large number of aspects (N> 10). Therefore, it is essential that a reconstruction method be selected to allow the solution of the problem with the least possible number of aspects. Given that the experiment data are incomplete, the reconstruction methods that are based on the concept of maximum data entropy did well. Information a priori about the solution to be sought for an isobaric gas mixture is that its each constituent has invariable density. Thus, a functional data entropy can be defined that is similar to Fermi gas in statistical physics. An algorithm has been suggested for reconstruction as a modified maximum-bounded entropy procedure (Bashurin et al. 1995). This makes reasonable good reconstruction achievable even with as few aspects as N = 4. Experiments on the study of TM of a propane jet in air using a four-aspects laser interferometer were provided and reconstruction of propane concentration distribution was conducted. The results allow determination of the TM zone spectral characteristics.","Bashurin V.P., Bashurov V.V., Bogunenko Yu.D., Bondarenko G.A., Pletenev F.A., Starodubtsev V.A.",1997,Scopus,10.1017/s0263034600010764,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030719099&doi=10.1017%2fs0263034600010764&partnerID=40&md5=b9e639f5e41b19be4625b2460a3a8f38
Inability of rhesus monkey area V1 to discriminate between self-induced and externally induced retinal image slip,"Retinal image slip can result from an eye movement across a stationary object or alternatively from motion of the object while the eyes are stationary. The ability to discriminate between these two kinds of retinal image slip is necessary for the perception of a stable visual world. In order to determine if this ability is already present in monkey visual area V1, we asked if single V1 units are able to differentiate between externally and self-induced retinal image slip. Externally induced retinal image slip was realized in the 'object motion' condition (OMC) by moving a behaviourally irrelevant visual stimulus ('object': a bar or a large random dot pattern) across the receptive field while the monkey fixated a small, stationary target. Conversely, self-induced retinal image slip of comparable size was evoked in the 'ego motion' condition (EMC) by asking the monkey to pursue the target, moving at the speed of the object in the OMC, while the object was kept stationary, We recorded 221 units from visual area V1, 51 (23%) of them directionally selective, and compared their responses to self-induced and externally induced retinal image slip. Many of them seemed to give some preference to externally induced retinal image slip. However, on closer examination it became clear that this seeming preference could be attributed to the fact that oculomotor performance was less precise in the EMC than in the OMC, causing a larger deviation from the optimal retinal image trajectory in the EMC. We show that the impact of eye position errors can be eliminated by the use of a position-invariant stimulus, such as large-field random dot patterns. We then show that the impact of both eye position errors and deviation of eye velocity from target velocity in the EMC can be eliminated by moving the stimulus in a given OMC trial according to an inverted replica of the eye movement trajectory in the preceding EMC trial, guaranteeing identical retinal stimulation in the OMC and the EMC. If identical retinal stimulation was ensured, none of the V1 units tested was able to differentiate between externally and self-induced retinal image slip. We conclude that V1 does not contribute to the perception of a world which is stable despite eye movements.",Ilg U.J.,1996,Scopus,10.1111/j.1460-9568.1996.tb01283.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029974725&doi=10.1111%2fj.1460-9568.1996.tb01283.x&partnerID=40&md5=daaabfe968da902cb1de26ecacc2b1d3
Pulmonary function testing in the intensive care unit - Test selection and interpretation,"Background and purpose: Volume monitor is a small and portable electronic device used in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for ventilatory function monitoring. It displays tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (f), minute ventilation (MV), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). The method is still unstandardised. The aim of this study was the selection of reliable ventilatory tests and its proper interpretation for early detection of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI) in spontaneously breathing patients with acute pulmonary disease. Patients and methods: After ventilatory function testing threshold values were determined for each index that discriminated best 45 patients with ARI and 41 patients without ARI. Operating lest characteristics were calculated and analysed with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, in which the proportions of true positive and false positive results are plotted against each other for a number of threshold values of the index. Index accuracy was reflected by the shape and position of the curve in a co-ordinate system. Curves for test usefulness determination, helpful in test in interpretation, were constructed with data for positive and negative predictive value and pre-test estimate of the disorder likelihood. Results: Threshold values VT &lt; 300 ml, f &gt; 32 breath/min, f/VT &gt; 110 breath/min 1, FVC &lt; 1500 ml, FEV1 &lt; 900 ml are considered reliable. Breathing pattern parameters (VT, f, f/VT) showed high specificity (95, 90, 100%) but low sensitivity (51, 53, 60%) with many missed classifications (54, 57, 40%, mostly false negatives. Spirometric parameters (FVC, FEV1,) showed high sensitivity (91, 80% and specificity (88, 85%) with less missed classifications (21, 36%). Conclusions: FVC &lt; 1500 ml was the most accurate predictor of ARI existence in spontaneously breathing patients with acute pulmonary disease, although breathing pattern parameters should not be rejected for respiratory monitoring in ICU. Prospective studies for different patient populations and test purposes are needed. This study has shown simplicity and reliability of this method of standardisation.","Danjek B., Pilaš V., Danjek I.",1996,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029836837&partnerID=40&md5=0e01e7a03f6010a4871feff54cbc3bcd

The CHAM formalism analyzes and verifies various properties of a system under specification.

Hybrid DS/SFH-TDD Cellular System with Adaptive Hopping Pattern Control,"Hybrid direct sequence/slow frequency hopping-time division duplex (DS/SFH-TDD) multiple access system has some good features of each system. However it has a problem of hit between multiple users. If the designed frequency hopping patterns are inadequate, the quality of the multiple access system is degraded due to the frequent hit. In this paper, we propose an adaptive hopping pattern control system which is able to avoid the multiple access interference of hit. The proposed system decreases the influence of hit and increases the user capacity in the cell. And this adaptive hopping pattern control is applied to both single-cell and multi-cell systems. By computer simulation to evaluate the performance of this system, we found that this system is effective in increasing the multiple access capability. hybrid DS/SFH system.

Alteration of human cutaneous afferent discharges as the result of long-lasting vibration,"The unitary activities of slowly (15 SAI) and fast-adapting type I (12 FAI) skin mechanoreceptive afferent units innervating the anterior part of the human leg and foot were recorded by using the microneurographic method. The recordings were performed both at rest and on application of cutaneous stimuli of various intensities before and after exposure of the corresponding receptive fields to vibration (0.5 mm peak to peak, 100 pulses/s, 10 min). The results show that 11% of the units tested, which were previously silent, developed a bursting pattern of postvibratory activity, which lasted 12 min on average. This induced resting activity may account for the tingling sensations usually perceived after exposure to vibration. Furthermore, application of vibration to the cutaneous receptive fields impaired the response properties of the corresponding cutaneous fibers much more markedly in the case of the SAI than in the FAI units. More specifically, less than one-half of the FAI fibers tested showed a postvibratory depressed sensitivity to skin stroking applied at various velocities that persisted for only a few minutes, whereas the responses of all the SAI units to suprathreshold maintained skin indentations applied with increasing amplitudes decreased significantly for 20 min. These fairly durable changes in the transductive properties of the mechanoreceptive afferent units probably lead to an impairment of perceptual and sensorimotor processes and consequently may at least partly account for the alterations in sensorimotor performance that have been reported to occur in humans after exposure to vibration.","Ribot-Ciscar E., Roll J.P., Tardy-Gervet M.F., Harlay F.",1996,Scopus,10.1152/jappl.1996.80.5.1708,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029862888&doi=10.1152%2fjappl.1996.80.5.1708&partnerID=40&md5=9fa345615f7516f04ca154cd41f4877c
Is HIV screening being requested appropriately? The experience of a Victorian public health laboratory,"From the start of clinical testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody in 1985 until the end of June 1994, the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit tested 134 346 serum samples from 109 391 individuals, identifying 672 as infected. A suitable database, using coded identities, was established from the beginning. Because the sera came from a variety of clinical settings, it was possible to extract information about patterns of requests for tests and about the yield of seropositive cases. The data were able to highlight factors associated with high rates of positive tests that can be lost in amalgamated statewide data. The discovery of HIV-positive females was sporadic and there was a much lower detection rate than from testing males. While males were most commonly diagnosed through specialist venereology services, 61 per cent of diagnoses in females were through nonspecialised practices, often those without previous experience in diagnosis and management of HIV infection. Despite some individual exceptions, the requesting of HIV tests appears generally to have been justifiable (particularly in view of the direction of official preventive campaigns) and not profligate. Overall, where practice was unsatisfactory, this lay less in thoughtless ordering of tests than in failing to include with the specimen the elementary, but vital, epidemiological information requested.","Darlington R., Thompson S.C., Forsyth J.R.L.",1996,Scopus,10.1111/j.1467-842X.1996.tb01024.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029816687&doi=10.1111%2fj.1467-842X.1996.tb01024.x&partnerID=40&md5=79e0826e5cebba716cef8f89e2908866
MMIC radar chip for use in air-to-air missile fuzing applications,"The next generation of air-to-air missiles will require Target Detecting Devices (TDD) that must utilize directional target sensing to optimize weapon effectiveness.

Synchronization techniques for a frequency-hopped wireless transceiver,"The implementation of robust synchronization algorithms and architectures for master-slave configured frequency-hopped radios with frequency-shifted keying (FSK) modulation is described. The synchronization scheme, both acquisition and tracking, is based on a simple time division duplexing (TDD) frame structure, which consists of a pilot tone, a frame ID (Word Sync), and actual data. The acquisition process is accomplished by means of frame synchronization, based on coarse energy detection of the received signal and the pattern matching of a 21-digit Barker code. The proposed scheme for synchronous-access frequency-hopped transceivers is much simpler than a parallel search method based on parallel matched filters, and relatively faster compared to a PN acquisition scheme based on serial search. Although FSK signals are detected noncoherently, a frequency tracking loop is required to compensate for the carrier frequency offset between the transmitter and receiver. The receiver also needs a time tracking loop to recover the clock from the received data. Both loops use a digital phase-locked loop architecture with programmable loop bandwidths.","Min Jonathan, Samueli Henry",1996,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029707990&partnerID=40&md5=e745780f9605fd3f1ab08a9172ee91da

Taste responses in neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract that do and do not project to the parabrachial pons,"1. Mechanisms of neural coding of gustatory stimuli were studied in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the first relay in the neural pathway for gustation, in anesthetized rats. Taste-responsive NTS units were identified as 'relay' or 'nonrelay' based on the electrophysiological response to electrical pulses delivered to the parabrachial nucleus of the pons (PbN), the second relay in the neural pathway for gustation. Coding mechanisms in each group were analyzed separately. 2.Taste responses to sapid solutions of NaCl (0.1 M), HCl (0.01 M), quinine HCl (0.01 M), sucrose (0.5 M) and Na-saccharin (0.004 M) were recorded in single units in the NTS. After gustatory stimulation, electrophysiological responses to electrical stimulation of the taste-responsive part of the ipsilateral PbN were recorded. A 0.2-ms pulse was delivered at 75-250 μA at a rates of 1, 25, 50 and 100 pps through a bipolar stainless steel electrode. An antidromic response was defined as a time-locked spike that occurred at a fixed latency after PbN stimulation that followed high stimulation frequencies. A collision test also was performed. 3. Of 42 taste-responsive NTS units, 19 (45%) were relay units, 22 (52%) were nonrelay and 1 unit was activated orthodromically by PbN stimulation. Latencies of evoked spikes ranged from 1.75 to 4.0 ms 2.1 ± 0.2 ms (mean ± SE, median, 1.75 ms). 4. Examination of general response characteristics revealed few differences among relay and nonrelay units. The mean response rates produced by taste stimuli were similar in relay and nonrelay units, with the exception of saccharin, which evoked a significantly larger response in relay units compared with nonrelay units. Classification of units based on their best, i.e., most effective, stimulus showed that most units in both groups were either NaCl- or HCl-best. Relay units were most frequently HCl-best; non relay units were most frequently NaCl-best. 5. Both relay and nonrelay units were broadly responsive across the taste stimuli that were tested. Almost all units in both groups responded to more than one taste stimulus; however, significantly more relay units responded to three or more of the representatives of the four basic taste qualities (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter). The uncertainty measure, an index of the breadth of tuning, was not different in relay and nonrelay units. 6. The labeled line index also was calculated to assess the extent to which pairwise comparisons of taste stimuli by the associated across unit patterns of response were accomplished by a labeled line code, where separate subsets of units respond to each stimulus of a pair, or by a frequency code, where both stimuli evoke responses in the same subset of units, albeit with different magnitudes. Results suggested that pairwise comparisons of taste stimuli among relay units were characterized predominatly by labeled line types of codes but showed more evidence of frequency codes among nonrelay units. 7. Across unit patterns of response were analyzed using a vector space analysis. In this approach, the response of each unit to a given stimulus is treated as a coordinate in n-dimensional space, where n is the number of units tested. The vector defined by the responses of the sample of units literally represents the across unit pattern evoked by a taste stimulus. When the relationships among these vectors were analyzed for NTS units, results suggested that, for relay units, the across unit patterns associated with palatable stimuli, i.e., NaCl and sucrose, were more similar to each other than they were to the across unit patterns produced by unpalatable stimuli, i.e., HCl and quinine. The converse was also true. In contrast to previous reports that proposed that the NTS preferentially conveys information about hedonically positive stimuli to the PbN from the NTS may enhance the differences between palatable and unpalatable stimuli to more rostral structures.","Monroe s., Di Lorenzo P.M.",1995,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1995.74.1.249,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029080255&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1995.74.1.249&partnerID=40&md5=51e1013494f6fdf947ae94d9fc687d76
Temporal Coding of Amplitude and Frequency Modulation in the Rat Auditory Cortex,"The rat primary auditory cortex was explored for neuronal responses to pure tones and sinusoidally amplitude‐modulated (SAM) and frequency‐modulated (SFM) stimuli. Units showed phase‐locked responses to SAM stimulation (55%) and SFM stimulation (80%), with modulation frequencies up to 18 Hz. Tuning characteristics to the modulation frequency were mainly band‐pass with best modulation frequencies (BMFs) between 4 and 15 Hz. Units with synchronized activity to SFM stimulation showed three response types with respect to the direction of the frequency modulation: 52% were selective to the upward direction, 30% to the downward direction, and 18% had no preference. Triangular frequency modulations were used to test if units were tuned to specific modulation frequencies or to specific rates of frequency change. In the vast majority of units tested the response characteristics were strongly influenced by varying the modulation frequency, whereas varying the rate of frequency change had little effect in the stimulus range used. Units that showed phase‐locked responses to SAM and SFM stimulation had similar activity patterns in response to both types of stimuli. BMFs for SAM and SFM stimulation were significantly correlated. Intrinsic oscillations of up to 20 Hz could be seen in the spontaneous activity and after the stimuli independent of the stimulus type. Oscillation frequencies were significantly correlated with the BMFs of the respective units. The results are discussed in terms of a mechanism for periodicity detection based on a temporal code. This could be important for the recognition of complex acoustic signals. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Time division duplex transmission of direct sequence spread spectrum signals in multipath channels,"The Time Division Duplex (TDD) method of transmission of Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DS-SS) signals was recommended for systems operating in multipath channels. TDD systems are considered simpler, can assist efficient power control, consume less power and operable with simpler mobile unit receivers. Both reverse and forward links utilize the same frequency band, hence, having a highly correlated fading pattern in the proposed TDD mode. In systems where multipaths are made artificially by employing multiple antennas, the properties of the channel as perceived by the antennas can be estimated at base station.

Evaluation of channel allocation with distributed control scheme for street microcellular systems,"Distributed control is indispensable to any personal communication service. However, distributed control makes it difficult to obtain the required frequency bandwidth considering the offered traffic and interference because there is no definite relationship between the base stations and the channels that they use. This paper proposes the virtual frequency reuse pattern, namely a virtual cluster size. The virtual cluster size gives the number of required control channels on a TDMA frame, assuming that once selected, the base station permanently uses the same control channel. The upper bound and the lower bound of the virtual cluster size are obtained theoretically and the practical virtual cluster size is obtained by computer simulations. Traffic channel assignment by dynamic channel allocation is designed for street microcellular systems as well. Both synchronized and asynchronized TDMA frames between base stations are discussed in this study. The optimum radio access method (TDMA/TDD or FDD) following all system conditions is reported in this paper.","Takanashi Hitoshi, Tanaka Toshiaki",1994,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028705525&partnerID=40&md5=eee093de5e53b8edcc475f57b6d0661c
Dosimetric problems at low monitor unit settings for scanned and scattering foil electron beams,"Electron beam dosimetry at low monitor unit (MU) settings is important for dosimetric applications. Dose linearity, beam flatness, and beam energies were studied at low MU settings with various dose rates for different types of linear accelerators. It is observed that for the scattering foil units, the dose/MU is a smooth function of MU for all beam energies. Discrepancies in dose/MU are highest at the lowest MU. Significant variation (5%-245%) in dose linearity is observed among various linear accelerators at low MU settings. Dose rate has no effect on the dose linearity for all energies for the scattering foil units tested. On the contrary, for the scanned beam, there is no predictable pattern as dose/MU is random in nature and varies with time and beam energy. The maximum dosimetric error is observed for the highest energy beam where the beam width is most narrow. Using film, the beam uniformity was noticed to be very poor at low MU and high energy for scanned beams. The beam uniformity and dose linearity are random at low MU due to the random nature of the scan cycle. Under the adverse conditions, the deviation in dosimetric parameters was observed up to 200 MU. © 1994, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Spectral efficiency improvement by base station antenna pattern control for land mobile cellular systems,"This paper proposes using an adaptive array in a base station for signal reception and transmission in order to increase the spectral efficiency without decreasing the cell radius. The adaptive array controls the directivity pattern of the base station to reduce co-channel interference during reception; the same array pattern is applied during transmission to prevent unnecessary illumination. Computer simulation results show that the cluster size can be reduced to one with time division duplexing (TDD), indicating that we can reuse the same frequency group at all cells. Thus, the improvement in spectral efficiency is as much as 16 fold that of an omni-antenna. Moreover, load sharing, which is expected to improve the channel utilization for unbalanced load situations, is available by cell overlapping. Frequency division duplexing (FDD) requires a weight adjust function to be applied for transmission since the difference in frequency between signal reception and transmission causes null positioning error. However, simple LMS-adjusting can provide a cluster size of one as well as cell overlapping when the frequency deference is 5%.",Ohgane Takeo,1994,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028425188&partnerID=40&md5=37026f2185b589b0fa1c045d98a49253
Participation of the caudal fastigial nucleus in smooth-pursuit eye movements. I. Neuronal activity,"1. We recorded single-unit activity from neurons of an output of the cerebellum, the fastigial nucleus, in two rhesus macaques while the monkeys tracked small moving targets with their eyes. Many neurons in the caudal part of the fastigial nucleus exhibited a modulation in their discharge rates when smooth-pursuit eye movements were elicited by either sinusoidal or step-ramp motions of a small target. 2. The pursuit direction that elicited the most vigorous modulation in unit firing to sinusoidal target motion could be horizontal, vertical, or oblique. Most often, the preferred direction was in the contralateral and/or downward direction (50 of 69 neurons) or in the ipsilateral and/or upward direction (13 of 69). 3. For units whose preferred smooth-pursuit directions were either contralateral/downward or ipsilateral/upward during sinusoidal pursuit, peak firing as measured by the phase shift of periodic modulation at 0.5-0.8 Hz occurred near the time of peak velocity. The discharge of 80% of the neurons with contralateral/downward preferred directions preceded eye velocity by an average of -27°; thus these neurons discharged maximally during eye acceleration. In contrast, neurons with ipsilateral/upward preferred directions lagged peak velocity by an average of +10.5° and therefore discharged during eye deceleration. 4. The average eye velocity sensitivity for sinusoidal pursuit between 0.5 and 0.8 Hz was 0.83 ± 0.57 (SD) spikes/s per °/s. We also tested 36 units during pursuit at a variety of frequencies in their preferred directions and found that firing rates increased monotonically with peak eye velocity. However, the firing rate saturated at velocities ranging from 20 to 60°/s for different units. 5. When a monkey tracked a step-ramp target motion, three discharge patterns emerged in the 27 units tested. Just over half of the units discharged a burst of spikes that preceded (average lead of 27.4 ± 17 ms) and lasted throughout the initial third of the eye acceleration; the burst was followed by a subsequent steady firing that continued after the eye had accelerated to its steady velocity. Fewer neurons discharged a burst that began late in the acceleration and was followed by steady firing. Occasional neurons showed only a gradual increase in firing rate during acceleration followed by a steady discharge. 6. Thirty of the 31 fastigial smooth-pursuit units tested also were modulated during sinusoidal yaw and/or pitch oscillations while the animals fixated a spot that rotated with them. Unlike floccular Purkinje cells, fastigial smooth- pursuit neurons often had unequal sensitivities to eye and head velocity. Approximately half had greater sensitivities to head velocity and half to eye velocity. 7. Our data suggest that the caudal fastigial nucleus may play a prominent role both in the initial acceleration of smooth pursuit and possibly in its maintenance. The existence in this same area of saccade- related neurons whose discharge is related to contralateral acceleration and ipsilateral deceleration suggests that the caudal fastigial nucleus may have a global role in the acceleration of all conjugate eye movements. In the DISCUSSION section we speculate about how the fastigial nucleus may exert this influence and how it may cooperate with the flocculus in the generation of pursuit eye movements.","Fuchs A.F., Robinson F.R., Straube A.",1994,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1994.72.6.2714,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028148296&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1994.72.6.2714&partnerID=40&md5=a7e26aa47da46d52016f5db966879a81
Neuropharmacology of the nucleus accumbens: Systemic morphine effects on single-unit responses evoked by ventral pallidum stimulation,"Extracellular recordings of neurons in the nucleus accumbens septi of anesthetized rats have previously shown systemic opiates to have mixed effects on rates of unit activity. However, these effects become more predictable as nucleus accumbens septi neurons are functionally categorized by their responses to afferent stimulation. In the present study, the effects of systemic opiates on individual nucleus accumbens septi neurons categorized by their response patterns to ventral pallidum stimulation were examined. Across all nucleus accumbens septi units tested, these experiments showed that morphine either inhibited (42%, n = 91), excited (15%, n = 32) or had no effect (43%, n = 93) on these unit responses. Further experiments were conducted in which nucleus accumbens septi neurons were categorized on the basis of their response patterns to concurrent fimbria and ventral pallidum stimulation. In these studies, if the neuron was orthodromically evoked to respond by both fimbria stimulation and ventral pallidum stimulation, the neurons' responses to ventral pallidum stimulation (but not their fimbria-evoked responses) were consistently inhibited by morphine. In contrast, nucleus accumbens septi unit responses that were orthodromically activated by ventral pallidum stimulation but unaffected by fimbria stimulation were consistently unaffected by morphine. The major observation of this work is that the effect of systemically administered morphine on individual nucleus accumbens septi neurons can be predicted by that neuron's evoked responses to stimulation of different efferent and afferent circuits. Since these studies involve systemic administration of morphine, the results do not elucidate site of action. However, these results do contribute to the understanding of net opiate effects at a systems level and therefore are relevant to the consequences of such drugs in self-administration paradigms. © 1994.","Hakan R.L., Eyl C., Henriksen S.J.",1994,Scopus,10.1016/0306-4522(94)90009-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028051784&doi=10.1016%2f0306-4522%2894%2990009-4&partnerID=40&md5=74fcd23e8cfcdbe6bb63acc0be3b6d57
The visual response properties of neurons in the nucleus of the basal optic root of the northern saw-whet owl (aegolius acadicus),"The nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR) in birds is a component of the accessory optic system (AOS) which is involved in the analysis of visual flowfields normally resulting from self-motion. Using standard extracellular techniques, we recorded from 81 single-unit and multi-unit clusters in the nBOR of the northern saw-whct owl, Aegolius acadicus, an avian species that has a visual system with frontal emphasis. These cells responded best to large patterns of random dots moving either upward (52%). downward (31%) or nasal to temporal (N-T; contralateral visual field; 15%). Only 2 units (2%) preferred temporal to nasal motion. ‘Up’ units were found in the dorsal portion of the nucleus whereas ‘Down’ units were located more ventrally. The N-T units were found in both the lateral margin of the nucleus and ventral to the Down units in the lateral half of the nucleus. About half of the units tested (10/19) responded to stimulation of the ipsilateral as well as the contralateral eye. For all but one cell, the direction preference of both eyes was the same in visual space. When compared with previous studies of pigeons (Columha livia) and chickens (Gallus domesticus), these findings reveal that the nBOR in all three avian species have important similarities with respect to direction preference and functional compartmentalization. Furthermore, the high proportion of binocular neurons found in the nBOR of the saw-whet owl is similar to the condition generally reported in frontal eyed mammals and hence may reflect adaptation. © 1994 S.

Role of the caudal fastigial nucleus in saccade generation. I. Neuronal discharge patterns,"1. The effects of lesions in both human and nonhuman primates have implicated the cerebellum in the control of rapid eye movements, i.e., saccades. To examine the neural substrate of this control, we recorded the discharge patterns of cerebellar output cells in the fastigial nucleus while monkeys tracked a small, jumping spot of light. 2. In the caudal fastigial nucleus, neurons discharged for saccades in one or several directions. All exhibited a burst. Some also exhibited a saccade-related pause in firing either before or after saccades greater than ~3-5°. Thirty-seven percent discharged only a burst, 44% also exhibited a pause before bursts in certain directions, and 19% also paused after the saccade-related burst in certain directions. Although many cells discharged steadily during intersaccadic intervals, few exhibited a robust relation between firing rate and eye position. 3. As a measure of directional selectivity, we plotted the burst lead time as a function of saccade direction for saccades of similar (10°) radial amplitudes. Of 20 neurons tested, 17 burst earliest for contralateral saccades and 1 for upward saccades; 2 others showed little dependence on direction. Of 19 additional units tested only in the horizontal direction, 18 burst earlier for contralateral saccades. 4. For contralateral saccades the burst preceded saccades of all sizes by at least 7.7 ms on average. For ipsilateral saccades, the burst preceded small saccades by an average of 10.3 ms. However, as ipsilateral saccade size increased, the burst began later and later relative to saccade onset so that, on average, it always occurred after the onset of 20° saccades but well before the saccade ended. 5. Many fastigial saccade-related units showed increases in the number of spikes with saccade size and in burst duration with saccade duration in one or more directions. For either relation the highest average correlation coefficients ranged from 0.6 to 0.65. In general, the average correlation coefficients and slopes for either relation were slightly larger for contralateral saccades. Pure burst neurons did not display better average correlations than neurons that also paused. For neurons that also paused either before or after saccades, there was a weak tendency for pause duration to increase with the duration of larger saccades. 6. We tested the effect of eye position on unit discharge in 13 cells by requiring the monkey to make 10° ipsilateral and contralateral saccades from a variety of starting positions. Eight of the neurons exhibited clear qualitative differences in either the burst characteristics, the presence of an accompanying pause, or the intersaccadic steady firing rate for different starting positions. However, only 2 of the 13 exhibited at least 1 correlation coefficient between burst parameters and starting position of 0.8 or more; 7 additional cells had at least 1 coefficient in excess of 0.4. The correlations with starting position did not improve when we sorted saccades into centrifugal and centripetal movements. 7. The saccade-related discharge of fastigial neurons was anything but machinelike. For some units, saccades of the same size and starting position were accompanied by bursts of widely differing frequencies and durations. In addition, alertness and/or attention appeared to affect the saccadic responses. 8. Nevertheless, our data suggest that the fastigial nucleus is involved in helping to accelerate contralateral saccades and in helping to decelerate ipsilateral ones. If this is true, lesions of the fastigial nucleus should cause contralateral saccades to become hypometric and ipsilateral saccades to become hypermetric. The pharmacological inactivations of the fastigial nucleus reported in the companion paper produced just such deficits.","Fuchs A.F., Robinson F.R., Straube A.",1993,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1993.70.5.1723,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027372453&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1993.70.5.1723&partnerID=40&md5=2e7ef68ed9f9dd90d35b753d0ef6d839
A comparison of the dentine‐removing characteristics of two endosonic units,"The purpose of this study was to compare the dentine‐removing characteristics of size 25 K‐files activated by the Cavi‐Endo and Piezon‐Endo units. The influence of power‐setting, direction of file oscillation, interfacial force and operator‐assisted movement were studied. Filing was performed on flat surfaces of dentine and impressions of the instrumented surfaces revealed characteristic patterns of dentine removal corresponding to the area of contact with the file which was quantified using a Reflex microscope. Differences in dentine removal as affected by the power output of the two systems were only apparent when the maximum power‐setting on the Cavi‐Endo was compared with the maximum recommended for root canal preparation on the Piezon‐Endo. The Cavi‐Endo removed significantly more dentine than the Piezon‐Endo. When operator‐assisted movement of the file was superimposed, both systems removed significantly more dentine than without assisted filing. However, the Piezon‐Endo now removed significantly more dentine than the Cavi‐Endo. This difference was more apparent when the file oscillated perpendicular to the dentine surface, compared with oscillation parallel to the substrate. An increase in the interfacial force from 30 g to 60 g resulted in a greater reduction in dentine removal by the Cavi‐Endo compared with the Piezon‐Endo. Thus, at a 30 g interfacial force there were insignificant differences between the endosonic units but at 60 g, the Piezon‐Endo removed significantly more dentine than the Cavi‐Endo. The dentine‐removing characteristics of the two endosonic units tested are very different under certain conditions. These findings may have important clinical implications.

Shapes of independent atoms and chemical deformation densities of second-row molecules,"It is suggested that the information about chemical bonding contained in the total electron density distribution should be split into three parts. First, the standard crystallographic parameters (i.e. the atomic positions which are most appropriate for bond formation); these give rise to the standard ""total difference density"" (TDD). Second, the shapes of degenerate atomic ground states appropriate for optimal interatomic interactions, giving rise to the novel ""chemical deformation density"" (CDD). Third, the genuine chemical deformation of the atoms in the molecule or crystal. This approach was applied to more than 40 molecules consisting mainly of second-row atoms (lithium to fluorine) and hydrogen. Contrary to the standard TDD, the novel CDD gives a very consistent pattern of covalent bond and lone pair densities, even for electron-rich atoms. The atomic shape parameters comprise valence atomic orbital directions and populations. They correlate very well with the type of bonding of the atoms in the molecule. © 1992.","Schwarz W.H.E., Lin H.L., Irle S., Niu J.E.",1992,Scopus,10.1016/0166-1280(92)85023-E,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000659508&doi=10.1016%2f0166-1280%2892%2985023-E&partnerID=40&md5=99fd04070da84953dedea716662c9f03
Mutagenicity of organic emissions from unvented kerosene heaters in a chamber study,"A study was conducted to assess the mutagenicity of semivolatile organics and particle-bound organics emitted from unvented kerosene space heaters. The units tested included a well-tuned radiant heater and a maltuned convective heater. The tests were conducted in a 27-m3 chamber with a prescribed on/off heater usage pattern. The organic emissions were collected on Teflon-coated glass filters backed by XAD-2 resin. The dichloromethane-extractable organics from both the filters and the XAD were analyzed for nitropolycyclic hydrocarbons using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and were bioassayed for mutagenicity in microsuspension assays using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 with and without S9 and TA98NR (a nitroreductase-deficient strain) without S9. The results showed that both the semivo-latile and particle-bound organics emitted from the kerosene heaters were mutagenic, and the presence of nitropolycyclic hydrocarbons in these organic emissions substan-tiated these findings. © 1988 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation.","Mumford J.L., Lewtas J., Williams K., Tucker W.G.",1992,Scopus,10.1080/15287399209531629,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026694350&doi=10.1080%2f15287399209531629&partnerID=40&md5=d0ea2cd2810d358fdebe4440da658f65
Response patterns and postspike effects of peripheral afferents in dorsal root ganglia of behaving monkeys,"The activity of single afferent units was recorded in cervical dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in two macaque monkeys as they generated alternating flexion and extension torques about the wrist during a step-tracking task. During these isometric and auxotonic muscle contractions, electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded with electrode pairs in up to 12 independent forearm muscles. Spike-triggered averages (STAs) of rectified EMG activity were used to identify afferents that were associated with correlated facilitation of active muscles. Our aim was to find peripheral afferents producing postspike effects in muscles and to compare their properties with those of corticomotoneuronal (CM) and rubromotoneuronal (RM) cells previously obtained under identical behavioral conditions. We documented the timing, magnitude and distribution of their postspike facilitation (PSF) of forearm muscles and investigated the response properties of task-related units. Of 125 afferent units tested with STAs, 68 showed PSF of EMG activity in at least one muscle. Fifty-nine DRG units provided sufficiently long recordings to generate averages with ≥2,000 triggers, the minimum number considered to demonstrate reliable effects. Of these 59 units, 29 (49%) were associated with facilitation of forearm muscle activity. Many STAs showed a gradual increase in EMG activity starting before or near the afferent trigger spike; often superimposed on this broad facilitation was a sharply rising PSF starting at a longer latency. The earliest poststimulus facilitation evoked by single microstimuli delivered in DRG occurred in stimulus-triggered averages at a latency of 3.5 ms. In STAs the broad facilitation beginning at latencies shorter than the responses to electrical stimulation was attributed to synchronous discharges in other afferent units. The sharper postspike EMG increases occurring with latencies of ≥3.5 ms were identified as PSF produced by the afferent. The PSF parameters documented in this study were measured after subtracting the effects of synchrony facilitation. PSF of EMG activity began at a mean latency of 5.8 ± 0.3 (SE) ms and peaked at a mean latency of 7.5 ± 0.3 (SE) ms. In previous studies, the PSFs from CM and RM cells had mean onset latencies of 6.3 and 5.6 ms, respectively, and mean peak latencies of 10.2 and 9.1 ms. A measure of the PSF amplitude is the mean percent increase (MPI), defined as the increase of the PSF above its base measured as a percentage of the prespike baseline mean. Muscles facilitated by the 29 afferent units that produced PSF had an average MPI of 4.6 ± 0.3% (SE). This is smaller than the MPIs reported for RM (5.1%) and CM (7.0%) cells (which were not similarly corrected for possible synchrony facilitations). Units that facilitated EMG activity usually facilitated a subset of the coactivated muscles. The 29 adequately tested afferents facilitated an average of 46% of the synergistically coactivated muscles. This is comparable to the percentage of muscles facilitated by CM (40%) and RM (50%) cells. The average number of muscles facilitated per afferent was 2.6. The results reveal some salient differences between the discharge properties of DRG afferents and supraspinal premotoneuronal (PreM) cells in motor cortex and red nucleus. All three PreM populations include tonic, phasic-tonic, and phasic cells but in significantly different proportions. The PreM afferents were typically active only with their target muscles, like CM cells and unlike RM cells. The hypothesis that these PreM afferents arose from muscle spindles is supported by their short-latency PSF, their responses to perturbations, and their onset before activity of their target muscles; the early activation would further suggest that γ-motoneurons can activate spindles before α-motoneurons become active.","Flament D., Fortier P.A., Fetz E.E.",1992,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1992.67.4.875,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026689019&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1992.67.4.875&partnerID=40&md5=b70620556a8837c95bce826c6edfdf2d
Sucking Patterns of Neonates During Bottle Feeding: Comparison of Different Nipple Units,"The present study was designed to compare the sucking pattern of term and preterm infants during bottle feeding with different types of nipple units (Enfamil single-hole nipple units for term and preterm infants and SMA Nuk nipple units). In addition, the sucking pattern of term neonates during a feeding regimen commonly used in many feeding studies was evaluated (reservoir nipple system). In this system milk flows from a reservoir through a tube and depends on the sucking pressure generated by the infant. Only the Enfamil single-hole nipple units for term and preterm infants were compared in preterm infants. No significant difference in sucking frequency was observed in term neonates with different types of nipple units. Although the mean sucking pressures generated tended to be less among nipple units with higher flow, these differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, no significant difference in total sucking or feeding time was observed among the three nipple units tested. Sucking pressures generated by term infants were significantly less when milk flow was increased markedly utilizing the reservoir system. In preterm infants no differences in sucking frequency, sucking pressure, mean flow, or total feeding time were observed when sucking patterns with term and preterm nipple units were compared. Implications of these findings in feeding neonates are discussed. © 1992, by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

Spike trains from single motor units in human parasternal intercostal muscles,"Recordings of single motor unit activity were obtained from parasternal intercostal muscles of normal humans during quiet breathing. Spike trains from 52 individual motor units were analyzed. All these units were low threshold ones, recruited at low inspired volumes and therefore at low tension thresholds. Mean frequency of firing at onset was 7.8 Hz and mean increase in frequency through the breath was 3.6 Hz. Onset and peak frequencies were positively correlated with inspiratory flow rate. Alternation of interspike intervals between long and short was found in the spike trains of 6 of 13 units tested and this occurred at frequencies of 6-12/s. Doublet discharges at the beginnings of spike trains were seen during voluntary neck flexion but never in quiet breathing or voluntary deep breaths.

An experimental study on software structural testing: Deterministic versus random input generation,"The fault revealing power of different test patterns derived from ten structural test criteria currently referred to in unit testing is investigated. Experiments performed on four programs that are pieces of a real-life software system from the nuclear field are reported. Three test input generation techniques are studied: (1) deterministic choice, (2) random selection based on an input probability distribution determined according to the adopted structural test criterion, and (3) random selection from a uniform distribution on the input domain. Mutation analysis is used to assess the test set efficiency with respect to error detection. The experimental results involve a total of 2914 mutants. They show that structural statistical testing, which exhibits the highest mutation scores, leaving alive only six from 2816 nonequivalent mutants within short testing times, is the most efficient.

Electrophysiological properties of neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats,"Single unit activities were recorded from the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVL) of pentobarbital-anesthetized normotensive Wistak Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Throughout the recording period, arterial blood pressures of WKY (mean arterial pressure, MAP = 103.1 mm Hg) and SHR (MAP = 159.2 mm Hg) remained stable at the respective basal levels. The units recorded in this study were all spontaneously active and cardiac-locked. Two types of discharge patterns, namely single and double discharges, were identified. These single and double discharge units were found to distribute randomly in RVL. In WKY, 92.6% of RVL neurons exhibited single discharges whereas in SHR, the majority (57%) of RVL neurons exhibited double discharges. The mean firing rate of single discharge units in RVL of SHR was significantly higher than that of WKY, whereas the mean firing rate of double discharge units in WKY was similar to that of SHR. About half of the units studied were also tested for antidromic collision; all units tested could be antidromically activated from the intermediolateral column (IML) of the thoracic spinal cord and the lowest threshold sites were consistently localized within IML. In both groups of rats, the axonal conduction velocity of RVL neurons showed a bimodal distribution viz. the fast and slow conducting axons. The mean conduction velocities of each of these two groups of neurons in WKY and SHR were similar. Most of the double discharge units in WKY and SHR belonged to the fast conducting type. In comparison with WKY, the present findings in SHR demonstrated that the majority of RVL units exhibited double discharge pattern with a fast conduction velocity, and the remaining RVL units showed single discharge pattern with a higher firing rate and regularity. These properties of RVL neurons may probably contribute to the enhanced sympathetic outflow from RVL of SHR and in turn account for the higher BP observed in SHR. © 1991.","Chan R.K.W., Chan Y.S., Wong T.M.",1991,Scopus,10.1016/0006-8993(91)90607-W,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025797392&doi=10.1016%2f0006-8993%2891%2990607-W&partnerID=40&md5=2ab91ca2c0629a5cba6ddc69c6c67870
Extraretinal Representations In Area V4 In The Macaque Monkey,"Several neurophysiological studies have shown that the visual cerebral cortex of macaque monkeys performing delayed match-to-sample tasks contains individual neurons whose levels of activity depend on the sample the animal is required to remember. Haenny et al. (1988) reported that the activity of neurons in area V4 of monkeys performing an orientation matching task depends on the orientation for which the animal is searching. It was proposed that these neurons contribute to a representation of the orientation being sought. We have further characterized these neurons by recording visual responses from individual neurons during multiple behavioral tasks. Animals were trained to perform an orientation match-to-sample task using either a visual or a tactile orientation sample. In a set of 89 neurons examined using both types of sample, 25% showed statistically significant effects of sample orientation regardless of whether the sample was visual or tactile. Most of these preferred the same sample orientation in both conditions. These results allow us to specify the nature of the information signaled by these neurons more precisely than has previously been possible. For 193 units tested using one of the matching tasks, responses were also recorded while the animal performed a simple fixation task. In this task the animal was not required to attend to the visual stimuli that were presented. A few neurons that were responsive during the matching task were silent during fixation, but a comparable number was much more responsive during fixation. Across the whole population there was no systematic change in either responsivity or selectivity for orientation under the two conditions. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

N-Methyl-d-aspartate-induced oscillations in excitatory afferent neurotransmission in the guinea pig cochlea,"With the aid of microiontophoretic techniques we tested the action of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and an NMDA antagonist in the dendritic region of inner hair cell afferent fibers. In the majority of units tested NMDA enhanced the spontaneous firing rate. Furthermore, the activation of NMDA receptors triggered unusual depolarization patterns: (1) slow-frequency oscillation with a periodicity of about 3/min; (2) a fast oscillatory pattern of burst firing with a rhythmic interburst frequency of about 2/s. These findings provide evidence for NMDA receptor properties in the cochlea similar to those of analog channels in the central nervous system. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.","Felix D., Ehrenberger K.",1991,Scopus,10.1007/BF00627627,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026095674&doi=10.1007%2fBF00627627&partnerID=40&md5=26fe1886e568591943643b870708f2b5
Patterns of unit activity in the rostral thalamus of cats related to short-latency discrimination between different auditory stimuli,"Short-latency auditory-responsive units were found in the rostral thalamus of cats during performance of conditioned eyeblink responses (CRs) elicited discriminatively by a forward-paired, 70-dB-click conditioned stimulus (CS) as opposed to a backward-paired, 70-dB-hiss discriminative stimulus (DS). Discharges in response to the CS or DS were found in 57% of 138 units tested. Forty-one percent of units responding to the CS did so at latencies of <40 msec. After conditioning a discriminative CR to click CS, an increase in the ratio of CS-evoked activity to baseline activity was found relative to that before conditioning. This increase was attributable, in part, to a decrease in baseline activity and, in part, to an increase in the magnitude of response to the CS. These responses preceded early components of the electromyographically measured motor responses with latencies sufficient to contribute to initiation of the movement. After acquisition of the CR, the proportion of CS responsive units also increased. We conclude that this area of the thalamus, a region thought to support thalamocortical reverberatory activity, also functions to transmit short-latency auditory signals. Our evidence further suggests that this region may participate in the elicitation of conditioned responses by specific auditory stimuli and in discrimination between auditory stimuli of different significance.","Woody C.D., Gruen E., Melamed O., Chizhevsky V.",1991,Scopus,10.1523/jneurosci.11-01-00048.1991,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026012224&doi=10.1523%2fjneurosci.11-01-00048.1991&partnerID=40&md5=ccb2361bc323199fb35dd227ab994425
Binaural masking level difference effects in single units of the guinea pig inferior colliculus,"We have studied the masking effects of a binaurally presented noise on the responses to binaural signals recorded from low-frequency cells in the inferior colliculus of the guinea pig. The spike rates to the masker and signal + masker were compared to quantify masking at different interaural time delays of the noise. The signal was a 50-ms tone burst at best frequency or a 50-ms segment of a synthetic vowel, presented at the best interaural delay of the unit tested. At each noise masker delay, the noise level was adjusted to obtain a criterion spike difference. In most cases, the level required was lowest at the best delay for the noise. The mean difference between maximum and minimum masked thresholds across the cell population was very similar to the human psychophysical masking level difference under the same signal and masker conditions. In another series of tests, we measured the effect of the noise masker on the temporal pattern of the discharge to the signal. The signal used was a 500-ms segment of the synthetic vowel. In virtually all cases the addition of a continuous noise masker reduced the discharge rate synchronized to the fundamental frequency of the vowel. The degree of this reduction was dependent on the interaural time delay of the noise masker. For most units, maximum reduction was seen when the vowel and noise had the same interaural time delay. The similarity between the masking which we have shown physiologically and that reported in a variety of human psychophysical experiments suggests that the processing at levels up to and including the inferior colliculus contributes to the psychophysical BMLD. © 1991.","Caird D.M., Palmer A.R., Rees A.",1991,Scopus,10.1016/0378-5955(91)90078-N,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025999357&doi=10.1016%2f0378-5955%2891%2990078-N&partnerID=40&md5=befd1f84b0bef5368c13b75ae01273bc
Electrophysiological study of spinothalamic inputs to ventrolateral and adjacent thalamic nuclei of the cat,"Extracellular and intracellular methods were used to record from fibers and neurons in the ventral lateral (VL) and adjacent nuclei of the cat thalamus. The receptive fields of the recorded units were analyzed and the units tested for inputs from the medial lemniscus (ML) and spinothalamic tract (STT) by electrical stimulation of the dorsal columns (DC) and ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) at the C2-3 spinal level. Thirty-eight STT fibers were isolated in the thalamus. Their conduction velocities ranged from 15 to 75 m/s (mode 36 m/s). Adequate stimuli were found for 23 of these fibers. Seventeen were low-threshold (LT), 3 were wide-dynamic-range (WDR), and 3 were high-threshold (HT) units. Five STT fibers were intra-axonally injected. Three were sufficiently well filled for analysis of their terminal fields. An intermediate-velocity STT fiber (conduction velocity 38 m/s) had a 4.3-μm axon and a single large terminal field in the central lateral nucleus (CL). The other two STT fibers were smaller, with diameters of 2.5 and 2.3 μm, conduction velocities of 15 and 19 m/s, and terminal fields made up of a few small boutons at the borders of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL). Of 319 neurons isolated, 14 out of 129 (10.8%) in VL, 14 out of 76 (18.4%) in the VPL or ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus, 27 out of 64 (42.2%) in the CL nucleus, and 5 out of 50 (10%) in the reticular nucleus (R) responded at latencies &lt;50 ms to VLF stimuli. A train of three pulses was more effective in driving VLF-responding neurons in all these nuclei than a single pulse. VLF-responding cells were widely dispersed in VL, concentrated in a focus in CL, and distributed around the borders of VPL. Most of those in VL and a small number in CL could be antidromically activated by stimulation of motor cortex. Latencies of presynaptic responses (STT fibers) to VLF stimulation were short and varied from 0.8 to 3.9 ms (mode 1.6 ms). Despite this, very few fast-responding neurons were found. These were six VPL neurons (2.5 to 4 ms), one VL neuron (3 ms), and four CL neurons (3-4 ms). The initial spike latencies of the majority of thalamic neurons responding to VLF stimulation appeared in two peaks, one between 6 and 8 ms and the other at 10-15 ms. By contrast, responses of ML fibers to DC stimulation, even with a synaptic delay in the DC or lateral cervical nuclei, peaked at 2-4 ms, and many VPL neurons responded to DC stimulation with an initial spike latency &lt;4 ms. Few or no neurons in the other nuclei had latencies ≤4 ms. The latencies of the small number of VL neurons responding to DC stimulation were ≥6 ms, implying polysynaptic activation. The shortest latencies of response of VL neurons to VLF stimulation included three recorded intracellularly, all showing initial excitatory postsynaptic potential latencies at 3 ms but initial spike latencies of 3, 7, and 9 ms. On the basis of the anatomic and electrophysiological data, therefore, it is likely that monosynaptic STT inputs to the individual thalamic cells studied are sparse and of low efficacy. Temporal summation is needed for activation in anesthetized animals. Even when activated, thalamic neurons show wide fluctuation in their spike latencies. Most of the isolated VL neurons responding to VLF stimulation could not be activated by natural stimuli. For the few neurons in which a receptive field was found, the adequate stimulus was usually slow and heavy tapping of the receptive field or occasionally intense pressure. These patterns of responsiveness were similar for CL neurons. A wider range of adequate stimuli was found for VPL neurons. Low-threshold units were found in the core of the VPL. Some of these units were inhibited by VLF stimuli. Excitatory VLF-responsive units were located at the borders of VPL. These neurons were either LT, WDR, or HT units. Some scattered R neurons also responded to these types of stimuli. Of the neurons responding to VLF stimulation at latencies &lt;50 ms, 4/16 (25%) of the VL neurons, 9/57 (16%) of the VPL neurons, and 22/36 (61%) of the CL neurons showed convergent excitatory inputs from VLF and DC stimulation. A small number of R neurons (4/19, or 21%) also showed convergent inputs. The results show fundamental similarities between STT recipient neurons in the VL and CL and at the borders of the VPL nuclei. They confirm the general lack of direct DC inputs to VL neurons and suggest that STT inputs to VL neurons are unlikely to form a basis for the fast relay of light tactile and proprioceptive information to the motor cortex.","Yen C.-T., Honda C.N., Jones E.G.",1991,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1991.66.3.1033,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025948983&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1991.66.3.1033&partnerID=40&md5=f99977cb4eb2f244696740040bd21470
Responses of locus coeruleus neurons to labyrinth and neck stimulation,"The electrical activity of a large population of locus coeruleus (LC)-complex neurons, some of which were antidromically activated by stimulation of the spinal cord at T12-L1, was recorded in precollicular decerebrate cats during labyrinth and neck stimulation. Some of these neurons showed physiological characteristics attributed to norepinephrine (NE)-containing LC neurons, i.e., (i) a slow and regular resting discharge; (ii) a typical biphasic response to compression of the paws consisting of short impulse bursts followed by a silent period, which was attributed to recurrent and/or lateral inhibition of the corresponding neurons; and (iii) a suppression of the resting discharge during episodes of postural atonia, associated with rapid eye movements (REM), induced by systemic injection of an anticholinesterase, a finding which closely resembled that occurring in intact animals during desynchronized sleep. Among the neurons tested, 80 of 141 (i.e., 56.7%) responded to the labyrinth input elicited by sinusoidal tilt about the longitudinal axis of the whole animal at the standard parameters of 0.15 Hz, ± 10°, and 73 of 99 (i.e., 73.7%) responded to the neck input elicited by rotation of the body about the longitudinal axis at the same parameters, while maintaining the head stationary. A periodic modulation of firing rate of the units was observed during the sinusoidal stimuli. In particular, most of the LC-complex units were maximally excited during side-up tilt of the animal and side-down neck rotation, the response peak occurring with an average phase lead of about + 17.9° and +34.2° with respect to the extreme animal and neck displacements, respectively. Similar results were also obtained from the antidromically identified coeruleospinal (CS) neurons. The degree of convergence and the modalities of interaction of vestibular and neck inputs on LC-complex neurons were also investigated. In addition to the results described above, the LC-complex neurons were also tested to changing parameters of stimulation. In particular, both static and dynamic components of single unit responses were elicited by increasing frequencies of animal tilt and neck rotation. Moreover, the relative stability of the phase angle of the responses evaluated with respect to the animal position in most of the units tested at increasing frequencies of tilt allowed the conclusion to attribute these responses to the properties of macular ultricular receptors. This conclusion is supported by the results of experiments showing that LC-complex neurons displayed steady changes in their discharge rate during static tilt of the animal. These findings are discussed in relation to the facts that: (i) the predominant patterns of response of the LC-complex neurons as well as the CS neurons to animal tilt and neck rotation are opposite to those of the vestibulospinal (VS) neurons projecting to the same segments of the spinal cord, and (ii) the former neurons exert an inhibitory influence on Renshaw cells, while the latter exert an excitatory influence on them, due to activation of ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons and their recurrent collaterals. We postulated that periodic changes in firing rate of the antidromically identified CS neurons during animal tilt and neck rotation might change the functional coupling of the ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons with their own Renshaw cells, thus intervening in the gain regulation of the corresponding VS and cervicospinal reflexes. As to the unidentified LC-complex neurons responsive to the same stimuli, they might be involved in the labyrinthine and cervical control of functions other than posture. © 1991, Elsevier B.V.

Patterns of activity coding discrimination of auditory stimuli differ between mid- and posterolateral thalamus of cats,"The auditory function of units in the mid- (lateralis dorsalis and centrolateral nuclei) and posterolateral (lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex) thalamus of cats was assessed during performance of conditioned eye blink responses (CRs) elicited discriminatively by a forward-paired, 70 dB click conditioned stimulus (CS) as opposed to a backward-paired, 70 dB hiss discriminative stimulus (DS). Discharges in response to the CS or DS were found in over 40% of units tested in each area, with onset latencies as short as 28-32 msec in mid-thalamus and 14 msec in posterolateral thalamus. The results provide evidence that both mid- and posterolateral thalamic regions of cats contain sufficient numbers of auditory responsive neurons to be considered part of the auditory system functionally. Patterns of activity changed after conditioning discriminative responses to the click CS. In mid-thalamus, the ratio of CS-evoked activity to baseline activity increased relative to levels found before conditioning. This increase was attributable to an increase in the magnitude of response to the CS. In posterolateral thalamus, an increase in the signal: noise ratio of activity in response to the CS was also found after conditioning, but this increase depended in large part on a decrease in the rate of baseline firing. Posterolateral thalamic units had substantially higher mean rates of baseline firing than mid-thalamic units before any conditioning sessions were begun. In all, different rates of baseline activity, means of enhancing activity in response to the click CS, and onsets of response were found at these two adjacent thalamic regions in which the unit response to the CS became greater than that to the DS after conditioning. We conclude that each region makes a separate contribution to information processing needed to discriminate effectively between auditory stimuli of different functional significance.","Woody C.D., Melamed O., Chizhevsky V.",1991,Scopus,10.1523/jneurosci.11-11-03379.1991,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025786505&doi=10.1523%2fjneurosci.11-11-03379.1991&partnerID=40&md5=776ff60cbea89b31166560a3835510f9
Recordings from cat trapezoid body and HRP labeling of globular bushy cell axons,"1. Recordings were made from single nerve fibers in barbiturate-anesthetized cats in the midline trapezoid body, a location that permits selective sampling of efferent cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus. Single units were localized to either the dorsal or ventral components of the trapezoid body. The fibers were physiologically classified on the basis of their peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) and receptive-field properties. In addition, low characteristic frequency (CF) units were probed for rapid rate and phase shifts with increases in intensity. The projection patterns of some fibers were traced by iontophoresing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into their axons. 2. HRP-labeled fibers most likely originated from globular bushy cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus in that they sent a large branch into the contralateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body which terminated in a calyceal ending and an ipsilateral branch into the lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body. A thin branch, usually starting from the large branch, wound its way through the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body to its termination in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body. Additional branches from the parent axon could pass through medial periolivary groups throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the superior olivary complex. The parent fiber was traced as far as the ventral lateral lemniscus where it faded before reaching its termination. 3. The majority of units were recorded in the ventral component of the trapezoid body. Although the ventral component is comprised of both large and small diameter fibers, our sample was biased to the larger diameter fibers representing the activity of axons originating from globular bushy cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus. Ventral component units were not tonotopically arrayed and had CFs that spanned the audible range for cats. HRP labeling of ventral component axons revealed that the section of the axon traveling through the midline shifted its dorsal-ventral location. This pattern was compatible with the lack of tonotopy found in the ventral component. Recordings were also made from the dorsal component of the trapezoid body, which contained medium diameter axons. These axons originated from spherical bushy cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus. Dorsal component units were tonotopically arrayed and had CFs <7 kHz. 4. Cells were characterized by their PSTH at CF. Primary-like and phase-locked units constituted most of the dorsal component units. Primary-notch, onset-L, and chopper units were found almost exclusively in the domain of the ventral component. Primary-notch and onset-L units shared the shortest first-spike latency of any PSTH group, had the smallest standard deviation of first-spike latencies, and appeared to be a continuum of the same PSTH category, differing only in sustained rate. Chopper units also had precise first-spike latencies, but their mean latencies tended to be longer than primary-notch and onset-L units. Chopper units constituted only 11% of the recordings from the ventral component and were recorded from the ventral border of the ventral component. A first-order interval analysis indicated that chopper units could be subcategorized in the same way as units recorded directly from the cochlear nucleus. Chopper units probably represent the activity of stellate cells in the cochlear nucleus, indicating that these cells may be sampled from a restricted region of the trapezoid body. 5. The receptive fields of 22 ventral component neurons were mapped by the use of pure tones and correlated with PSTH responses. Inhibitory sidebands were found in 18 of these fibers. Sideband inhibition was associated with primary-like, primary-notch, and the only chopper unit tested. None of the five dorsal component units for which receptive fields were obtained had inhibitory sidebands. 6. The spontaneous and driven rate distributions for dorsal and ventral component units were very different from those of the auditory nerve. The majority of low CF units (<6 kHz) of the ventral component had spontaneous rates <10 spikes/s; high CF units of the ventral component had a wide range of spontaneous rates, up to 110 spikes/s. Dorsal component units rarely displayed spontaneous rates <10 spikes/s. Maximum driven rates of primary-like, chopper, and primary-notch units could be very high, on the order of 500-600 spikes/s. Driven rates >450 spikes/s came only from units with CFs >8 kHz.","Spirou G.A., Brownell W.E., Zidanic M.",1990,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1990.63.5.1169,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025277771&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1990.63.5.1169&partnerID=40&md5=c09a93337753d3f0dd3d64981f8c5745
Chemosensitivity of fine afferents from rat skin in vitro,"Properties of sensory receptors with slowly conducting nerve fibers (&lt; 10 m/s) were studied using a rat skin-saphenous nerve in vitro preparation where receptive fields of identified single units can be isolated and superfused at the corium side with defined chemical solutions. With mechanical search stimuli, 150 slowly adapting units were identified, 88% C-fibers, and the remainder, Aδ-fibers. The majority of these units (65%) were categorized as mechano-heat sensitive ('polymodal') with controlled radiant heat stimulation. The remaining units were classified as low- or high-threshold mechanoreceptors according to their von Frey thresholds. Bradykinin (BK), in concentrations of 10-8 to 10-4 M, was repeatedly applied for 1 min at 10-min intervals. Fifty-six percent of the polymodal C-fibers responded to BK (up to 10-5 M), in contrast to 17% of the heat-insensitive units (P &lt; 0.01). No correlation between BK sensitivity and conduction velocity or von Frey threshold was found. The Bk 'threshold concentrations' to excite C- and Aδ-fibers were about equally distributed over a range from 10-8 to 10-5 M. There was a large interindividual variability in pattern and magnitude of the response to BK. Intraindividually, a marked tachyphylaxis upon repeated BK stimulation was observed. In fibers with a slow development of tachyphylaxis, the effects of conditioning application of different chemicals on BK responsiveness were studied. Norepinephrine in 10-7 M concentration did not produce a significant effect, whereas 10-5 M and 10-4 M seemed to increase the BK responses. Prostaglandin E2 (10-6 M) caused a weak sensitization to BK on average (n.s.), but serotonin (10-6 M) was clearly effective (P &lt; 0.05). The strongest sensitization to BK (P = 0.01) resulted from conditioning heat stimulation, which also uncovered a responsiveness in some units initially insensitive to BK. In some experiments the calcium concentration in the superfusate of receptive fields was lowered to 0.3 mM, which induced ongoing activity in C-fibers and markedly increased the BK responses in two polymodal units tested. Increasing the calcium concentration to 3.0 mM reversed these effects. After completing the BK test protocol, polymodal C-fibers were exposed to other chemicals. All BK-sensitive units tested were also excited by capsaicin (10-5 M), 75% by histamine (10-4 M) and 43% by serotonin (10-5 M). Among the BK-insensitive units, only one of seven fibers was excited by histamine, none by serotonin, and only three of six units by capsaicin. Heat thresholds of C-fibers treated with and sensitive to BK were significantly lower than those of BK-insensitive or untreated units. Irrespective of any chemical treatments, the von Frey thresholds of all units remained essentially unchanged throughout the experiments.","Lang E., Novak A., Reeh P.W., Handwerker H.O.",1990,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1990.63.4.887,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025274415&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1990.63.4.887&partnerID=40&md5=8731f843e61f8a1e7d4755e4d0e86eb2
A region in the dorsolateral striatum of the rat exhibiting single-unit correlations with specific locomotor limb movements,"1. To examine the activity of single units in the lateral striatum of the awake rat with respect to sensorimotor function, 788 units were recorded during locomotion and passive testing. The focus of this report is on 138 units (18%) that fired in relation to sensorimotor activity of a single limb. The remaining units were related to other body parts (16%), to general body movement (38%), or were unresponsive (28%). 2. Firing rates of limb-related units were near zero during resting behavior but increased markedly during treadmill locomotion. Each of the 138 units exhibited a rhythmic pattern of discharge in phase with the locomotor step cycle. Passive testing revealed that 86/97 units tested (89%) responded to passive manipulation of a single limb, exhibiting increased firing rates. Of these, 77 (90%) were related to contralateral and 9 (10%) to ipsilateral limbs. Sixty-one units (71%) were related to a forelimb and 25 (29%) to a hindlimb. Of the 86 units responding to passive manipulation, 34/48 units tested (71%) also responded to cutaneous stimulation of the same limb but not other part of the body. 3. To study in greater detail the rhythmic unit discharges in phase with the locomotor step cycle, computer-synchronized videotape recordings were used to generate perimovement time histograms constructed around discrete locomotor movements of each limb (n = 17 units). Activity of each unit was shown to be restricted to a specific portion of a particular limb's step cycle. The majority of units discharged throughout (8 units) or during a portion of (3 units) the swing phase, whereas other units fired during a portion of stance (3 units), footfall (2 units), or foot off (1 unit). 4. The specificity of unit firing was further demonstrated by the finding that rhythmic discharges, related to discrete locomotor limb movements in the forward direction, were completely absent during spontaneous deviations such as backward or disrupted locomotion. 5. Units related to limb movement were located in the far lateral, especially the dorsolateral, subregion of the striatum. This subregion extended rostrocaudally from A-P + 1.6 to -1.0 mm relative to bregma. No clear somatotopic organization was observed, but this issue requires further study. 6. These results show that functional representations of individual limbs can be demonstrated in the lateral striatum of the rat, within a subregion containing terminals of projections from somatic sensorimotor cortex. Taken together with the lack of this type of specificity previously shown for units in more medial striatal subregions, these findings support the idea of a functional differentiation between the medial and lateral striatum of the rat.","West M.O., Carelli R.M., Pomerantz M., Cohen S.M., Gardner J.P., Chapin J.K., Woodward D.J.",1990,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1990.64.4.1233,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025155044&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1990.64.4.1233&partnerID=40&md5=7bae3c0aeba8d21fc5d5380d6df20082
Fine structure of the lateral mammillary projection to the dorsal tegmental nucleus of gudden in the rat,"The synaptic organization of projections from the lateral mammillary neurons within the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden is studied in the rat with the aid of anterograde transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA‐HRP) and visualized with tetramethylbenzidine. The dorsal tegmental nucleus consists of the pars ventralis (TDV) and the pars dorsalis (TDD). The normal neuropil of the dorsal tegmental nucleus contains three classes of axodendritic terminals, that is, terminals containing round, flat, and pleomorphic vesicles. They make up 44%, 5%, and 51%, respectively, of all axodendritic terminals in the TDV, and 62%, 1%, and 37% in the TDD. Injection of WGA‐HRP into the lateral mammillary nucleus permits ultrastructural recognition of many anterograde labeled terminals within both the TDV and TDD. In the TDV, 81% of the labeled terminals contain round synaptic vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts. A few of the labeled terminals contain pleomorphic vesicles and make symmetric synaptic contacts. More than 50% of the labeled terminals contact intermediate dendrites (1–2 μm diameter). In the TDD, almost all labeled terminals are small, contain round vesicles, and make asymmetric synaptic contacts. These terminals mainly contact intermediate as well as distal (less than 1 μm diameter) dendrites. There are only a few labeled terminals with pleomorphic vesicles and no terminals with flat vesicles. The termination pattern of the lateral mammillary neurons in the TDV is similar to that in the TDD. Anterograde labeled axon terminals often contact retrograde labeled dendrites in the TDV. No reciprocal connections are present in the TDD. These results suggest that the TDV and the TDD receive mainly excitatory and a few inhibitory inputs from the lateral mammillary nucleus. The TDV neurons also have direct reciprocal connections with the lateral mammillary neurons.

Discharge patterns of ventrolateral medullary neurons during muscular contraction,"Static muscular contraction is known to elicit reflex increases in arterial pressure. However, the areas of the central nervous system that mediate this reflex remain elusive. A recent study from this laboratory suggested that neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) participate in the pressor reflex to muscular contraction. In the present study, we sought to ascertain whether extracellular single-unit activity of VLM neurons is altered by static contraction of hindlimb muscles. In anesthetized cats, muscular contraction elicited by stimulation of L7 and S1 ventral roots evoked increases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and minute ventilation. The firing frequency in 33 of 50 VLM units increased &gt; 70% during muscular contraction. VLM units displayed two types of discharge patterns in response to contraction: 1) a rapid onset response (0.5-3 s) and 2) a delayed onset response (10-20 s). Computer averaging analysis showed that 14 of 28 VLM units tested had a cardiac-related rhythm and 10 of those 14 also responded to muscular contraction. Muscular contraction had no effect on the discharge patterns of most neurons located outside the VLM. These findings suggest that neurons in the ventrolateral medulla respond to muscular contraction and may have a role in the pressor reflex to muscular contraction.","Bauer R.M., Iwamoto G.A., Waldrop T.G.",1990,Scopus,10.1152/ajpregu.1990.259.3.r606,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0025046513&doi=10.1152%2fajpregu.1990.259.3.r606&partnerID=40&md5=235419b475174161c18d9c1ac5d9fbec
Pharyngeal motoneurones: respiratory-related activity and responses to laryngeal afferents in the decerebrate cat,"In decerebrate, paralyzed and artificially ventilated cats, we recorded the discharge of 64 motor axons supplying the pharyngeal muscles. Filaments containing motor axons, with discharges related to the respiratory cycle (phrenic nerve activity), were teased from the pharyngeal branches of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. Most units (n = 41) fired only during expiration and exhibited a steady, a decreasing or a late augmenting discharge pattern. These units were found only in vagal filaments. Twenty three units discharged during inspiration and exhibited a steady, a late augmenting or a tonic discharge pattern. The inspiratory-related units were present in both the vagus (n=13) and glossopharyngeal (n=10) nerves. Nineteen of 20 pharyngeal inspiratoryrelated units tested were activated at short latency (range 3.4 to 8.0 ms) by stimulation of afferents in the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN). In 13 of these, such stimulation also suppressed their spontaneous activity. SLN stimulation elicited in all 17 pharyngeal expiratory-related units tested a short latency (range 0 to 8 ms) reduction of activity, followed in 7 units by an increase in activity. SLN stimulation occasionally evoked single or rhythmic multifibre bursts in the vagal pharyngeal filaments. These bursts, involving expiratory-related units, likely correspond to the buccopharyngeal stage of swallowing. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Grélot L., Barillot J.C., Bianchi A.L.",1989,Scopus,10.1007/BF00228905,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024787822&doi=10.1007%2fBF00228905&partnerID=40&md5=d656076b585acce3e827e977e4ef4db0
Ia reflexes and EPSPs in human soleus motor neurones,"The reflex responses of single motor units in the soleus muscle to electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve were recorded in human volunteers. A feature of the experiments was the stimulation paradigm used. In order to control the peristimulus firing rate, a computer triggered the stimulus isolator only when 2 interspike intervals of specified duration occurred in succession. In addition, the timing of the stimulus in relation to the preceding action potential was controlled in a manner similar to a conditioning/testing paradigm. The general pattern of response was an initial, ""H-reflex"" excitation at monosynaptic latency, followed first by a silent period due to the refractoriness of the motor neurone, then by other phases of reduced activity. When the stimulus intensity was increased, the intensity of the excitation and the duration of the silent period increased in parallel. When the pre-stimulus firing rate of the motor unit was varied, the amplitude of the H-reflex response, normalized to the number of stimulus trials, was similar at 6, 8 and 10 Hz, but was greater at 4 Hz in most units tested. These findings were consistent with a simple model of the events occurring at the cell membrane in this reflex which was proposed by Ashby and Zilm (1982a), although some modification of the model was necessary to account for the different response at 4 Hz. The improved stimulation paradigm enabled a direct estimate to be made of the amplitude and shape of the rising phase of the Ia EPSP in human motor neurones. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Miles T.S., Türker K.S., Le T.H.",1989,Scopus,10.1007/BF00249616,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024342454&doi=10.1007%2fBF00249616&partnerID=40&md5=8e8c81142bea7fb7c6128182811c0f37
VAGAL GASTRIC EFFERENT ACTIVITY AND ITS REFLEX CHANGES IN CONSCIOUS SHEEP,"Electromyographical recordings from neck muscles reinnervated by the vagus nerve allowed monitoring of vagal output to the reticulo‐rumen in conscious sheep. The vagus nerve was sectioned below the nodose ganglion and its central end anastomosed with the peripheral end of the spinal accessory nerve, which innervates the trapezius and mastoido‐humeral muscles. Fifty‐three vagal efferent units recorded were identified and classified into seven distinguishable types on the basis of their temporal relationship with gastric movements. With respect to their patterns of discharge during the primary cycles type I to type V units were similar to units of the corresponding types described by Iggo &amp; Leek (1967a) in anaesthetized sheep. Evidence for the hypothesis that each type of gastric unit innervates a distinct region of the reticulo‐rumen is strongest for types I and IV. Type I units which exhibited a bimodal pattern of discharge closely associated with reticular motility, are presumed to innervate the reticulum. Some of them, so‐called Ib because of their second burst with a long tail and their activity during the secondary cycles, are considered to activate the zone of attachment of the reticulum to the rumen. Type IV units which were active during the ruminal contractions of both primary and secondary cycles are considered to innervate the dorsal rumen. Discharges in these gastric units were observed when gastric motility was partially or totally abolished after administering autonomic blocking drugs for each unit tested (n = 25). They consisted of (i) a shortening of intervals between the onset of two successive bursts, and (ii) an increase in the duration of discharge and the number of potentials in the efferent units. As the abolition of gastric motility led to a decrease of gastric afferent input, these results suggest that the gastric centres are under a permanent inhibitory influence from the afferent drive. © 1989 The Physiological Society","Dalal A., Rousseau J.P., Laplace J.P.",1989,Scopus,10.1113/expphysiol.1989.sp003271,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024371898&doi=10.1113%2fexpphysiol.1989.sp003271&partnerID=40&md5=02a68d0db72453a4f1ca7a08b94635ed
Carbon Dioxide Responses of the Lateral Line Organ in the Carp Cyprinus carpio,"The responsiveness of free neuromasts (pit organs), innervated by a buccal branch of the anterior lateral line nerve, the ramus buccalis, in the carp Cyprinus carpio to carbon dioxide dissolved in distilled water was studied using whole nerve and single unit recording techniques. The stimulation of the carp pit organ with C02 solution produced a large phasic response followed by a long period (60-90s) of depression in impulse discharges. These temporal patterns of integrated responses were C02-specific and differed from those of various acids, in which an initial phasic response was followed by a plateau level of neural activity sustained during the stimulation. The magnitude of the C02 responses was slightly pH-dependent, suggesting that dissolved free C02 may have a facilitating effect on the receptor cell. All the single units tested responded to C02 and other acids with response patterns similar to those in whole nerve recordings. No specicfic single units responding to C02 alone were detected, showing the receptor cells to be ';generalist' in nature. © 1989, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Single unit activity in the auditory cortex of a monkey performing a short term memory task,"Short term memory to tones (STMT) was investigated by recording single unit activity in the auditory cortex of a behaving monkey. The activity of each unit was studied in two behavioral conditions: a) During task performance, the monkey had to compare two tones separated by one second of silence (inter-stimulus interval), b) During a nonperforming period; the monkey heard the two tones but did not respond behaviorally. It was noted that the firing rate of many units during the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was dependent on the frequency of the first tone. Such dependency was observed even towards the end of the ISI, both during task performance trials (50% of the units) and during the nonperforming period (32% of the units). The activity of these units could be the basis of STMT in both of these behavioral states. In 65% of all the units tested, the responses during the ISI were of a higher magnitude in the performance period than were the responses in the non-performance period. The activity of these units may be related either to general processes such as attention and expectation or to short-term memory processes. During task performance, the responses of 23% of the units to the second tone were dependent on whether its frequency was identical to that of the first tone. Such dependency was never observed during the non-performing period. These units may detect similarity or non similarity between two tones presented one second apart. Periodic patterns of firing were not found in the study, thus suggesting that the ISI responses were not generated by reverberatory activity in simple closed loops. On the basis of these results, several alternative mechanisms of STMT are suggested. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.","Gottlieb Y., Vaadia E., Abeles M.",1989,Scopus,10.1007/BF00248287,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024558547&doi=10.1007%2fBF00248287&partnerID=40&md5=0aba967ceaa3b63ffed3f336afafedcb
Effects of electrical and natural stimulation of skin afferents on the γ-spindle system of the triceps surae muscle,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent to which skin receptors might influence the responses of primary muscle spindle afferents via reflex actions on the fusimotor system. The experiments were performed on 43 cats anaesthetized with α-chloralose. The alterations in fusimotor activity were assessed from changes in the responses of the muscle spindle afferents to sinusoidal stretching of their parent muscles (triceps surae and plantaris). The mean rate of firing and the modulation of the afferent response were determined. Control measurements were made in absence of any cutaneous stimulation. Tests were made (a) during physiological stimulation of skin afferents of the ipsilateral pad or of the contralateral hindlimb, or (b) during repetitive electrical stimulation of the sural nerve in the ipsilateral hindlimb, or of sural or superficial peroneal nerve in the contralateral hindlimb. Of the total number of 113 units tested with repetitive electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral sural nerve (at 20 Hz), 24.8% exhibited predominantly dynamic fusimotor reflexes, 5.3% mixed or predominantly static fusimotor reflexes. One unit studied in a preparation with intact spinal cord exhibited static reflexes at low stimulation intensities and dynamic ones at higher stimulation strengths. The remaining units (69%) were uninfluenced. When the receptor-bearing muscle was held at constant length and a train of stimuli (at 20 Hz) was applied to the ipsilateral sural nerve, the action potentials in the primary muscle spindle afferent could be stimulus-locked to the 3rd or 4th pulse in the train (and to the pulses following thereafter), with a latency of about 24 ms from the effective pulse. This 1 : 1 pattern of driving seemed to be mediated via static and/or dynamic fusimotor neurons. Natural stimulation influenced comparatively few units (3 of 65 units tested from the ipsilateral pad and 10 of 98 tested from the contralateral hindlimb), but when the effects were present they were quite large. The results are discussed in relation to previous studies on reflex control of fusimotor neurones from cutaneous afferents. It is suggested that the wide range of fusimotor effects from cutaneous afferent fibres observed in this study (from complete absence of any effect, via moderate excitatory and inhibitory effects, to the 'driving pattern', i.e. pulse-to-pulse response) may reflect that different γ-motoneurones have individualized reflex profiles10,33,34,36, and it may also indicate that groups of fusimotor neurones and spindle afferents play specific roles in different motor acts 39. © 1989.","Johansson H., Sjölander P., Sojka P., Wadell I.",1989,Scopus,10.1016/0168-0102(89)90043-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024415452&doi=10.1016%2f0168-0102%2889%2990043-6&partnerID=40&md5=2c4df02793bb5c5c780161a1c0e1bfe5
Opioid inhibition of spontaneously active neurons of the rat arcuate nucleus in vitro,"The effects of opioid agonists were determined on single-unit activity recorded from the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in perfused, coronal slices of hypothalamus taken from proestrous rats., The selective, μ-receptor agonist Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol enkephalin (DAGO) produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the firing rate of 70-78% of the units tested. The concentration of DAGO that induced maximal inhibition of firing was approximately 0.5 μM. This inhibition of firing frequency occurred irrespective of cell location, firing pattern or baseline firing frequency. The effect of DAGO was antagonized by the opioid antagonist naloxone (0.1 μM). The selective κ-receptor agonist trans-(+)-34 dichloro-N-methyl-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl] benzeneacetamide methane sulfonate (U50,488H) did not decrease the firing rate in cells which did respond to DAGO. Blockade of synaptic activity decreased the level of spontaneous activity but did not prevent the inhibitory action of DAGO. These data support the hypothesis that opioids through activation of μ-receptors, inhibit neuronal activity in the arcuate nucleus. Furthermore, the opioid inhibition occurs in part via a direct postsynaptic action. © 1989.","Loose M.D., Kelly M.J.",1989,Scopus,10.1016/0361-9230(89)90024-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024383120&doi=10.1016%2f0361-9230%2889%2990024-5&partnerID=40&md5=f1b2e4323e1e323b31c1a150dd5abf5b
Brain stem responses to electrical stimulation of ventral vagal gastric fibers,"The brain stem neuronal responses to electrical stimulation of gastric branches of the ventral vagal trunk serving the proximal stomach were localized and evaluated in anesthetized cats. The responses were equally distributed bilaterally in the region of nucleus solitarius in the caudal brain stem. The mean latency of the response was 289 ± 46 (SD) ms, which translated into a condition velocity of <1 m/s based on the distance between the stimulating and recording electrodes. The responses consisted of single and multiple spikes that showed slight variability in the latency, indicating orthodromic activation via a synapse in ~98% of the responses recorded. Forty two percent of the units tested showed evidence of convergence of input from vagal afferent fibers in different branches of the ventral vagal trunk that served the proximal stomach. The resultant activity pattern of the unitary response appeared to be the product of 1) the gastric sensory input or modality conveyed by the afferent source and 2) the time of arrival and diversity of modalities served by other gastric afferents impinging on the unit. This provides a mechanism capable of responding on the basis of specific sensory modalities that dynamically reflect ongoing events monitored and conveyed by other gastric afferents in the region.","Barber W.D., Yuan C.-S.",1989,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0024335889&partnerID=40&md5=872926e9bbe42589f54df992855def23
Deep tectal cells in pigeons respond to kinematograms,"Deep tectal neurons in pigeons respond selectively to moving visual stimuli, and are inhibited by large background patterns moved in-phase with these stimuli. In this investigation we demonstrate that these same deep tectal neurons respond equally well to kinematograms as they do to traditional luminance contrast stimuli typically employed in visual experiments. Computer generated kinematograms, the motion domain equivalents of random dot stereograms, were used as stimuli in these experiments. These kinematograms, where a small centrally located set of random dots is moved coherently in one direction while the remaining dots are moved in a different direction, thus constitute a pure motion stimulus where the stimulus form is only visible in the dynamic pattern, but does not exist on any single frame. Both 'object' configured and 'hole' configured kinematograms were employed; the former appearing as regions of texture moving over, or in front of, the background texture, while the latter appear as windows through which a more distant textured surface is revealed. Extracellular recordings from isolated deep tectal cells showed that all units responded in a very similar manner whether the stimulus was an 'object' configured kinematogram or the more traditional luminance contrast variety. This similarity included directional selectivity, the in-phase inhibition anti-phase facilitation effect, and sensitivity to opposed motion independent of direction. However, when the kinematograms were configured as 'holes' none of the units tested responded to these stimuli. The significance of these observations for tectal functioning, image segmentation through motion and animal camouflage is discussed. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.","Frost B.J., Cavanagh P., Morgan B.",1988,Scopus,10.1007/BF01342639,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023889326&doi=10.1007%2fBF01342639&partnerID=40&md5=2248aa347b916529328021e6e1e75174

Neuronal coding of linear motion in the vestibular nuclei of the alert cat - III. Dynamic characteristics of visual-otolith interactions,"In the present study we have investigated in the awake cat the response dynamics of vestibular nuclei neurons to visual or/and otolith stimulation elicited by vertical linear motion. Of the 53 units tested during sinusoidal motion at 0.05 Hz (9.1 cm/ s), 1 (1.9%) was responsive to the otolith input only, 13 (24.5%) were influenced by the visual input only and 23 (43.4%) responded to both modalities. Neurons were excited either during upward or downward animal or visual surround movement. Most units displayed a firing rate modulation very close to motion velocity. All the neurons receiving convergent visual and otolith inputs (0.05 Hz, 9.1 cm/s) exhibited synergistic patterns of response. Motion velocity coding was improved in terms of inputoutput phase relationship and response sensitivity when visual and otolith signals were combined. Depending on the units, visual-otolith interactions in single neurons could follow a linear or a nonlinear mode of summation. The dynamic characteristics of visual-otolith interactions were examined in the 0.05 Hz-0.50 Hz frequency bandwidth. Visual signals seemed to predominate over otolith signals at low stimulus frequencies (up to 0.25 Hz), while the contrary was found in the higher frequency range of movement (above 0.25 Hz). The effects of visual stabilization (VS: suppression of visual motion cues) was observed in a small sample of units. As a rule, VS induced a reduction in the amplitude of unit response as compared to visual + otolith stimulation, the lower the motion frequency, the more pronounced the attenuation. VS also decreased the amplitude of the otolith-dependent component of response. The possible modes of visual-vestibular interactions in single cells are discussed.

The effect of radiation damage on the thermoluminescence properties of mineral sphene,"Radiation damage in mineral sphene has been found to cause adverse effects on its thermoluminescence (TL) properties. An inverse correlation has, for instance, been found between the amount of artificially induced α-damage and the TL sensitivity (i.e. the TL output per unit test dose of γ-rays). As the degree of damage in natural samples of sphene (gauged by their fossil fission tracks) was varied by means of annealing for 1 h at various temperatures, it was found that there were two phases which characterized the pattern of the TL sensitivity. A comparison was made of the effect of annealing on the TL sensitivity of natural samples and that of aliquots from the same samples which had been completely annealed and then irradiated with (i) ∼30 MeV α-particles at a fluence of up to 1016 α cm-2 from a cyclotron, and (ii) reactor thermal neutrons to induce fission in the U-contents of the crystals. It was found that the TL sensitivity of artificially damaged samples exhibited patterns broadly similar to those of natural samples.

Septal neurons respond to activation of baro- and chemoreceptors in the rat,"Because it has recently between shown that selective activation of neuronal perikarya in the septal area elicits arterial depressor responses, it seems reasonable to except that information from receptors in the cardiovascular system may be related to the septum. This possibility was investigated by searching for single units in the medial and lateral septal nuclei responding to activation of baroreceptors, elicited either by electrical stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve (ADN) or by systemic injection of phenylephrine (PE), or responding to activation of chemoreceptors, elicited by intracarotid injection of sodium cyanide. Fifty-four male Wistar rats weighing 300-400 g were anesthetized with urethan (1.4 g/kg ip) or α-chloralose-urethan (35 and 400 mg/kg ip, respectively) and allowed to breathe spontaneously. One-third of spontaneously firing units tested responded to ADN stimulation; these 93 units were divided into two groups according to their response patterns; 62 (67%) showed an increase and 31 (33%) a decrease in their discharge. Of 35 units tested, 6 responded to intravenous injection of PE. The majority of the units (48 of 60) affected by chemoreceptor activation were excited, and the remaining 12 were inhibited.

Effects of roll tilt of the animal and neck rotation on different size vestibulospinal neurons in decerebrate cats with the cerebellum intact,"1. In decerebrate cats with the cerebellum intact we recorded the activity of lateral vestibulospinal neurons projecting to lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord (lVS neurons) and related the resting discharge, as well as the response characteristics of these neurons to roll tilt of the animal and neck rotation, with the cell size inferred from the conduction velocity of the corresponding axons. 2. A slight negative correlation was found between resting discharge rate and conduction velocity of the whole population of lVS neurons responsive and unresponsive to animal tilt and neck rotation, so that the faster the conduction velocity, the lower was the unit discharge at rest. This correlation, however, was found only for the dorsocaudal LVN neurons, which contributed to the majority of lVS units, but not for the rostroventral LVN neurons. Moreover, it affected the units unresponsive but not those responsive to vestibular stimulation; the opposite, however, occurred for the units tested to neck stimulation. These findings indicate that the static properties of the lVS neurons can only in part be related to cell size. 3. If we consider the lVS neurons responsive to roll tilt of the animal (76 neurons) and neck rotation (75 neurons) at the standard parameters of 0.026 Hz, ±10°, no significant correlation was found between gain (impulses·s-1·deg-1) of the labyrinth or neck responses and conduction velocity of the axons. Thus, due to the presence of slight negative relation between resting discharge and conduction velocity of the axons, larger neurons exhibited a greater percentage modulation (sensitivity) to the labyrinth and neck inputs than smaller neurons; this correlation involved particularly the dcLVN neurons. These findings suggest that the afferent pathways driven during dynamic stimulation of labyrinth and neck receptors produce an higher number or density of synaptic contacts on lVS neurons of increasing size. 4. No significant differences in the means of resting discharge, conduction velocity, gain and sensitivity were found between all the lVS units responding to labyrinth and neck inputs. These findings indicate that the effectiveness of the two inputs was almost comparable and did not vary in different units as a function of cell size. 5. The lVS neurons were mainly excited during side-down animal tilt and side-up neck rotation. Although these neurons showed the same spectrum of conduction velocity as those displaying the opposite response patterns, the response gains of the predominant populations of units were on the average higher than those obtained from the remaining populations of units. The peak of the unit responses occurred with an average phase lead of +21.0±27.2°, SD with respect to the extreme animal displacements, and an average phase lead of +52.0±18.3, SD with respect to the extreme neck displacements; yet no difference was found in the average phase angle of responses of the two populations of slow and fast units to animal tilt or neck rotation. These findings indicate that the quantitative and qualitative organization of the synaptic inputs represent the critical factor controlling response characteristics of comparable size lVS neurons to vestibular and neck stimulations. 6. A comparison between the present results and those obtained in previous experiments performed after bilateral ablation of the paleocerebellum permitted to evaluate the role that the inhibitory area of the cerebellum exerts on the resting discharge, as well as on the dynamic characteristics of response of different size lVS neurons to animal tilt and neck rotation. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Pompeiano O., Manzoni S., Marchand A.R., Stampacchia G.",1987,Scopus,10.1007/BF00584746,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023203983&doi=10.1007%2fBF00584746&partnerID=40&md5=0b6c57a6f06818f8e29edaf51bb214a3
Neuronal coding of linear motion in the vestibular nuclei of the alert cat - I. Response characteristics to vertical otolith stimulation,"The aim of the present study was to investigate some aspects of the central processing of otolith information during linear motion. For this purpose, the response characteristics of 69 vestibular nuclei units to sinusoidal otolith stimulation in the vertical Z axis were analysed in the alert cat. Among this population of neurons which responded to a 0.05 Hz, 290 mm translation, 47 units (70%) displayed a firing rate modulation which followed the input frequency (H1 units). The majority of these neurons exhibited an increase in discharge rate during upward displacement, with a response phase close to the motion velocity or slightly leading downward acceleration. The acceleration related units were divided into two groups according to whether they showed clear increases or only a slight change in discharge rate when the stimulus frequency was increased. The former group was characterized by an average -16.3 dB drop in gain (from 43.9±1.8 dB, S.D. to 27.6±7 dB, S.D.) within the 0.05 Hz-0.5 Hz frequency range, while the latter group displayed an average -31.2 dB gain attenuation (from 45.1±1.1 dB, S.D. to 13.9±0 dB) within the same decade. In contrast to differences in response gain, all the units tested exhibited a relatively stable phase lead of about 20° with respect to downward peak acceleration. Conversely, units whose response was close to motion velocity in the lower frequency range (0.05 Hz-0.10 Hz) displayed a strong phase lead of about 100° when the stimulus frequency was increased (up to 0.50 Hz). These neurons were thus characterized by an acceleration related response in the higher frequency range. At the same time, an average -24.8 dB gain attenuation (from 47.7±3.4 dB to 22.9±3.7 dB) was found in the 0.05 Hz-0.5 Hz decade. The remaining 22 neurons (30%) were called H2 units since they displayed a response waveform double that of the input frequency, a response already described during sinusoidal rotation. Unit discharge reached a peak approximately in phase with maximum upward and downward velocity. Asymmetrical change in unit firing rate about the resting discharge level and different dynamic behavior of the upward and downward response components were usually found. These response characteristics suggest that the H2 patterns are centrally constructed and could result from convergence of otolith afferents having opposite polarization vectors. Other evidence suggests that these units which behave like motion-detectors can exert an influence on the neck musculature. Our results corroborate, at least in part, the findings of previous studies on the dynamic responses properties of otolith-dependent central neurons during roll tilt, or pure linear acceleration in the horizontal plane. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Xerri C., Barthélémy J., Harlay F., Borel L., Lacour M.",1987,Scopus,10.1007/BF00235980,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023099931&doi=10.1007%2fBF00235980&partnerID=40&md5=5c37720c972079f407eb2a7521a7ec89
GENRAD'S PC BOARD TESTER DOES IT ALL.,"With pc boards being loaded with a growing number of increasingly complex chips, testers must provide sophisticated timing analysis, enough random-access memory to store formidable test patterns, and the power to generate those patterns. A single board tester is considered that offers a wide variety of testing techniques to handle present and next-generation pc boards packed with every kind of the latest and most complicated chips; the GR2750 from GenRad Inc. This automatic test equipment can provide concurrent analog and digital testing in real time. For testing the newer, more complex digital components, the tester has 64-Kbits of RAM per pin. To test large RAMs, the 1750 has a new digital control unit found on the GR160 and 180 VLSI chip testers but not on any other board tester. This unit can generate an infinite number of test patterns to test the largest memories that can be manufactured.",McLeod Jonah,1987,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023366979&partnerID=40&md5=7a03dbcd868da21e03923a6b2d9e14d7
Mechanoreceptor response to mechanical and thermal stimuli in the glans penis of the dog,"In the dog, we isolated 126 mechano-receptive afferent fibers of the A-δ-myelinated fiber class from the dorsal nerve of the penis using microdissection and extracellular electrophysiological techniques. Receptive fields on the glans penis were stimulated with a computer-controlled mechanostimulator and Peltier effect thermostimulator. The great majority of units were categorized as either rapidly adapting (RA) or slowly adapting (SA) and were located primarily proximally and distally, respectively, on the glans. In comparison to values from other glabrous skin regions in other species, mean displacement and force thresholds of penile mechanoreceptors were high, whereas the mean velocity thresholds were low. SA units, generally poor encoders of static displacement, were distinguishable into two types based on static response firing pattern but were not homologous to either the SA I or SA II mechanoreceptors found in other skin regions. Fifty-five units were given simultaneous mechanical and thermal stimulation. Very few units responded to pure thermal stimulation or increased their discharge frequency to skin cooling. Warm receptive-field temperatures between 35 and 43°C increased mechanical sensitivity, measured by displacement and velocity coding functions, in almost all units tested. We conclude that canine penile mechanoreceptors, capable of encoding a variety of skin movements when the penis is warm, provide the spinal cord with the sensory input necessary to drive the spinal sexual reflexes. However, many appear to be at least physiologically different from mechanoreceptors native to other skin areas.","Johnson R.D., Kitchell R.L.",1987,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1987.57.6.1813,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023215391&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1987.57.6.1813&partnerID=40&md5=8ff87446d3ba87194e71b38b0a48c4ba
REDUNDANCY TEST FOR 1 MBIT DRAM USING MULTI-BIT-TEST MODE.,"A description is given of a method for reducing the redundancy test time using a multibit test (MBT) mode. A redundancy test carried out by laser trimming (LT) consists of a pre-LT test for detecting the failed addresses and laser trimming for repairing the failed bits. Increased testing time is generally caused by an increase of the pre-LT testing time, because the repair time is almost always constant, regardless of the memory bit density. To shorten the pre-LT test time, a 'fast test' such as a diagonal checker pattern is introduced in the first step of the testing process using a redundancy flag option. Six to 10 times greater throughput has been achieved.","Nishimura Y., Hamada M., Hidaka H., Ozaki H., Fujishima K., Hayasaka Y.",1986,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022915509&partnerID=40&md5=9a88e77ac60fbb33bbb10b08c6ed81ca
Rat Pineal Exhibits Two Electrophysiological Patterns of Response to Microiontophoretic Norepinephrine Application,"The spontaneous activity of 117 pineal units was recorded in urethane‐anesthetized rats. The pineal units exhibited a wide range of firing rates of which 50% were on average slower than 14 spikes per second. Superior cervical ganglion (SCG) stimulation was studied in 76 pineal units; this stimulation caused excitation in 55% of the units. Microiontophoretic application of norepinephrine (NE) induced changes of firing rates in 61% of the pineal units tested. Two patterns of activity following NE microiontophoresis was observed: increase in firing rate (64%) and decrease in firing rate (36%). NE‐induced excitation was observed only in those units excited by SCG stimulation. When NE and SCG stimulation were applied together, partial summation of the excitation induced by each one alone was observed. None of the units in which NE depressed the firing rate responded to SCG stimulation. Local application of propranolol blocked the excitation initiated by SCG stimulation as well as the excitation and the depression induced by NE microiontophoresis. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

"Response of rat paraventricular neurones with central projections to suckling, haemorrhage or osmotic stimuli","In lactating, urethane-anaesthetized female rats extracellular recordings were made from paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurones that were antidromically activated following electrical stimulation of the neurohypophysis, amygdala or nucleus tractus solitarius/vagal complex (NTS/VC). Of the PVN units, 98 projected to the neurohypophysis but none of these neurosecretory neurones were found to simultaneously project to extrahypothalamic areas. From the firing patterns and the response of these neurons to suckling, haemorrhage or osmotic stimuli both 'vasopressinergic' and 'oxytocinergic' neurones were identified. We found 43 PVN units to project to the NTS/VC and 22% of tested neurones were activated by osmotic or haemorrhage stimuli; no phasic activity was associated with this activation. The suckling stimulus failed to elicit any response from these units. Upon testing the PVN units that projected to the amygdala (n = 35), it was found that haemorrhage and suckling stimuli were without effect, while the osmotic stimulus activated one of 6 units tested. Thus, the extrahypothalamic PVN projections examined in this study were not associated with the suckling reflex response, although there is evidence for their limited involvement in neural response to osmotic or haemorrhage stimuli. © 1985.","Lawrence D., Pittman Q.J.",1985,Scopus,10.1016/0006-8993(85)91486-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022391763&doi=10.1016%2f0006-8993%2885%2991486-6&partnerID=40&md5=6e4745d50c1ef7c872c46e545cbdd06f
Long-loop reflexes in small hand muscles studied in normal subjects and in patients with huntington's disease,"Long-latency electromyographic (EMG) responses of the first dorsal interosseus muscle were evoked by short displacements of the index finger in healthy subjects and in patients with Huntington's disease (HD). In all 20 healthy subjects the early spinal response (mean latency 31.5 ms) was followed by a reproducible later reflex response with a mean latency of 56.5 ms. The activity pattern of single motor units of the stretched muscle was similar to that of the surface EMG. Thus all single motor units tested could be active during either the first or second response phase, but never in both in a given trial. Of the 50 patients with HD, the late EMG response was missing completely in all but 7, but the early spinal component was almost identical to that of the control group. Double stretches at an interval of 25 ms evoked two similar EMG responses in these patients, proving that the motoneuron pool is still excitable during the time at which the second response would have appeared in healthy subjects.The reflex responses of the thenar muscles evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve were examined during a voluntary opposing contraction of the thumb in both groups of subjects. In normal subjects, two EMG responses could be distinguished with latencies similar to those of the mechanically elicited responses. Patients with HD again lacked the second response, although the first spinal response was always present. The results are discussed with respect to different proposals concerning the origin of long-latency responses in human muscles. At least for distal hand muscles, the results suggest that the long-latency responses are long-loop reflexes. © 1985 Oxford University Press.","Noth J., Podoll K., Friedemann H.-H.",1985,Scopus,10.1093/brain/108.1.65,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0021946101&doi=10.1093%2fbrain%2f108.1.65&partnerID=40&md5=e0ea4845e5cc7381a355b6e1e06d4ef9
Failure of sympathetic stimulation to affect responsiveness of rabbit polymodal nociceptors,"1. The responses of polymodal nociceptors with unmyelinated (C) fibers of the rabbit's great auricular nerve were examined with and without intermittent stimulation of the ipsilateral cervical sympathetic trunk. The receptive field of each polymodal nociceptor was heated twice in a stepwise manner from 30 to 50 or 55°C in 5°C steps. For each unit, one heating trial was a control trial and the other was accompanied by sympathetic stimulation. The order of the control and sympathetic stimulation trials and the maximum testing temperature were varied systematically among the units examined. 2. The initial responses of polymodal nociceptors in the first heating trial in the presence of sympathetic stimulation were similar to the responses of units whose first heating was a control trial. Units whose receptive fields were tested to a maximum temperature of 50°C in the first trial displayed enhanced responses to heat in their second trial (sensitization), while units tested initially to 55°C responded less briskly during their second heating trial (depression). However, the occurrence of sympathetic stimulation in the second heating trials had no apparent effect on the responses to heat of sensitized or depressed elements. Alterations in the numbers of impulses, instantaneous frequency, or pattern of impulse activity of individual units could not be attributed to sympathetic stimulation. It was concluded that the heat sensitivity of C polymodal nociceptors is not modified by efferent sympathetic activity under the conditions examined in this study.","Shea V.K., Perl E.R.",1985,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1985.54.3.513,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0022397949&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1985.54.3.513&partnerID=40&md5=602a5d586c75036bb7d9415c3a5f8d9f
SELF-TESTING OF EMBEDDED RAMS.,"A design-for-testability method for embedded RAMs is presented. This method combines both self-test and scan techniques. A simple march test pattern is used in self-test to detect all hard failures in the RAMs. A scan technique is used to detect stuck-at and bridging faults in the comparator and data lines, and to diagnose single stuck-at faults in the RAMs. To obtain better fault coverage, a modified pseudo-random pattern generator is used as an address generator.

Suprachiasmatic neurons in tissue slices from ovariectomized rats: Electrophysiological and neuropharmacological characterization and the effects of estrogen treatment,"Single-unit activity and unit responses to putative neurotransmitters were recorded from suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neurons in brain tissue slices from ovariectomized rats either treated or untreated with estrogen. Altogether, 204 units were studied from estrogen-treated and untreated preparations, and at the resting state, 37% of these units fired regularly, 57% fired irregularly, and 6% were silent but evokable by electrical stimulation. Most of the irregular units fired continuously (n=100), while the rest fired intermittently (n=12) or phasically (n=4). Neurons with different types of firing patterns also varied significantly in resting firing rate and in responsiveness to transmitters and to estrogen treatment. The average resting firing rate decreased significantly from regular, irregular and continuous, intermittent, to silent units. Acetylcholine (ACh) and/or serotonin (5-HT) injected directly into the perfusion chamber evoked responses from more irregular (69% of 61 units) than regular units (20% of 46 units). None of the 5 silent units tested was activated by ACh or 5-HT. Responses to ACh (predominantly inhibitory) and 5-HT (predominantly excitatory) seen here in vitro were opposite to those observed in vivo with iontophoretic application, and were not reversed or abolished by the blockade of synaptic transmission. Comparisons of data between the two types of preparations showed that only the responsiveness of the irregular units to ACh and to 5-HT were significantly different: both types of responsiveness were higher in estrogen-treated than in untreated preparations. No significant difference was found in the responsiveness of regular units, or in firing patterns or firing rate. Thus, the present in vitro studies have demonstrated that SCN contains a heterogeneous population of neurons distinguishable by their electrophysiological and neuropharmacological characteristics, and that estrogen has a specific action on specic types of SCN neurons. © 1984.","Kow L.-M., Pfaff D.W.",1984,Scopus,10.1016/0006-8993(84)90568-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0021272452&doi=10.1016%2f0006-8993%2884%2990568-7&partnerID=40&md5=8f17f588559fcad54404a1728484a863
Characterization of recirculating lymphocytes in rheumatoid arthritis patients: Selective deficiency of natural killer cells in thoracic duct lymph,"Five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who were treated by lymphocyte depletion by using thoracic duct drainage (TDD), provided an opportunity to characterize the phenotype and function of their recirculating lymphocytes. We found that: a) thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL) were similar in their proportion of T cells (83% ± 6 OKT3+), OKT4+ subset (65% ± 8), and OKT8+ subset (22% ± 6) to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL); b) fewer natural killer-like cells were present in TDL (5% ± 4 Leu-7+; 2% ± 2 Leu-11+, 8% ± 2 OKM-1+) than in PBL (20% ± 10 Leu-7+; 11% ± 6 Leu-11+, 18% ± 5 OKM-1) (p &lt; 0.01); c) TDL differed from synovial fluid lymphocytes (SFL) and synovial membrane lymphocytes (SML) in that TDL lacked a high percentage of activated lymphocytes (T cells bearing Ia antigen, OKT10, and transferrin receptor); d) immature T cells (expressing either OKT6 antigen or reactive with peanut agglutinin) were not found in TDL even late in the course of TDD; and e) in vitro functional studies demonstrated that TDL were similar to PBL in their ability to synthesize immunoglobulin after mitogen stimulation and to generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes capable of lysing autologous EBV-transformed B cells. However, natural killer activity, as measured by lysis of K562 cells, was significantly lower in TDL than PBL (p &lt; 0.05). These results demonstrate that natural killer cells defined by phenotype and function are excluded from thoracic duct lymph and thus have a circulation pattern different from most T cells.","Fox R.I., Fong S., Tsoukas C., Vaughan J.H.",1984,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0021259315&partnerID=40&md5=16da47ed98f99e51f976161668411ccc
Single-unit responses to cholinergic agents in the rat inferior colliculus,"Single units were recorded from the inferior colliculi of adult male rats anesthetized with urethane. Units were driven with tonal stimuli, and changes in unit responses to the tones were monitored during iontophoretic application of cholinergic drugs. The cholinergic agonists acetylcholine and carbamylcholine potentiated responses in about 50% and suppressed responses in about 35% of units tested. Cholinergic antagonists typically produced effects when delivered alone. Both d-tubocurarine and atropine methyl nitrate excited over 80% of units tested, while mecamylamine and scopolamine inhibited the majority of tested units. Dihydro-beta-erythroidine was generally ineffective. Alpha-bungarotoxin was generally ineffective when delivered alone, but blocked agonist effects. Post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) patterns, response-intensity functions and response areas were examined for changes during drug delivery. Cholinergic agents did not differentially affect either time periods within the PSTH or frequency bands of response areas, but were especially effective for those intensities producing larger response rates. Taken together with evidence from biochemical studies, our results suggest the presence of a functional cholinergic input into the inferior colliculus which acts to modulate acoustic processing. © 1983.","Farley G.R., Morley B.J., Javel E., Gorga M.P.",1983,Scopus,10.1016/0378-5955(83)90046-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020577117&doi=10.1016%2f0378-5955%2883%2990046-1&partnerID=40&md5=ba278f1455a83f07a4283f7f791ede29
Neural correlates of cubic difference tones in the medial geniculate body of the cat,"Single unit responses to the cubic difference tone CDT (2f1 - f2 = CF) and the difference tone DT (f2 - f1 = CF) were studied in the medial geniculate body (MGB) of the cat.

The component tones when presented alone evoked no responses, or in some cases a response pattern that was different from the one observed for the combination tone. The CDT response pattern was always similar to that seen for a pure tone at the CF. The threshold of response for the CDT was 10-70 dB higher than for a pure tone stimulus at the CF.

Effects of norepinephrine and serotonin upon spontaneous activity and responses to mossy fiber stimulation of CA3 neurons in hippocampal slices,"Effects of norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) upon spontaneous activity and responses to mossy fiber stimulation (mfs) were tested in 192 units of the field CA3 in the guinea pig and rat hippocampal slices. The drugs were added to the incubating medium or ejected by pressure from a micropipette. After NE superfusion firing rate increased in 52% of the reactive units, while activity of 48% was suppressed. The direction of the effect strongly correlated with pattern of spontaneous activity: only the cells with 'complex discharges' (short bursts of 2-4 spikes with attenuation of amplitude) were suppressed by NE; the cells with single spikes increased the level activity. Similar excitatory effects of NE were observed in all units (n = 14) with single spike activity recorded in the field CA1. 5-HT increased activity in 30% of the reactive units and suppressed it in 70% of them. Some of the cells which were suppressed by 5-HT, were excited by NE. In more than a half of the units tested, 5-HT led to prolonged (up to 30-40 min) increase of the level of background activity irrespective of the initial excitatory or suppressive action; periodic grouped discharges appeared in some units under the influence of 5-HT. The response to mfs usually changed in the same direction as the level of background activity during application of NE and 5-HT, though some exceptions were observed in both cases.

EPROM testing - part I: Theoretical considerations,"Testing may be more expensive for EPROMs than for other memories, because program and erasure cycles are much longer than read cycles, and therefore the test procedure must not include more than one program and one erasure step. In this paper EPROM operation is modeled by a sequential machine whose state and output equations are derived according to boolean matrix algebra. The choice and the effectiveness of the patterns used to fill the memory are discussed, with reference to appropriate fault models. Two kinds of faults are considered: ""stuck-at"" bits in the memory matrix and ""symmetric decoder faults"", i.e. faults which cause the same behaviour during READ and PROGRAM operations. The nature of the faults which may escape the proposed sequence of test patterns is determined by analytical considerations, and qualitative results on fault detection effectiveness are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. © 1982 Pergamon Press Ltd.","Alliney S., Fantini F., Morandi C.",1982,Scopus,10.1016/S0026-2714(82)80465-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020340734&doi=10.1016%2fS0026-2714%2882%2980465-4&partnerID=40&md5=58293dd4a181c0f5d52980c38b879f84
Responses of cat corneal sensory receptors to mechanical and thermal stimulation.,"1. The afferent responses evoked by mechanical and thermal stimulation of the cat cornea were recorded extracellularly from strands of long and mixed ciliary nerves under deep anaesthesia. 94% of the units studied (n = 53) responded consistently to both stimuli. 2. Conduction velocities, measured by electrical stimulation of the receptive field, corresponded to the lower range of the A‐delta fibre group (average = 5.4 m/sec). Receptive fields covered approximately a quadrant of the corneal surface and showed continuous sensitivity and overlapping. Units were silent in the absence of stimulation but an ongoing activity was commonly present after repeated mechanical and thermal stimulation. 3. Mechanical responses were evoked at low thresholds and consisted of a dynamic and static response that paralleled the amplitude of the stimulus. The pattern of the discharge was irregular and fatigue was easily developed by repeated stimulation. 4. Thresholds to heating were above 38 degrees C and the response increased monotonically with the temperature over the range from threshold to 50 degrees C. The heat response could be sensitized by repeated long suprathreshold stimulation while variable changes in the response were induced by briefer stimuli. Also depression was observed in some circumstances. A weak response to cooling was present in 50% of the units tested. 5. Damaging mechanical stimulation or the application of a strong acid solution evoked a vigorous response followed by an earlier discharge that persisted for hours. 6.

Projections from areas 17 and 18 of the visual cortex to the nucleus of the optic tract,"The corticofugal pathway to the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT) in the cat was studied with visual and electrical stimulation in two experimental series. In 10 experiments cells in the NOT were identified, and orthodromic responses evoked by single electric shocks applied through microelectrodes situated at different loci in areas 17 and 18. All but 2 units gave clear responses to shocks applied to either cortical electrode. The mean of response latencies was calculated to be 3.29 ms for area 17 stimulation and 3.04 ms for area 18 stimulation. In 8 further experiments the stimulation and recording sites were reversed; i.e. single shocks through microelectrodes in the NOT were used to elicit antidromic discharges in areas 17 and 18. A third microelectrode was placed in the superior colliculus (SC) at a position in retinotopic register with the units recorded at the NOT stimulation site. Out of 231 cortical units tested, 42 (17%) gave an antidromic response to NOT and/or SC shock. Seventeen units responded both to NOT and SC stimulation, 18 to NOT alone, and 7 to SC alone. The response latencies after NOT shock (mean 2.8 ± 1.5 S.D.) did not differ significantly from those to SC shock (2.9 ms ± 1.5 S.D.). All cortical cells activated antidromically from NOT and/or SC were located in layer V of areas 17 and 18. These units showed the following response characteristics: they responded well to conventional light bars as well as to large area random dot patterns; they were binocular and showed direction tuning; as compared to NOT cells they were more sharply tuned for stimulus velocity preferring faster movements. The present findings suggest a convergent projection to the NOT from the same type of cortical cells that project to the superior colliculus. © 1981.",Schoppmann A.,1981,Scopus,10.1016/0006-8993(81)90802-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0019410846&doi=10.1016%2f0006-8993%2881%2990802-7&partnerID=40&md5=72651f5b957196b972d7391eee7079a1
Patterns of activity evoked in cerebellar interpositus nuclear neurones by natural somatosensory stimuli in awake cats,"1. Stable extracellular unitary recordings were made from 138 cerebellar interpositus nuclear neurones (IPNs) in awake cats. Mean background discharge, in animals in a state of relaxed wakefulness and in the absence of overt movement, was 41·0±2·6 impulses/sec (mean± s.e.m). 2. Animals were trained to accept a variety of sensory testing procedures without producing detectable motor reactions. Mechanical taps (1 mm amplitude; 20 msec overall duration) applied to the main pads or dorsal surfaces of the forepaws and/or hind paws modified discharge in forty‐eight of 110 IPNs tested. Response patterns to taps generally comprised one or more of three basic components, namely: short‐latency excitation, e1, at onset latencies of 13·0±0·9 msec (mean± s.e.m.) for ipsilateral forepaw (iF) and 17·0±0·7 msec for ipsilateral hind paw (iH); a period of reduced discharge, at latencies 25·6±2·6 msec for iF and 32·3±2·1 msec for iH; a delayed acceleration of discharge, e2, at latencies 47·4±4·6 msec for iF and 46·4±4·1 msec for iH. The component e1 was the most common (present in 80% of responses) and e2 the least common (present in 18% of responses). 3. The majority (&gt; 70%) of responses of IPNs to tap stimulation of the paws comprised net excitation. 4. Convergence of tap‐evoked sensory input from iF and iH on to individual IPNs was evident in eight of the thirty‐five units tested with stimulation of both afferent sites. 5. Approximately one third of IPNs so tested were sensitive to passive manipulation of limb joints in the quiet, awake cat. Sixteen of the forty‐three IPNs so tested responded to displacement of the ipsilateral wrist and/or elbow joints and three of ten IPNs so tested responded to movement of contralateral forepaw joints. Corresponding proportions of IPNs responding to passive ankle and/or knee joint displacements were sixteen of thirty‐six units tested and three of three units tested for ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws respectively. Convergence of input generated by manipulation of iF and iH joints on to individual IPNs was apparent in only three of twenty‐four units tested at each site. 6. Tactile stimulation (brushing fur, gentle pressure on the skin) of iF influenced discharge in twelve of thirty‐seven IPNs tested and comparable iH‐related cutaneous sensory fields were found for fourteen of twenty‐eight IPNs tested. 7. The modulations of discharge of IPNs associated with active movements of the stimulated limb were usually far more pronounced than those elicited by somatosensory stimulation in the quiet, relaxed animal. 8. Responses of IPNs to natural somatosensory stimulation in the awake cat are compared with those previously described for anaesthetized or decerebrate preparations and with those found for electrical stimulation of cutaneous nerves in awake cats. In general IPN response patterns to precisely timed tap stimulation of the paws in the awake animal closely resembled those that would have been predicted from the earlier studies, although the time course of responses differed in certain respects. © 1981 The Physiological Society","Cody F.W.J., Moore R.B., Richardson H.C.",1981,Scopus,10.1113/jphysiol.1981.sp013810,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0019731396&doi=10.1113%2fjphysiol.1981.sp013810&partnerID=40&md5=1bbe5d731e225b4f91d83a0313a875a0
Responses of lateral reticular neurons to convergent neck and macular vestibular inputs,"Convergence of neck and macular vestibular inputs within the lateral reticular nucleus (NRL) and the lateral aspect of the main reticular formation (RF) of the medulla has been investigated in decerebrate cats following sinusoidal rotation around the longitudinal axis either of the body only, while maintaining the head stationary (neck input), or of the whole animal (macular input). Finally, both neck and macular inputs were elicited by rotating the head, while the body remained fixed in the horizontal position. Among the 102 lateral reticular units tested at the frequency of rotation of 0.026 Hz (5-10° peak amplitude), 51 units (i.e., 50%) responded to both neck and macular inputs, 10 units (9.8%) responded to the neck inputs only, 7 units (6.9%) to the macular input only, while the remaining 34 units (33.3%) were unresponsive to either type of stimulation. The first harmonic of responses to the neck input and the macular input showed an average phase lead of about +38° with respect to neck position and +14° with respect to animal position. The sensitivity of the units, expressed in percentage changes of the mean firing rate per degree of displacement, corresponded on the average to 5.5 ± 5.1 (SD) for the neck responses and 3.2 ± 2.8 (SD) for the macular responses. Two distinct populations of neurons were observed. The first group of units (36/48, i.e., 75%) received reciprocal influences from neck and macular receptors. These units were mainly excited during side-down neck rotation, but were inhibited during side-down tilt of the whole animal. The sensitivity of the neck responses was only slightly higher than that of the macular responses. In contrast, the second group of units (12/48, i.e., 25%) received parallel influences from the two types of receptors. These units were mainly excited during both side-up neck rotation and side-up tilt of the whole animal. The sensitivity of the neck responses within this group was much higher than that of the macular responses. The first population of units received a somatosensory input from the hindlimbs, which was not the case for the other one. Moreover, the first group of units was distributed within the whole extent of the NRL, while the second group was concentrated in the dorsomedial, magnocellular part of this nucleus. The response characteristics of lateral reticular neurons to the combined neck and macular inputs, elicited during head rotation, closely corresponded to those obtained under the assumption of a vectorial summation of the individual neck and macular responses. In particular, the units that showed a reciprocal pattern of convergence displayed small amplitudes and large phase leads of the responses with respect to head position, when both types of receptors were simultaneously stimulated. In contrast, the units that showed a parallel pattern of convergence displayed large amplitude and small phase leads during head rotation. The functional significance of these two populations of neurons is discussed in relation to the known tonic effects of neck and macular vestibular inputs on the limb, neck, and extrinsic eye musculature.","Kubin L., Manzoni D., Pompeiano O.",1981,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1981.46.1.48,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0019404455&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1981.46.1.48&partnerID=40&md5=fca28112e20932f7c89468e8920f170d
Inhibitory action of vagal nerve and spinal cord afferents on discharge pattern of bulbar respiratory modulated neurons,"Single vagal nerve stimuli delivered during the burst discharge of respiratory modulated neurons entailed the lengthening of an interspike interval in 37% of all units tested. Occasionally stimuli delivered to the spinal cord caused lengthening of interspike intervals in respiratory modulated neurons and in other bulbar units, the discharge of which was not modulated with respiration. Vagal stimuli often entailed lengthening of the following interspike interval, while the interval during which stimuli were applied remained unaltered; latencies suggested that inhibitory pathways were polysynaptic. In expiratory-inspiratory (EI) and inspiratory (I) neurons, lengthenings of intervals roughly doubled those noted in inspiratory-expiratory (IE) and expiratory (E) units. Lengthening of intervals depended on the stimulus incidence within the intervals and was greatest when the stimuli were delivered during the late part of the intervals. In EI and I units the lengthening of the intervals occurred mainly during the middle part of the burst discharge; in IE and E neurons, however, they occurred towards the end of the burst. The conditioning of the discharge of respiratory modulated neurons could be demonstrated.","Dinse H.R.O., Boehmer G., Fallert M., Bittner A.",1980,Scopus,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0019303716&partnerID=40&md5=adce11d22e2e2698b2a243071a6c1017
Firing characteristics of neurons mediating optokinetic responses to rat's vestibular neurons,"1) The responses of single units in the pretectum (Pt) and in the n. reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) to constant velocity horizontal rotation (0.25-60 deg/s) of a large-field visual pattern were studied in immobilized, non-anesthetized DA-HAN rats. In addition, responses of Pt and NRTP neurons to pure vestibular stimuli (rotation in the dark) were studied. 2) Pt neurons showed seven response types to optokinetic stimulation (Table 1). The most frequent response (48%) consisted of a very rapid increase in firing to steady state on temporonasal motion stimulation of the contralateral eye; nasotemporal stimuli yielded no change in resting rate as did stimulation of the ipsilateral eye. The response maximum occurred at a retinal slip velocity of 1 deg/s. None of the Pt units tested responded to pure vestibular stimuli. 3) NRTP neurons - as Pt units - most frequently (43%) increased their discharge rate on temporonasal stimulation of the contralateral eye and maintained a constant resting rate during nasotemporal motion. Peak response amplitudes also occurred with retinal slip velocities of 1 deg/s. Contrary to the fast time-to-peak of the responses of Pt neurons NRTP units showed a slow rise in frequency of firing to peak response levels. 4) NRTP neurons responded to pure vestibular stimuli (horizontal angular acceleration in the dark). The vestibular responses were synergistic with those evoked in the same neurons by optokinetic stimuli. Thus, the most frequently encountered type of optokinetic response (s. above) showed a type II vestibular response. 5) Comparison of OKN and Vn optokinetic responses with those of Pt and NRTP suggests that the unidirectional-selective Pt and NRTP neurons are important links in the central optokinetic path. In addition, the NRTP may represent the site at which the retinal slip signal and the eye velocity signal converge. This convergence has been postulated in models of the system [12]. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.","Cazin L., Precht W., Lannou J.",1980,Scopus,10.1007/BF00587472,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0018832850&doi=10.1007%2fBF00587472&partnerID=40&md5=d5a2ebf96f26611957594c60726a1598
Electrophysiological studies of neurons in the ventral tegmental area of tsai,"Extracellular recordings were obtained from single neurons in the ventral tegmental area of rats anesthetized with urethane. It was found that the area appeared to contain two groups of neurons with distinctly different spike durations, firing rates and firing patterns. One group (group A) had properties similar to those of nigral dopaminergic neurons: slow random firing rates, unusually long spike durations and slow conduction velocities. The discharge rate of the majority of these neurons was reduced by iontophoretically applied dopamine. It was concluded that neurons of this group were probably A10 dopaminergic neurons. The other group (group B) had relatively faster and rhythmical firing rates, short spike durations and faster conduction velocities and were considered to be non-dopaminergic. Forty-nine units in the ventral tegmental area were antidromically activated by electrical stimulation of the nucleus accumbens. Units antidromically activated included neurons of group A and group B, suggesting that the nucleus accumbens received dual projections of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic fibres from the ventral tegmental area. The discharge rate of 141 out of 142 neurons tested in the ventral tegmental area (group A: 66/66, group B: 75/76) was found to be reduced by GABA. The inhibition was blocked by the simultaneous application of picrotoxin. Picrotoxin alone activated 47.7% of 155 units tested. These results provide further evidence of a GABAergic input to dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons projecting to the limbic forebrain structures. © 1980.","Chi Yiu Yim, Mogenson G.J.",1980,Scopus,10.1016/0006-8993(80)90614-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0018877515&doi=10.1016%2f0006-8993%2880%2990614-9&partnerID=40&md5=8cc6339216c14685bf80872fdbea3c74
Torque and volumetric output of hydromotors indicate weak spots.,"The torque and the volumetric displacement of hydraulic motors are largely dependent on the type of construction and also to some extent on the individual unit. Test results are reported based on a series of measurements with a hydraulic motor test rig, which provide a detailed insight into the performance of various motor types, including radial piston, and axial piston motors of both inclined plate and inclined axis patterns. For a complete description of motor characteristics during slow running a knowledge of the manner in which volume changes with angular displacement is necessary in addition to torque changes. In particular changes occurring at the moment of reversal are demonstrated, while with the aid of special sensors and data recording systems traces can be obtained which indicate the variation of torque and volume flow during successive 360SUP rotations.

An antagonism between 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine in thermally responsive units in the rabbit hypothalamus,"One hundred and eight single units in the preoptic anterior hypothalamic region were examined in 25 urethan-anesthetized rabbits in this study. When these units were classified by their thermal responsiveness, the proportions of thermallyunresponsive, warm-responsive, and cold-responsive units were 52.8, 38.9, and 8.3%, respectively, of the total units studied. The proportion of the thermally responsive units responding to intraventricular administration of both 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) was very high, from 78.6% of the warm-responsive units to 100% of the cold-responsive units. In no case did both 5-HT and NE affect the activity of the thermally unresponsive units tested. In addition, more than 52% of the total population of the warm-responsive units were depressed by NE but excited by 5-HT application. Twenty-six percent of the total population of the warm-responsive units displayed a different pattern; each unit was excited by NE but was depressed by 5-HT. The remainder (21.4%) showed no antagonism between these two amines. Furthermore, 66.7% of the total cold-responsive units showed an excitation in response to NE but an inhibition to 5-HT. The remainder (33.3%) of the cold-responsive untis showed inhibition to NE but excitation to 5-HT application. The data demonstrate that there exists an antagonism between 5-HT and NE in thermally responsive units in the rabbit hypothalamus. © 1980.",Lin M.-T.,1980,Scopus,10.1016/0014-4886(80)90130-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0018907921&doi=10.1016%2f0014-4886%2880%2990130-2&partnerID=40&md5=6a7dc610a9d1804843c7e4e35177b2bb
Responses in the diagonal band of Broca evoked by stimulation of the fornix in the cat.,"1. Field potentials were recorded within the boundaries of the septal component of the diagonal band of Broca following stimulation of the fornix. The position of the recording electrode was marked by pressure injection of Alcian blue dye. 2. Stimulation of the medial aspect of the ipsilateral fornix produced a simple field caudally consisting of a short duration, short latency negative wave (N1) and a later small prolonged positive wave (P1). It is suggested that N1 is due to antidromic activation of the cells and P1 to their recurrent inhibition. 3. In the rostral part of the septal component of the diagonal band of Broca the field pattern was more complex, containing, in addition to N1 and P1, further negative waves, N2 and N3. N2 was compounded of antidromically and synaptically evoked components and N3 was associated with monosynaptic excitation of the cells. 4. Stimulation of the lateral margin of the fornix was shown to excite antidromically and synaptically the same cells as were excited by stimulation of the medial aspect of the fornix. 5. Stimulation of the medial and lateral aspects of contralateral fornix generated positive waves of similar character to P1. 6. Intracarotid injection of hyperosmotic saline solution caused behavioural signs of arousal and inhibition of spontaneous discharge in a third of the units tested. Spontaneously discharging units (mean frequency +/‐ S.E. of mean, 13.4 +/‐ 1.8, n = 55) were inhibited by stimulation of the medial and lateral ipsilateral and contralateral fornix. It is suggested that inhibitory interneurones receive contra‐ and ipsilateral input. Units with these characteristics were found. 7. The septal component of the diagonal band of Broca was compared with other septal nuclei and found to resemble them in its rostral portion in that it has a reciprocal relationship with ventral and dorsal hippocampus.

"Thin‐fibre receptors responding to mechanical, chemical, and thermal stimulation in the skeletal muscle of the dog","1. Unitary activities of muscular thin fibre afferents, which were not sensitive to muscle stretching, were recorded from the nerve of the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the dog. Responses to mechanical stimulation, intra‐arterial injection and local application of chemical solutions, and thermal stimulation of the surface of the muscle were studied. It was observed that polymodal receptors which responded to all types of stimulation existed in the thin fibre afferents of the muscle. 2. The receptive area of these units tested by mechanical stimulation was spot‐like and appeared to be located not only on the surface but in the midst of the muscle. 3. The mechanical response varied among these units with respect to the threshold and the pattern of discharges. 4. In these units, NaCl, KCl, and bradykinin consistently evoked responses, with differences in the latencies and discharge patterns, while solutions of histamine, acetylcholine and sodium citrate caused responses less consistently and less effectively. In the stretch receptors, chemical stimulation applied in the same way as tested in the thin fibre afferents produced quite different features in their responses. 5. Heating the receptive area of the muscle surface caused responses in twenty‐five out of thirty‐six units, which were sensitive both to mechanical and to chemical stimulations. The threshold varied from 38·0 to 48·3 °C, with a mean of 43·1 °C for C fibre units and 41 °C for A‐δ fibre units. 6. The responses to heating were consistently obtained in the units responding to the surface application of chemical solutions. However, the above response was never obtained in the units which did not respond to surface chemical stimulation but responded to intra‐arterial injection.

WHEN TESTING 16-k DYNAMIC RAMS.,"Two considerations important to random-access memory testing are temperature effects and adequate test-pattern sequences. Storage time, access time, power dissipation, and input/output levels all need to be verified over the applicable temperature range.

Neuronal responses to eye muscle stretch in cerebellar lobule VI of the cat,"Extraocular proprioceptive input to cerebellar vermis, lobule VI, was investigated in cats under N2O analgesia by recording neuronal responses to eye muscle stretch. Both optic tracts were transected and the periorbital skin and conjunctiva were locally anaesthetized. Eye rotation within the physiological range was achieved by applying a pull of predetermined length and tension to each of the eight musculi recti at their insertion to the globe. Within lobule VI, only small patches of cortex receive stretch receptor afferents. The information made available by these afferents corresponds to a change of eye position. Minimal responses were dependent upon angular deflections of a few degrees. Maximal response amplitudes were obtained within the physiological range of angular deflections and angular velocities for the units tested. Most cells responded to stretch of more than one muscle. Three types of convergence were found: (1) neurons responding according to a certain direction of a conjugated movement of both eyes, (2) neurons responding to movements in either direction of one plane, (3) more complicated response patterns. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.","Schwarz D.W.F., Tomlinson R.D.",1977,Scopus,10.1007/BF00234828,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0017353295&doi=10.1007%2fBF00234828&partnerID=40&md5=b784b20acf13cd13c223240cfc47ec64
"Directional coding by binaural brainstem units of the CF-FM bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum","1. Monaural and binaural neurophysiological data were obtained from 264 units in the medullary and mesencephalic levels of the central auditory system in the CF-FM bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, using earphones for acoustically separated stimulation of the two ears. 2. The units responded to pure tones delivered at their best frequencies with typical basic patterns (PST-histograms) which were classified according to the literature. 3. The latencies of the units' responses changed systematically with the recording depth from about 8 to 1.5ms when passing from the inferior colliculus at the brain's surface through the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus down to the superior olivary complex. 4. Best frequencies covered almost the whole hearing range from 2kHz up to 96kHz, but 50% of all units lay between 75 and 85kHz, the animal's best hearing range, the emission frequency of orientation sounds being between 82 and 84kHz (CF-part). 5. All lowest thresholds of single units put together demonstrate an almost perfect fitting with the behavioural hearing curve. 6. Monaural excitatory impulse count functions were mostly monotonic but many were very non-monotonic and intermediate. 7. The binaural classification (Table 1) confirmed the classical concept of the pathway and the theory of binaural interaction. The most frequently observed types were E/I (ipsilateral inhibitory, contralateral excitatory; 53 %) and E/E (both sides excitatory; 22%). 8. In all cases tested so far, best frequencies and tuning curves were the same for both sides regardless of the kind of binaural interaction. 9. The most interesting units found (13% of the total) showed together with binaural inhibition, strong facilitation in certain ranges of their dynamic range thus reinforcing the response to particular stimulus combinations. These units may be called directional specialists, useful for angular sensitivity. 10. The excitatory impulse count functions were usually steep covering a best dynamic range of 10-30dB, whereas inhibitory curves were much flatter but covered a wide dynamic range of 30-100dB. 11. Since therefore the excitatory influence is always predominant in any unit tested, coding of the sound direction is ambiguous when the absolute intensity is altered. Hence the response is not only a function of the interaural intensity difference as postulated by the theory, but also dependent upon absolute intensity levels. Neural mechanisms to compensate such ambiguities in presumably higher centers are postulated and discussed. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.",Schlegel P.,1977,Scopus,10.1007/BF00614354,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000181201&doi=10.1007%2fBF00614354&partnerID=40&md5=bf3739de504239093e0f94c4bc588134
Radiation test and simulation of CMOS/SOS/Si-GATE ALU and ROM devices,"This paper presents the results of transient radiation tests on a Carry-Look-Ahead Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), the computer simulation of the transient response of this ALU device, and a proposed transient radiation-hardened design for a Read Only Memory (ROM). Experimental results demonstrate the validity of “simple SOS device predictions of failure levels for the more complex ALU devices. ALU samples were fabricated with four types of insulators; namely: Al2O3, ion-implanted SiO2, dry SiO2, and wet SiO2 These devices were specially made to investigate total dose hardness and to check the transient hardness of the fabrication on a sapphire substrate. Circuit design and sizing rules to achieve transient hardness were not utilized. Devices were exposed to 10-MeV electron pulses of 20 and 100 ns in a static and an active mode, with inputs activated by six basic test patterns. Upset failure did not occur in the 20-ns pulse tests for all exposure conditions and dose rates up to and including the maximum rate of 1.3 x 1010 rads (Si)/s. The 100-ns pulse tests indicate that the failure level is 3.5 x 1010 rads (si)/s, whereas the pass level is rads (Si)/s. The worst-case exposure conditions are the static mode of operation with the chip outputs in a high state. In order to explain the test results, a simple circuit model of a limited part of the chip output circuit was derived for the static mode of operation and output high. Using the RCA Circuit Analysis Program (R-CAP), the circuit was simulated using pulse and linear current sources for 100-ns pulse duration. Simulation results indicate that failure occurs when the photocurrents are 65 and for the two types of sources, respectively. These correspond to normalized conductances of mhos/mil-rad/s and mhos/mil-rad/s. Using the ALU test results and the ALU computer simulation for the transient radiation response, a Complementary Metal-Oxide semiconductor Silicon-On-Sapphire (CMOS/ SOS), 1024-Bit Read Only Memory currently under development by RCA was analyzed to determine its transient hardness level. The analysis, using RCA computer simulations, suggested several design rules involving both logic design and device size which will increase the upset failure levels by factors of 2 to 15, but at the expense of speed and chip area.

Response of unmyelinated (C) polymodal nociceptors to thermal stimuli applied to monkey's face,"The response of C polymodal nociceptors to thermal and mechanical stimuli applied to the monkey's face was recorded extracellularly in the trigeminal ganglion in rhesus monkeys anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Conduction velocities, determined from electrical stimulation of receptive fields (RFs), were in the range for unmyelinated C fibers (mean=0.82 m/s,n=20;SD=±0.17). With two exceptions cutaneous RFs were single spots (median = 2 mm2; n=37) and usually were identical for thermal and mechanical stimuli. The median force threshold for the sample of units was 1.2 g (von Frey technique; n = 39; range = 0.07-8.5 g). Discharges to thermal stimuli were investigated with a feedback controlled contact thermode which permitted temperature changes ≤12.0°C/s. Thermal thresholds ranged from 38° to 49°C (median=46°C; n=37), and maximum discharge frequencies were obtained in the noxious heat range (45-55°C). For a graded series of 5 s duration stimuli from an adapting temperature of 35°C, the number of impulses increased as a monotonic function of stimulus intensity over the range from threshold temperature to 50-53°C. Many stimulus response functions were positively accelerated and linear regression analyses showed that most units examined were best fit by nonlinear functions. The typical pattern of activity to 5 s duration temperature shifts into the noxious heat range was a short accelerating burst of impulses followed by deceleration to a lower rate of discharge prior to termination of the stimulus. The temporal profile of the discharge of impulses was virtually identical at different adapting temperatures. In units tested with 30 s duration stimuli at 2-6°C above threshold, the mean frequency of discharge during the final 25 s was 1.46 impulses/s (n=6; SD=±0.89). Application of noxious heat stimuli a few degrees above threshold temperature typically sensitized or enhanced the response of the unit to subsequent application of heat stimuli. The signs of sensitization consisted of a decrease in threshold temperature, increased frequency of discharge, decreased latency to the first impulse, and afterdischarges. Units failed to respond throughout the duration of 30 s stimuli if the final temperature exceeded 50°C. Depressed responses were sometimes produced by application of intense (≥55°C) stimuli, presumably as a result of partial inactivation of the receptor. In a correlative analysis, the latency and pattern of discharge in a sample of units were compared with escape responses in two monkeys to temperature shifts into the noxious heat range (49 and 51°C). The analysis revealed that the discharge of C polymodal nociceptors alone cannot account for fast escape responses, but the discharge may contribute to escape responses which occur more than 3.5 s after the onset of stimulation.","Beitel R.E., Dubner R.",1976,Scopus,10.1152/jn.1976.39.6.1160,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0017031324&doi=10.1152%2fjn.1976.39.6.1160&partnerID=40&md5=5c386bf48f4f9ba36fb099bf4e969313

Neuronal activity during eye movements in a visual association area of cat cerebral cortex,"270 single neurons from the anterior part of the middle suprasylvian gyrus (AMSS) were recorded in awake and non-paralyzed cats (Chronic preparation). 10% were unresponsive to visual stimulation, the remainder reacted well to moving visual stimuli. Half of the units tested were directionally selective. Horizontal, or downward preferred directions predominated. Most neurons were relative insensitive to changes of shape, orientation, contrast, and velocity of the visual stimulus. Some neurons preferred rapid (100°/sec) jerky movements, others required complex motions of irregular shapes, a few strongly preferred objects moving towards the animal in the midsagittal plane. 40% of neurons yielded phasic On-Off reaction to flashing stationary spots. Habituation to repeated stimulation was a common feature and occured in 50% of AMSS neurons. In 19% of neurons tested the discharge rate was not affected by saccadic eye movements, when the animal faced a patterned background. Among the remainder two types of saccade associated responses could be distinguished. Type I discharged prior to or simultaneously with the onset of saccades. This early response was usually associated with saccades of particular directions. Saccades in total darkness yielded weaker and less consistent responses. Type II discharged subsequent to the onset of the saccades after a latency of 40 msec (type IIa), 40-80 msec (type IIb) and 80 msec (type IIc). Responses of type IIa are probably consequences of the retinal effects of eye movements. The saccade associated responses of type Ia, IIb and IIc are tentatively interpreted as results of an eye movement-synchroneous subcortical input, which facilitates transmission in AMSS neurons. Presaccadic facilitation, which generates type Ia responses, may be functionally related to shifts of attention prior to eye movements. It is suggested that postsaccadic facilitation, which underlies the reactions of type IIb and IIc, may be a correlate of visual attention during the fixation period. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.","Straschill M., Schick F.",1974,Scopus,10.1007/BF00236111,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0015950066&doi=10.1007%2fBF00236111&partnerID=40&md5=77209f278d5618a27705cb54df4d9e72
Single unit and evoked potential responses in cat optic tract to paired light flashes,"Single unit responses and gross evoked potentials were recorded in the optic tract of cats under barbiturate anesthesia in response to single and paired flashes of light. Parallels were drawn between the evoked potentials recorded in this study and those recorded in previous work in alert, behaving cats during perceptual discrimination of paired from single flashes. Comparability of the evoked potentials under the two conditions served as justification for correlating patterns of single unit responses and perceptual responses to pairs of flashes. Under light adaptation, unit recovery to paired flashes at various interflash intervals was comparable to evoked potential recovery and, hence, to the perceptual responses in only about one-half of the units tested. In contrast, under dark adapted conditions, only one-third of the units paralleled the evoked potentials. Thus, a large number of retinal units apparently fail to play a significant role in temporal discrimination of paired from single flashes. The discussion focuses upon the relationship between unit and perceptual responses and considers alternative ways in which information necessary for discrimination of paired from single flashes may be coded. © 1973 Springer-Verlag.","Peck C.K., Lindsley D.B.",1973,Scopus,10.1007/BF00233429,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0015937880&doi=10.1007%2fBF00233429&partnerID=40&md5=c9c64b5a37702ce1732c68844e865963

A comparison of student achievement and retention on subjective versus objective social studies examinations as influenced by different instructional patterns,"In addition to a comparison of student achievement on different types of examinations, changes in student attitudes toward the social studies mini-course as influenced by a particular instructional pattern were measured, and student attitudes concerning the teacher’s performance as a result of a particular instructional pattern were compared between treatments. The investigation included three groups: Two experimental groups-pupil-centric instructional pattern and teacher-centric instructional pattern; and a control group-combination pupil-centric and teacher-centric instructional pattern. A pretest, mid-unit test, posttest, and retention test were administered. A pre-experiment and post-experiment student attitude inventory which measured attitude toward the course was administered, and a student attitude scale which measured the teacher’s instructional performance as perceived by the student was administered at the completion of the course. Results indicated that the pupil-centric pattern was superior to teacher-centric instruction in terms of student achievement.

Particle concentrations in patient rooms with various types of ventilation,"Particle concentration in patient rooms at various ventilation rates and with differing methods of air supply has been investigated experimentally in a specially built test room. The size of the test room corresponded to an ordinary bedroom for two patients. Air was supplied isothermally to this test room, either through induction units or through a perforated ceiling, and the number of air changes per hour varied from 1 to 16. When the air was supplied by means of induction units, tests with different airflow patterns in the room were also carried out. The principle of the measurements was to estimate the decrease in particle concentration at certain points when the initial concentration was uniform all over the room and no generation took place during the measuring period. Talc powder was used as test dust, and the particle concentration was measured at up to six points in the room with a particle counter. © 1973, Cambridge University Press.

A search for odour encoding in the olfactory lobe,"1. Studies were made of quality coding in the olfactory lobe of the insect by recording extracellular action potentials from single cells. 2. Listing cell spectra permits to distinguish two main groups of cells, namely, ‘odour specialist’ which respond very specifically to biologically important substances and ‘odour generalist’ which respond to a large variety of odorants (thirty‐two compounds) in an excitatory or inhibitory manner, or not responding at all. 3. Among more than fifty cells of the ‘odour generalists’, very few had similar, or identical, reaction spectra to an arbitrarily chosen set of thirty‐two odorants, while the ‘odour specialists’ are like each other in their response spectra. 4. There was an indication of a regional and layer differentiation of response in the lobe to the sex attractant. 5. ‘On’, ‘on—off’, and ‘off’ response types, as well as several variations on these response types, were found in single units during odour presentations. 6. Differences in patterning of excitation for each of the thirty‐two compounds can be readily detected by the comparison of the relative amounts of activity in each of the eighty‐one units tested. It is therefore concluded that the mechanism of odour encoding at the olfactory lobe may involve the linear combinations of every olfactory neurone's activity result ing in a unique across‐lobe pattern of discharges (‘odour code pattern’) for each particular odorant. 7. If it follows that odour discrimination by the lobe depends on such differences of ‘odour code patterns’, it would be possible then to distinguish very many odorants simply by having very many neurones possessing differential odour specificity. © 1971 The Physiological Society",Yamada M.,1971,Scopus,10.1113/jphysiol.1971.sp009423,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0015041277&doi=10.1113%2fjphysiol.1971.sp009423&partnerID=40&md5=0854ec0f0f522c7a5faa07547d38489e
Statistical Analysis of Motor Unit Firing Patterns in a Human Skeletal Muscle,"A statistical analysis of the firing pattern of single motor units in the human brachial biceps muscle is presented. Single motor unit spike trains are recorded and analyzed. The statistical treatment of these spike trains is as stochastic point processes, the theory of which is briefly discussed. Evidence is presented that motor unit spike trains may be modelled by a renewal process with an underlying gaussian probability density. Statistical independence of successive interspike intervals is shown using scatter diagrams; the hypothesis of a gaussian distribution is accepted at the 99th percentile confidence limit, chi-square test, in 90% of the units tested. A functional relationship between the mean and standard deviation is shown and discussed; its implications in obtaining sample size are presented in an appendix. The results of higher order analysis in the form of autocorrelograms and grouped interval histograms are presented. Grouped interval histograms are discussed in the context of motor unit data, and used to confirm the hypothesis that a stable probability density function does not represent a good model of the data at this level of analysis. © 1969, The Biophysical Society.

Amygdala unitary activity in the unrestrained cat,"In cats a micro-electroda base was stereotaxically implanted into the skull. After recovery from surgery, micro-electrodas were hydraulically driven through the base into the amygdala in unanesthetized, unrestrained animals. The effects of tape-recordad sounds (miaow, whistle, click, hiss), touch, light, smoke, reticular stimulation, and the presence of a white rat were tested on the unitary activity of the amygdala. Results were as follows: 1. 1. Most units of the amygdala showed spontaneous firing in the absence of experimental stimulation. 2. 2. In about half of the units tested the firing rate was modified undar the influence of sensory stimulation. 3. 3. Spontaneous sleep reduced the rate of spontaneous firing, dacreased the facilitatory and increased the inhibitory effects of sensory stimulation. 4. 4. Different sensory stimulations could show convergence of effects on the same unit. 5. 5. Each unit usually respondad with its own pattern (facilitation, inhibition, inhibition-facilitation) to different types of sensory stimulation. Reticular excitation would tend to enhance these responses. Also the attention of the animal seemed to play a role in unitary activity. 6. 6. Responses were more readily evoked by the ""miaow"" stimulus than by other types of sensory stimulation. 7. 7. The presence of a white rat in the cat's cage produced a rather prominent and lasting increase in the rate of unitary firing. 8. 8. Anatomically, the unitary responses were recordad from: (a) anterior, (b) lateral, and (c) medial part of the amygdaloid complex. The anterior area possessed fewer units responding to sensory stimulation than the other two. Facilitatory responses predominated in the lateral, and inhibitory responses in the medial area. Responses to visual stimulation were more numerous in the lateral group. Responses to touch and smoke did not show anatomical preference. © 1963.","Sawa M., dalgado JosM.R.",1963,Scopus,10.1016/0013-4694(63)90115-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0343897506&doi=10.1016%2f0013-4694%2863%2990115-9&partnerID=40&md5=a933d8ffeb086a8fc6511a4c59ff3e82

Are there any Unit Tests? An Empirical Study on Unit Testing in Open Source Python Projects,"Unit testing is an essential practice in Extreme Programming (XP) and Test-driven Development (TDD) and used in many software lifecycle models. Additionally, a lot of literature deals with this topic. Therefore, it can be expected that it is widely used among developers. Despite its importance, there is no empirical study which investigates, whether unit tests are used by developers in real life projects at all. This paper presents such a study, where we collected and analyzed data from over 70K revisions of 10 different Python projects. Based on two different definitions of unit testing, we calculated the actual number of unit tests and compared it with the expected number (as inferred from the intentions of the developers), had a look at the mocking behavior of developers, and at the evolution of the number of unit tests. Our main findings show, (i) that developers believe that they are developing more unit tests than they actually do, (ii) most projects have a very small amount of unit tests, (iii) developers make use of mocks, but these do not have a significant influence on the number of unit tests, (iv) four different patterns for the evolution of the number of unit tests could be detected, and (v) the used unit test definition has an influence on the results.","Trautsch, Fabian; Grabowski, Jens",2017.0,"2017 10TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE TESTING, VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION (ICST)",10.1109/ICST.2017.26,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICST.2017.26
Automatic Unit Test Generation for Machine Learning Libraries: How Far Are We?,"Automatic unit test generation that explores the input space and produces effective test cases for given programs have been studied for decades. Many unit test generation tools that can help generate unit test cases with high structural coverage over a program have limn examined. However, the fact that existing test generation tools are mainly evaluated on general software programs calls into question about its practical effectiveness and usefulness for machine learning libraries, which are statistically-orientated and have fundamentally different nature and construction from general software projects. In this paper, we set out to investigate the effectiveness of existing unit test generation techniques on machine learning libraries. To investigate this issue. we conducted an empirical study on five widely-used machine learning libraries with two popular unit test case generation tools. i.e.. EVOSUITE and Randoop. We find that (1) most of themachine learning libraries do not maintain a high-qualify unit test suite regarding commonly applied quality metrics such as code coverage (on average is 34.1%) and mutation score ton average is 21.3%), (2) unit test ease generation tools, i.e., EVOSUITE mid Randoop, lead to clear improvements in code coverage and mutation score. however, the improvement is limited, and (3) there exist common patterns in the uncovered code across the live machine learning libraries that can he used to improve unit test case generation tasks.","Wang, Song; Shrestha, Nishtha; Subburaman, Abarna Kucheri; Wang, Junjie; Wei, Moshi; Nagappan, Nachiappan",2021.0,2021 IEEE/ACM 43RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (ICSE 2021),10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00138,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00138

Differences between a static and a dynamic test-to-code traceability recovery method,"Recovering test-to-code traceability links may be required in virtually every phase of development. This task might seem simple for unit tests thanks to two fundamental unit testing guidelines: isolation (unit tests should exercise only a single unit) and separation (they should be placed next to this unit). However, practice shows that recovery may be challenging because the guidelines typically cannot be fully followed. Furthermore, previous works have already demonstrated that fully automatic test-to-code traceability recovery for unit tests is virtually impossible in a general case. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for this task, which is based on computing traceability links using static and dynamic approaches, comparing their results and presenting the discrepancies to the user, who will determine the final traceability links based on the differences and contextual information. We define a set of discrepancy patterns, which can help the user in this task. Additional outcomes of analyzing the discrepancies are structural unit testing issues and related refactoring suggestions. For the static test-to-code traceability, we rely on the physical code structure, while for the dynamic, we use code coverage information. In both cases, we compute combined test and code clusters which represent sets of mutually traceable elements. We also present an empirical study of the method involving 8 non-trivial open source Java systems.","Gergely, Tamas; Balogh, Gergo; Horvath, Ferenc; Vancsics, Bela; Beszedes, Arpad; Gyimothy, Tibor",2019.0,SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL,10.1007/s11219-018-9430-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11219-018-9430-x

JAOUT: Automated generation of aspect-oriented unit test,"Unit testing is a methodology for testing small parts of an application independently of whatever application uses them. It is time consuming and tedious to write unit tests, and it is especially difficult to write unit tests that model the pattern of usage of the application they will be used in. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) addresses the problem of separation of concerns in programs which is well suited to unit test problems. What's more, unit tests should be made from different concerns in the application instead of just from functional assertions of correctness or error. In this paper, we firstly present a new concept, application-specific Aspects, which mean top-level aspects picked up from generic low-level aspects in AOP for specific use. It can be viewed as the separation of concerns on applications of generic low-level aspects. Second, this paper describes an Aspect-Oriented Test Description Language (AOTDL) and techniques to build top-level aspects for testing on generic aspects. Third, we generate JUnit unit testing framework and test oracles from AspectJ programs by integrating our tool with AspectJ and JUnit. We use runtime exceptions thrown by testing aspects to decide whether methods work well. Finally, we present a double-phase testing way to filter out meaningless test cases in our framework.","Xu, GQ; Yang, ZY; Huang, HT; Chen, Q; Chen, L; Xu, FB",2004.0,"11TH ASIA-PACIFIC SOFTWARE ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/

Carving and Replaying Differential Unit Test Cases from System Test Cases,"Unit test cases are focused and efficient. System tests are effective at exercising complex usage patterns. Differential unit tests (DUTs) are a hybrid of unit and system tests that exploits their strengths. They are generated by carving the system components, while executing a system test case, that influence the behavior of the target unit and then reassembling those components so that the unit can be exercised as it was by the system test. In this paper, we show that DUTs retain some of the advantages of unit tests, can be automatically generated, and have the potential for revealing faults related to intricate system executions. We present a framework for carving and replaying DUTs that accounts for a wide variety of strategies and trade-offs, we implement an automated instance of the framework with several techniques to mitigate test cost and enhance flexibility and robustness, and we empirically assess the efficacy of carving and replaying DUTs on three software artifacts.","Elbaum, Sebastian; Chin, Hui Nee; Dwyer, Matthew B.; Jorde, Matthew",2009.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1109/TSE.2008.103,https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2008.103
"A Large-Scale Study on the Usage of Testing Patterns that Address Maintainability Attributes Patterns for Ease of Modification, Diagnoses, and Comprehension","Test case maintainability is an important concern, especially in open source and distributed development environments where projects typically have high contributor turnover with varying backgrounds and experience, and where code ownership changes often. Similar to design patterns, patterns for unit testing promote maintainability quality attributes such as ease of diagnoses, modifiability, and comprehension. In this paper, we report the results of a large-scale study on the usage of four xUnit testing patterns which can be used to satisfy these maintainability attributes. This is a first-of-its-kind study which developed automated techniques to investigate these issues across 82,447 open source projects, and the findings provide more insight into testing practices in open source projects. Our results indicate that only 17% of projects had test cases, and from the 251 testing frameworks we studied, 93 of them were being used. We found 24% of projects with test files implemented patterns that could help with maintainability, while the remaining did not use these patterns. Multiple qualitative analyses indicate that usage of patterns was an ad-hoc decision by individual developers, rather than motivated by the characteristics of the project, and that developers sometimes used alternative techniques to address maintainability concerns.","Gonzalez, Danielle; Santos, Joanna C.

We also observe a getter-setter-getter testing pattern from the SWMM unit tests, and suggest a diversified way of executing regression tests.","Peng, Zedong; Lin, Xuanyi; Simon, Michelle; Niu, Nan",2021.0,JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE,10.1016/j.jocs.2021.101347,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2021.101347
A Study on the Relation Between Antipatterns and the Cost of Class Unit Testing,"Antipatterns are known as recurring, poor design choices; recent and past studies indicated that they negatively affect software systems in terms of understandability and maintainability, also increasing change-and defect-proneness. For this reason, refactoring actions are often suggested. In this paper, we investigate a different side-effect of antipatterns, which is their effect on testability and on testing cost in particular. We consider as (upper bound) indicator of testing cost the number of test cases that satisfy the minimal data member usage matrix (MaDUM) criterion proposed by Bashir and Goel. A study-carried out on four Java programs, Ant 1.8.3, ArgoUML 0.20, CheckStyle 4.0, and JFreeChart 1.0.13-supports the evidence that, on the one hand, antipatterns unit testing requires, on average, a number of test cases substantially higher than unit testing for non-antipattern classes. On the other hand, antipattern classes must be carefully tested because they are more defect-prone than other classes. Finally, we illustrate how specific refactoring actions-applied to classes participating in antipatterns-could reduce testing cost.","Sabane, Aminata; Di Penta, Massimiliano; Antoniol, Giuliano; Gueheneuc, Yann-Gael",2013.0,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND REENGINEERING (CSMR 2013),10.1109/CSMR.2013.26,https://doi.org/10.1109/CSMR.2013.26
Test Logic Reuse Through Unit Test Patterns A Test Automation Framework for Software Product Lines,"Software product line (SPL) brings benefits such as lower time-to-market, less development costs, increased productivity and improved quality. The quality assurance can be reached through the testing area, however this area still has challenges and gaps in the SPL development. Since not all testing techniques used in a single product development can be applied to SPL, because of artifacts variabilities, further adaptations and new proposals are required. Our proposal thus is to adapt some unit tests patterns to SPL needs. The Test Automation Framework and Data-Driven Test patterns can provide the reuse of test logic and the automation of implementation mechanisms, reducing the effort required to test the variations of each application. Thus, we propose the Data-Driven Test Automation Framework to be used during the application engineering to configure the tests through Parameterized Tests and verify the correctness of the generated applications. An example of a SPL is also presented.","Neves, Glauco Silva; Vilain, Patricia",2014.0,2014 IEEE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION REUSE AND INTEGRATION (IRI),,https://doi.org/
A pattern-based approach to detect and improve non-descriptive test names,"Unit tests are an important artifact that supports the software development process in several ways. For example, when a test fails, its name can provide the first step towards understanding the purpose of the test. Unfortunately, unit tests often lack descriptive names. In this paper, we propose a new, pattern-based approach that can help developers improve the quality of test names of JUnit tests by making them more descriptive. It does this by detecting non-descriptive test names and in some cases, providing additional information about how the name can be improved. Our approach was assessed using an empirical evaluation on 34352 JUnit tests. The results of the evaluation show that the approach is feasible, accurate, and useful at discriminating descriptive and non-descriptive names with a 95% true-positive rate. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A GUI based Unit Testing Technique for Anti-pattern Identification,"Anti-patterns are considered as deficient programming practices that are unacceptable as a solution. They can be thought of as certain patterns in software development that are undesirable in comparison to design patterns which are acceptable solutions formalized for a common problem. From the study on anti-pattern classes involved in object-oriented systems, we examined the impact of presence of anti-patterns on the system. There are certain issues with the testing strategies used for finding bugs in the software systems such as objectives of testing, procedure used to test new functions, maximum resources and time needed to execute the project and the environment in which testing needs to be carried out. There is an enormous requirement to carry out testing process in a more suitable way due to the enlarged complications in the development of software systems. Anti-pattern testing is concerned with the reduction of testing cost for different modules. In this paper, we propose a new GUI based testing technique for the identification of anti patterns in object-oriented systems through automation testing.","Kaur, Harvinder; Kaur, Puneet Jai",2014.0,2014 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CONFLUENCE THE NEXT GENERATION INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUMMIT (CONFLUENCE),,https://doi.org/
A Scalable Infrastructure for Teaching Concepts of Programming Languages in Scala with WebLab,"In this paper, we report on our experience in teaching a course on concepts of programming languages at TU Delft based on Krishnamurthi's PAPL book with the definitional interpreter approach using Scala as meta-language and using the WebLab learning management system. In particular, we discuss our experience with encoding of definitional interpreters in Scala using case classes, pattern matching, and recursive functions; offering this material in the web-based learning management system WebLab; automated grading and feedback of interpreter submissions using unit tests; testing tests to force students to formulate tests, instead of just implementing interpreters; generation of tests based on a reference implementation to reduce the effort of producing unit tests; and the construction of a product line of interpreters in order to maximize reuse and consistency between reference implementations.","van der Lippe, Tim; Smith, Thomas; Pelsmaeker, Daniel; Visser, Eelco",2016.0,SCALA'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 7TH ACM SIGPLAN SYMPOSIUM ON SCALA,10.1145/2998392.2998402,https://doi.org/10.1145/2998392.2998402
Production Monitoring to Improve Test Suites,"In this article, we propose to use production executions to improve the quality of testing for certain methods of interest for developers. These methods can be methods that are not covered by the existing test suite or methods that are poorly tested. We devise an approach called pankti which monitors applications as they execute in production and then automatically generates differential unit tests, as well as derived oracles, from the collected data. pankti's monitoring and generation focuses on one single programming language, Java. We evaluate it on three real-world, open-source projects: a videoconferencing system, a PDF manipulation library, and an e-commerce application. We show that pankti is able to generate differential unit tests by monitoring target methods in production and that the generated tests improve the quality of the test suite of the application under consideration.","Tiwari, Deepika; Zhang, Long; Monperrus, Martin; Baudry, Benoit",2022.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY,10.1109/TR.2021.3101318,https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2021.3101318
Unit Testing Web Services,"Web services (WS) are becoming a key architectural aspect of large-scale distributed applications. Technology leaders are both launching service-centric applications, such as Google Earth, eBay Web Services, and Amazon's E-Commerce Service, and creating tools that enable other organizations to publish web services. The standards-based, fault-tolerant, self-describing nature of web services enable the creation of loosely coupled applications that run on heterogeneous systems. Web services also enable interoperability between different online applications and enable innovative, synergistic combinations: mashups. While the prime directive for developers once was put it on the Internet, the main goal now is often to make it a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). For Agile developers, following best practices by doing Test-Driven Development (TDD) of WS code can require extra effort, but is definitely feasible. In this article, I present techniques and patterns for unit testing WS applications to enable TDD as well as general-purpose testing.","Hamill, Paul",2008.0,DR DOBBS JOURNAL,,https://doi.org/
Evidence for Programming Strategies in University Coding Exercises,"Success in coding exercises is deeply related to the strategy employed by the students to solve coding tasks. In this contribution, we analyze the programming assignments of 600 students from an introductory university course in object-oriented programming The students were provided unit tests for the assessment of their code, and their editing and testing actions were recorded using an Eclipse plug-in. The primary motivation for this study is to discover the programming strategies used by students for coding exercises with different difficulty levels, and find out if any relation exists between these strategies and the success in solving the coding tasks. More insights into this process will enable educators to provide future students timely, appropriate and constructive feedback on their coding process. Thus, to predict success in the coding exercises, we used indicators from students' testing behaviour reflecting the time and effort differences between two successive unit test runs. The results show a clear difference in the strategies employed by students within different success levels. The results also highlight ways of providing actionable feedback to the students in a timely and appropriate manner.","Sharma, Kshitij; Mangaroska, Katerina; Traetteberg, Halvard; Lee-Cultura, Serena; Giannakos, Michail",2018.0,"LIFELONG TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED LEARNING, EC-TEL 2018",10.1007/978-3-319-98572-5_25,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98572-5_25
Seuss: Decoupling responsibilities from static methods for fine-grained configurability,"Unit testing is often made more difficult by the heavy use of classes as namespaces and the proliferation of static methods to encapsulate configuration code. We have analyzed the use of 120 static methods from 96 projects by categorizing them according to their responsibilities. We find that most static methods support a hodgepodge of mixed responsibilities, held together only by their common need to be globally visible. Tight coupling between instances and their classes breaks encapsulation, and, together with the global visibility of static methods, complicates testing. By making dependency injection a feature of the programming language, we can get rid of static methods altogether. We employ the following semantic changes: (1) Replace every occurrence of a global with an access to an instance variable; (2) Let that instance variable be automatically injected into the object when it is instantiated. We present Seuss, a prototype that implements this change of semantics in Smalltalk. We show how Seuss eliminates the need to use class methods for non-reflective purposes, reduces the need for creational design patterns such as Abstract Factory and simplifies configuration code, particularly for unit tests. We present benchmarks showing that Seuss introduces a 34 % additional memory cost, and runs at 53 % speed, without any optimizations.","Schwarz, Niko; Lungu, Mircea; Nierstrasz, Oscar",2012.0,JOURNAL OF OBJECT TECHNOLOGY,10.5381/jot.2012.11.1.a3,https://doi.org/10.5381/jot.2012.11.1.a3

We present a process measurement approach for TDD that relies on the analysis of fine-grained data collected during coding activities. This data is mined to produce abstractions regarding programmers' work patterns. Programmers, instructors, and coaches receive concrete feedback by visualizing these abstractions. Process measurement has the potential to accelerate the learning of TDD, enhance its effectiveness, aid in its empirical evaluation, and support project tracking.","Wang, YH; Erdogmus, H",2004.0,"EXTREME PROGRAMMING AND AGILE METHODS - XP/ AGILE UNIVERSE 2004, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
Multiple Testing for No Cointegration under Nonstationary Volatility,"With cointegration tests often being oversized under time-varying error variance, it is possible, if not likely, to confuse error variance non-stationarity with cointegration. This paper takes an instrumental variable (IV) approach to establish individual-unit test statistics for no cointegration that are robust to variance non-stationarity. The sign of a fitted departure from long-run equilibrium is used as an instrument when estimating an error-correction model. The resulting IV-based test is shown to follow a chi-square limiting null distribution irrespective of the variance pattern of the data-generating process. In spite of this, the test proposed here has, unlike previous work relying on instrumental variables, competitive local power against sequences of local alternatives in 1/T-neighbourhoods of the null. The standard limiting null distribution motivates, using the single-unit tests in a multiple testing approach for cointegration in multi-country data sets by combining P-values from individual units. Simulations suggest good performance of the single-unit and multiple testing procedures under various plausible designs of cross-sectional correlation and cross-unit cointegration in the data. An application to the equilibrium relationship between short- and long-term interest rates illustrates the dramatic differences between results of robust and non-robust tests.","Demetrescu, Matei; Hanck, Christoph",2018.0,OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS,10.1111/obes.12214,https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.12214
Automated Critique of Early Programming Antipatterns,"The introductory programming lab, with small cycles of teaching, coding, testing, and critique from instructors, is an extraordinarily productive learning experience for novice programmers. We wish to extend the availability of such critique through automation, capturing the essence of interaction between student and instructor as closely as possible. Integrated Development Environments and Automated Grading Systems provide constant feedback through static analysis and unit testing. But we also wish to tailor automated feedback to acknowledge commonly recurring issues with novice programmers, in keeping with the practice of a human instructor. We argue that the kinds of mistakes that novice programmers make, and the way they are reported to the novices, deserve special care. In this paper we provide examples of early programming antipatterns that have arisen from our teaching experience, and describe different ways of identifying and dealing with them automatically through our tool WebTA. Novice students may produce code that is close to a correct solution but contains syntactic errors; WebTA attempts to salvage the promising portions of the student's submission and suggest repairs that are more meaningful than typical compiler error messages. Alternatively, a student misunderstanding may result in well-formed code that passes unit tests yet contains clear design flaws; through additional analysis, WebTA can identify and flag them. Finally, certain types of antipattern can be anticipated and flagged by the instructor, based on the context of the course and the programming exercise; WebTA allows for customizable critique triggers and messages.","Ureel, Leo C., II; Wallace, Charles",2019.0,SIGCSE '19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 50TH ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION,10.1145/3287324.3287463,https://doi.org/10.1145/3287324.3287463

"Software Quality Assurance During Implementation: Results of a Survey in Software Houses from Germany, Austria and Switzerland","Context: Quality assurance performed during the implementation phase, e.g., by coding guidelines, static analysis or unit testing, is of high importance to ensure quality of software, but there is a lack of common knowledge and best practices on it. Objective: The goal of this paper is to investigate the state-of-practice of quality assurance during the implementation phase in software houses. Method: For this purpose, we conducted a survey in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where 57 software houses participated. The questionnaire comprised questions regarding techniques, tools, and effort for software quality assurance during implementation as well as the perceived quality after implementation. The results were complemented by interviews and results from other surveys on software quality in general. Results: Results from the survey show that the most common software quality assurance techniques used during implementation are unit testing, code reviews and coding guidelines. Most tool support is used in the areas of bug tracking, version control and project management. Due to relationships between the used tool types, it seems that the introduction of one tool leads to the adoption of several others. Also quality assurance techniques and tools are correlated. Bug fixing takes a significant ratio of the overall project effort assigned to implementation. Furthermore, we found that the more developers a software company has, the more effort is spent on bug fixing. Finally, more than half of all companies rated the quality after implementation as rather good to good. Conclusion: For the most important quality assurance techniques and supporting tool types clear usage patterns can be seen and serve as a basis to provide guidelines on their application in practice.","Felderer, Michael; Auer, Florian",2017.0,SOFTWARE QUALITY: COMPLEXITY AND CHALLENGES OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES,10.1007/978-3-319-49421-0_7,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49421-0_7

They are a part of a larger refactoring patterns pattern collection. We introduce the pattern collection and the background and describe three patterns in detail. Revision control logging pattern helps to maintain the rationale of the refactoring operations and separates refactoring from, for instance, feature development and bug fixes. Embed small refactorings encourages you to do the minor tweaks, fixes, and changes during your daily routines.

C++11/14 Mutation Operators Based on Common Fault Patterns,"The C++11/14 standard offers a wealth of features aimed at helping programmers write better code. Unfortunately, some of these features may cause subtle programming faults, likely to go unnoticed during code reviews. In this paper we propose four new mutation operators for C++11/14 based on common fault patterns, which allow to verify whether a unit test suite is capable of testing against such faults. We validate the relevance of the proposed mutation operators by performing a case study on seven real-life software systems.","Parsai, Ali; Demeyer, Serge; De Busser, Seph",2018.0,TESTING SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS (ICTSS 2018),10.1007/978-3-319-99927-2_9,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-99927-2_9
Designing multi-agent unit tests using systematic test design patterns-(extended version),"Software agents are the basic building blocks in many software systems especially those based on artificial intelligence methods, e.g., reinforcement learning based multi-agent systems (MASs). However, testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy, distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows MAS developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the JADE agent platform, the JUnit framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations.

A platform-based software design methodology for embedded control systems: An agile toolkit,"A discrete control system, with stringent hardware constraints, is effectively an embedded real-time system and hence requires a rigorous methodology to develop the software involved. The development methodology proposed in this paper adapts agile principles and patterns to support the building of embedded control systems, focusing on the issues relating to a system's constraints and safety. Strong unit testing, to ensure correctness, including the satisfaction of timing constraints, is the foundation of the proposed methodology. A platform-based design approach is used to balance costs and time-to-market in relation to performance and functionality constraints. It is concluded that the proposed methodology significantly reduces design time and costs, as well as leading to better software modularity and reliability.","Cordeiro, Lucas; Mar, Carlos; Valentin, Eduardo; Cruz, Fabiano; Patrick, Daniel; Barreto, Raimundo; Lucena, Vicente",2008.0,"FIFTEENTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOPS ON THE ENGINEERING OF COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS",10.1109/ECBS.2008.19,https://doi.org/10.1109/ECBS.2008.19

Students vs. Professionals: Improving the Learning of Software Testing,"Software testing is a crucial phase of software development. Educators now are assessing tests written by students. Methods have been proposed to assess the completeness of student-written tests. However, there is more to good test quality than completeness, and these additional quality are not assessed by the previous work. Test smells are patterns of poorly designed tests that may negatively affect the quality of test and production code. We propose to assess test smells in students' code to improve the quality of software tests they write. In the early stages of this research, we will examine whether practitioners actually spend time and energy to remove those test smells summarized by researchers backed by real-world software projects. Then, we will develop and evaluate our new assessment method.","Chen, Zhongyan",2022.0,2022 ACM/IEEE 44TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING: COMPANION PROCEEDINGS (ICSE-COMPANION 2022),10.1145/3510454.3517058,https://doi.org/10.1145/3510454.3517058

Applying a pairwise coverage criterion to scenario-based testing,"Some scenario-based testing approaches propose to express a test suite as a regular expression (called scenario or pattern). It specifies a set of valid sequences of operations in a abstract way. When the regular expression is unfold, test sequences are obtained. Usually, the unfolding is done in an exhaustive way, which can result in a combinatorial explosion. In this article, we explore a pairwise coverage criterion to select a subset of test sequences satisfying the pattern, in order to decrease the number of test sequences. The originality of the approach lies in the fact that the pairwise criterion is applied to the instantiated method calls (and not on the parameters). We applied this strategy to generate unit tests for Java classes. The quality of the test suites is evaluated with a mutation analysis and compared to test suites randomly generated.","du Bousquet, L.; Delahaye, M.; Oriat, C.",2016.0,"2016 IEEE NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE TESTING, VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION WORKSHOPS (ICSTW)",10.1109/ICSTW.2016.23,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTW.2016.23
Exploring the Composition of Unit Test Suites,"In agile software development, test code can considerably contribute to the overall source code size. Being a valuable asset both in terms of verification and documentation, the composition of a test suite needs to be well understood in order to identify opportunities as well as weaknesses for further evolution. In this paper we argue that the visualization of structural characteristics is a viable means to support the exploration of test suites. Thanks to general agreement on a limited set of key test design principles, such visualizations are relatively easy to interpret. In particular we present visualizations that support testers in (i) locating test cases; (ii) examining the relation between test code and production code; and (iii) studying the composition of and dependencies within test cases. By means of two case studies, we demonstrate how visual patterns help to identify key test suite characteristics.","Van Rompaey, Bart; Demeyer, Serge",2008.0,"2008 23RD IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING WORKSHOPS, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/

A framework for porting the NeuroBayes machine learning algorithm to FPGAs,"The NeuroBayes machine learning algorithm is deployed for online data reduction at the pixel detector of Belle II. In order to test, characterize and easily adapt its implementation on FPGAs, a framework was developed.

Under usage of input data from physics simulations figures of merit like throughput, accuracy and resource demand of the implementation are evaluated in a fast and flexible way.

Putting a motor on the canoo WebTest acceptance testing framework,"User acceptance testing is finally getting the attention and tool support it deserves. It is imperative that acceptance tests follow the best practices and embody the critical success factors that have been established over the years for automated unit testing. However, it is often challenging for acceptance tests to be repeatable, readable, and maintainable due to the nature of the tests and the tools currently available for automation. The key contributions this paper makes to the agile community are: first, it provides concrete examples of applying test automation patterns to user acceptance testing, and secondly it provides a description of various extensions to the WebTest acceptance testing framework that facilitate developing automated acceptance tests according to these established best practices.","Andrea, J",2004.0,"EXTREME PROGRAMMING AND AGILE PROCESSES IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
A software component verification tool,"Component-Based Software Engineering depends on reliable, robust components, since it may omit a unit test phase wholly or partially from the development cycle. This paper escribes a tool that allows a component developed to design and nln verification tests. In developing components for our library, we found it necessary to provide,ide multiple mechanisms for identifying and capturing tests to overcome the limitations of any single mechanism. Once specified, test specifications and test results al-e stored in XML documents, providing a standard, pot-table form of storing, retrieving and updating test histories. One module of our component test bench, the test pattern verifier; has been designed to be general, lightweight and portable, so that it carl be packaged with a component and its test specifications. This allows a component user to verify a component's compliance with specifications in a target environment.","Bundell, GA; Lee, G; Morris, J; Parker, K; Lam, P",2000.0,"INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE METHODS AND TOOLS, PROCEEDING",10.1109/SWMT.2000.890429,https://doi.org/10.1109/SWMT.2000.890429
A framework for streamlining research workflow in neuroscience and psychology,"Successful accumulation of knowledge is critically dependent on the ability to verify and replicate every part of scientific conduct. However, such principles are difficult to enact when researchers continue to resort on ad-hoc workflows and with poorly maintained code base. In this paper I examine the needs of neuroscience and psychology community, and introduce psychopy_ext, a unifying framework that seamlessly integrates popular experiment building, analysis and manuscript preparation tools by choosing reasonable defaults and implementing relatively rigid patterns of workflow. This structure allows for automation of multiple tasks, such as generated user interfaces, unit testing, control analyses of stimuli, single-command access to descriptive statistics, and publication quality plotting. Taken together, psychopy_ext opens an exciting possibility for a faster, more robust code development and collaboration for researchers.","Kubilius, Jonas",2014.0,FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS,10.3389/fninf.2013.00052,https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2013.00052
Testing the testing effect in the classroom,"Laboratory studies show that taking a test on studied material promotes subsequent learning and retention of that material on a final test ( termed the testing effect). Educational research has virtually ignored testing as a technique to improve classroom learning. We investigated the testing effect in a college course. Students took weekly quizzes followed by multiple choice criterial tests ( unit tests and a cumulative final). Weekly quizzes included multiple choice or short answer questions, after which feedback was provided. As an exposure control, in some weeks students were presented target material for additional reading. Quizzing, but not additional reading, improved performance on the criterial tests relative to material not targeted by quizzes. Further, short answer quizzes produced more robust benefits than multiple choice quizzes. This pattern converges with laboratory findings showing that recall tests are more beneficial than recognition tests for subsequent memory performance. We conclude that in the classroom testing can be used to promote learning, not just to evaluate learning.","McDaniel, Mark A.; Anderson, Janis L.; Derbish, Mary H.; Morrisette, Nova",2007.0,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY,10.1080/09541440701326154,https://doi.org/10.1080/09541440701326154
Detecting Bugs of Concurrent Programs With Program Invariants,"Concurrency bug detection is a time-consuming activity in the debugging process for concurrent programs. Existing techniques mainly focus on detecting data race bugs with pattern analysis; however, the number of interleaving patterns could be huge, only the most suspicious write-read pattern is given, and an oracle is needed, which is not available in the operational phase. This paper proposes a program-invariant-based technique to detect a class of concurrent program bugs. By unit testing of the components of a concurrent program, we obtain a set of program invariants, which can be used as an oracle to obtain bad invariants when the program is online. By using the function call graph of the components and applying a reduction technique to the invariants, we find the candidates of suspicious functions and rank them. From the interactions among components, we analyze the causes to the concurrency bugs. Experimental results show that our proposed technique is effective in concurrency bug detection.","Wang, Rong; Ding, Zuohua; Gui, Ning; Liu, Yang",2017.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY,10.1109/TR.2017.2681107,https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2017.2681107

A model-based statistical usage testing of communication protocols,"In this paper we present our original approach to the model-based statistical usage testing of a class of communication protocol implementations that are based on the State design pattern and Java programming environment augmented with the class FSMSystem. The approach is based on the working environment that has been proven on a number of real-world projects. The working environment is created with the following set of tools: generic modeling environment with the operational profile model paradigm registered to it, operational profile model interpreter, generic test case generator, test case compiler, and the unit testing framework JUnit extended with the class TestBed that acts as both test driver and stub thus providing the complete test harness. In the paper we present the methodology of the model-based statistical usage testing of a class of communication protocol implementations, the tools that support this methodology, and the case study - the model based statistical usage testing of SIP INVITE client transaction, a part of the SIP protocol stack.","Popovic, Miroslav; Basicevic, Ilija; Velikic, Ivan; Tatic, Jelena",2006.0,"13TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM AND WORKSHOP ON ENGINEERING OF COMPUTER BASED SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS: MASTERING THE COMPLEXITY OF COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS",10.1109/ECBS.2006.11,https://doi.org/10.1109/ECBS.2006.11
Multi-Threaded Message Dispatcher - a Design Pattern with Innate Support for Mission Critical Applications,"The usage of well-tried software design patterns and application frameworks is often encountered in Mission and Safety Critical Applications development due to the high stakes involved in the case of failures. To increase reliability, some frameworks attempt to separate the implementation of business logic and low level implementation details and move the latter inside of framework-implementation in order to allow the developers to focus on the problem as much as possible, while still providing the necessary infrastructure in easy to use API's. In this paper we present a framework for message processing which takes advantage of the newer C++11 features to enforce separation of concerns, perform dead-lock avoidance, and encourage unit testing.

Controller Augmentation and Test Point Insertion at RTL for Concurrent Operational Unit Testing,"Testpoint insertion methods to reduce the number of test patterns at register transfer level are required for the adaptability of traditional VLSI design flows and the reduction of time to search test point locations. In this paper, we propose a design-for-testability method at register transfer level to enable operational units as many as possible to be concurrently tested in scan testing. Using test point insertion and controller augmentation, the proposed design-for-testability method allocates input test registers and an output test register to inputs and an output of each operational unit in a data-path, respectively. Test compaction efficiency becomes high by enabling effective concurrent testing for operational units. Experimental results on high-level benchmark circuits show that our proposed method reduced the number of test patterns by 20% with 63 % area overhead on average.","Hosokawa, Toshinori; Takeda, Shun; Yamazaki, Hiroshi; Yoshimura, Masayoshi",2017.0,2017 IEEE 23RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ON-LINE TESTING AND ROBUST SYSTEM DESIGN (IOLTS),,https://doi.org/
Corral framework: Trustworthy and fully functional data intensive parallel astronomical pipelines,"Data processing pipelines represent an important slice of the astronomical software library that include chains of processes that transform raw data into valuable information via data reduction and analysis. In this work we present Corral, a Python framework for astronomical pipeline generation. Corral features a Model-View-Controller design pattern on top of an SQL Relational Database capable of handling: custom data models; processing stages; and communication alerts, and also provides automatic quality and structural metrics based on unit testing. The Model-View-Controller provides concept separation between the user logic and the data models, delivering at the same time multi-processing and distributed computing capabilities. Corral represents an improvement over commonly found data processing pipelines in astronomy since the design pattern eases the programmer from dealing with processing flow and parallelization issues, allowing them to focus on the specific algorithms needed for the successive data transformations and at the same time provides a broad measure of quality over the created pipeline.

Automatic Firmware Emulation through Invalidity-guided Knowledge Inference,"Emulating firmware for microcontrollers is challenging due to the tight coupling between the hardware and firmware. This has greatly impeded the application of dynamic analysis tools to firmware analysis. The state-of-the-art work automatically models unknown peripherals by observing their access patterns, and then leverages heuristics to calculate the appropriate responses when unknown peripheral registers are accessed. However, we empirically found that this approach and the corresponding heuristics are frequently insufficient to emulate firmware. In this work, we propose a new approach called mu Emu to emulate firmware with unknown peripherals. Unlike existing work that attempts to build a general model for each peripheral, our approach learns how to correctly emulate firmware execution at individual peripheral access points. It takes the image as input and symbolically executes it by representing unknown peripheral registers as symbols. During symbolic execution, it infers the rules to respond to unknown peripheral accesses. These rules are stored in a knowledge base, which is referred to during the dynamic firmware analysis. mu Emu achieved a passing rate of 95% in a set of unit tests for peripheral drivers without any manual assistance. We also evaluated mu Emu with real-world firmware samples and new bugs were discovered.","Zhou, Wei; Guan, Le; Liu, Peng; Zhang, Yuqing",2021.0,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 30TH USENIX SECURITY SYMPOSIUM,,https://doi.org/
Enhanced cross-entropy method for dynamic economic dispatch with valve-point effects,"This paper proposes an enhanced cross-entropy (ECE) method to solve dynamic economic dispatch (DED) problem with valve-point effects. The cross-entropy (CE) method, originated from an adaptive variance minimization algorithm for estimating probabilities of rare events, is a generic approach to combinatorial and multi-extremal optimization. Exploration capability of CE algorithm is enhanced in this paper by using chaotic sequence and the resultant ECE is applied to DED with valve-point effects. The performance of the proposed ECE method is rigorously tested for optimality, convergence, robustness and computational efficiency on a 10-unit test system. Additional test cases with different load patterns and increased number of generators are also solved by ECE. Numerical results show that the proposed ECE approach finds high-quality solutions reliably with faster convergence. It outperforms CE and all the previous approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Magni - A Framework for Developing Context-Aware Mobile Applications,"The advent of Internet and ubiquitous technologies has been fostering the appearance of intelligent mobile applications aware of their environment and the objects nearby. Despite its popularity, mobile developers are often required to write large and disorganized amounts of code, mixing UI with business logic and interact, in a ad-hoc fashion, with sensor devices and services. These habits hinder the code maintenance, refactoring and testing, while negatively influencing the consistency and performance of mobile applications. In this paper we present Magni as an abstract framework for the design and implementation of personalized and context-aware mobile applications. The corner stone of the framework is its architectural pattern based on the Model-View-Presenter pattern in the UI layer relying in REST services the majority of the app features. This paradigm fosters the modular design, implementing the separation of concerns concept and allowing an easier implementation of unit tests. In order to validate the framework, we present a prototype for an healthcare automotive app. The main goal of the app is to facilitate the access to health related points of interest such as hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.","Queiros, Ricardo; Portela, Filipe; Machado, Jose",2017.0,"RECENT ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES, VOL 3",10.1007/978-3-319-56541-5_43,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56541-5_43
A Design Pattern Approach for RESTful tests: a case study,"The REST architectural style was introduced as an alternative to the design of web services. It is much simpler than SOAP and WSDL-based services, so many companies have started to use it. This makes the tests carried out on this architecture become more important. Even though there are many tools available, only a few of them can be incorporated to a process of continuous software development, where time is a key factor. In this paper, we present a design pattern for RESTful tests, based on the principles of this architecture and on the unit test basics. The approach has been implemented in three companies of software development as a framework. It has been proved that there has been a 90 % decrease in the time spent during automated regressions and refactoring in a continuous integration environment. Finally, the use of tools to execute automated tests has given rise to other kinds of improvements, such as the automatic generation of reports.","Agustin Mascheroni, Maximiliano; Irrazabal, Emanuel",2018.0,OBRAS COLECTIVAS EN CIENCIAS DE LA COMPUTACION,,https://doi.org/
Solving Economic Load Dispatch Problem Using Vortex Search Algorithm,"The Vortex Search (VS) algorithmis a recently developed metaheuristic algorithm inspired by a vortex pattern which can be modeled as a number of the nested circles. This algorithm basically adjusts step sizes automatically according to changed values of the radius of circles to improve solutions. In this work, the VS algorithm is applied to solve the economic load dispatch (ELD) problem in the 20-unit test system by considering the system constraints and also the performance of this algorithm has been analyzed in terms of total generation costs and power losses. Simulation results have been compared to the different algorithms used before in the literature. The obtained results demonstrate that VS algorithm is capable of solving the ELD minimization problem efficiently and finding the output power of all the generation units properly.","Kuyu, Yigit Cagatay; Erdem, Nergis",2017.0,2017 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING (ELECO),,https://doi.org/
The same analysis approach: Practical protection against the pitfalls of novel neuroimaging analysis methods,"Standard neuroimaging data analysis based on traditional principles of experimental design, modelling, and statistical inference is increasingly complemented by novel analysis methods, driven e.g. by machine learning methods. While these novel approaches provide new insights into neuroimaging data, they often have unexpected properties, generating a growing literature on possible pitfalls. We propose to meet this challenge by adopting a habit of systematic testing of experimental design, analysis procedures, and statistical inference. Specifically, we suggest to apply the analysis method used for experimental data also to aspects of the experimental design, simulated confounds, simulated null data, and control data. We stress the importance of keeping the analysis method the same in main and test analyses, because only this way possible confounds and unexpected properties can be reliably detected and avoided. We describe and discuss this Same Analysis Approach in detail, and demonstrate it in two worked examples using multivariate decoding. With these examples, we reveal two sources of error: A mismatch between counterbalancing (crossover designs) and cross-validation which leads to systematic below-chance accuracies, and linear decoding of a nonlinear effect, a difference in variance.","Goergen, Kai; Hebart, Martin N.; Allefeld, Carsten; Haynes, John-Dylan",2018.0,NEUROIMAGE,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.083,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.12.083
Reducing no fault found using statistical processing and an expert system,"This paper describes a method for capturing avionics test failure results from Automated Test Equipment (ATE) and statistically processing this data to provide decision support for software engineers in reducing No Fault Found (NFF) cases at various testing levels. NFFs have plagued the avionics test and repair environment for years at enormous cost to readiness and logistics support. The costs in terms of depot repair and user exchange dollars that are wasted annually for unresolved cases are graphically illustrated. A diagnostic data model is presented, which automatically captures, archives and statistically processes test parameters and failure results which are then used to determine if an NFF at the next testing level resulted from a test anomaly. The model includes statistical process methods, which produce historical trend patterns for each part and serial numbered unit tested. An Expert System is used to detect statistical pattern changes and stores that information in a knowledge base. A Decision Support System (DSS) provides advisories for engineers and technicians by combining the statistical test pattern with unit performance changes in the knowledge base. Examples of specific F-16 NFF reduction results are provided.","Steadman, B; Pombo, T; Madison, I; Shively, J; Kirkland, L",2002.0,"2002 IEEE AUTOTESTCON PROCEEEDINGS, SYSTEMS READINESS TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE",,https://doi.org/
A new approach for GenCos profit based unit commitment in day-ahead competitive electricity markets considering reserve uncertainty,"This paper presents a new approach for GenCos Profit Based Unit Commitment (GPBUC) in day-ahead competitive electricity markets. Generation, spinning and non-spinning reserves are considered in the proposed formulation. The estimated probability that spinning and non-spinning reserves are called and generated is also considered in the formulation to simulate the reserve uncertainty. The artificial neural network (ANN) is applied for forecasting the reserve probability considering line limits, line and generator outages, market prices, bidding strategy, load and reserves patterns. Fuel and emission constraints are included in the model. A hybrid method between Lagrangian relaxation (LR) and evolutionary programming (EP) is applied to solve the proposed GPBUC problem. The proposed approach is applied to a 36 unit test system and the results are compared with those obtained from other approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Yamin, H.

Testability analysis and scalable test generation for high-speed floating-point units,"High-speed datapaths in microprocessors and embedded processors contain complex floating-point ( FP) arithmetic units which have a critical role in the processor's performance. Although the FP units' complex structure consists of classic integer arithmetic components, the embedded components encounter serious testability problems due to their limited accessibility from the FP unit ports and testability loss due to FP unit inherent operations, such as rounding and normalization. In this paper, we analyze the testability problems and present scalable test generation for FP units using as a demonstration vehicle the popular, high-speed, two-path architecture of the most complex unit, the FP adder. The key feature of the presented methodology is the identification of testability conditions that guarantee effective test pattern application and fault propagation for each of the components of the FP adder. The identified test conditions can be utilized with respect to any fault model and are independent of the internal structure and the size of the components. Thus, they can be applied to FP adders of various exponent and significand sizes ( single, double, and custom precision), as well as to other types of FP units, which also consist of classic integer arithmetic components similarly interconnected.","Xenoulis, George; Psarakis, Mihalis; Gizopoulos, Dimitris; Paschalis, Antonis",2006.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS,10.1109/TC.2006.187,https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.187
Is HIV screening being requested appropriately? The experience of a Victorian public health laboratory,"From the start of clinical testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody in 1985 until the end of June 1994, the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit tested 134 346 serum samples from 109 391 individuals, identifying 672 as infected. A suitable database, using coded identities, was established from the beginning. Because the sera came from a variety of clinical settings, it was possible to extract information about patterns of requests for tests and about the yield of seropositive cases. The data were able to highlight factors associated with high rates of positive tests that can be lost in amalgamated statewide data. The discovery of HIV-positive females was sporadic and there was a much lower detection rate than from testing males. While males were most commonly diagnosed through specialist venereology services, 61 per cent of diagnoses in females were through nonspecialised practices, often those without previous experience in diagnosis and management of HIV infection. Despite some individual exceptions, the requesting of Hr tests appears generally to have been justifiable (particularly in view of the direction of official preventive campaigns) and not profligate. Overall, where practice was unsatisfactory, this lay less in thoughtless ordering of tests than in failing to include with the specimen the elementary, but vital, epidemiological information requested.","Darlington, R; Thompson, SC; Forsyth, JRL",1996.0,AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,10.1111/j.1467-842X.1996.tb01024.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-842X.1996.tb01024.x
An Optimized Cell BE Special Function Library Generated by Coconut,"Coconut, a tool for developing high-assurance, high-performance kernels for scientific computing, contains an extensible domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Haskell. The DSL supports interactive prototyping and unit testing, simplifying the process of designing efficient implementations of common patterns. Unscheduled C and scheduled assembly language output are supported. Using the patterns, even nonexpert users can write efficient function implementations, leveraging special hardware features. A production-quality library of elementary functions for the Cell BE SPU compute engines has been developed. Coconut-generated and -scheduled vector functions were more than four times faster than commercially distributed functions written in C with intrinsics (a nicer syntax for in-line assembly), wrapped in loops and scheduled by spuxIc. All Coconut functions were faster, but the difference was larger for hard-to-approximate functions for which register-level SIMD lookups made a bigger difference. Other helpful features in the language include facilities for translating interval and polynomial descriptions between GHCi, a Haskell interpreter used to prototype in the DSL, and Maple, used for exploration and minimax polynomial generation. This makes it easier to match mathematical properties of the functions with efficient calculational patterns in the SPU ISA. By using single, literate source files, the resulting functions are remarkably readable.","Anand, Christopher Kumar; Kahl, Wolfram",2009.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS,10.1109/TC.2008.223,https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.223
Pattern-based design applied to cultural heritage knowledge graphs,"Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) have become an established and recognised practice for guaranteeing good quality ontology engineering. There are several ODP repositories where ODPs are shared as well as ontology design methodologies recommending their reuse. Performing rigorous testing is recommended as well for supporting ontology maintenance and validating the resulting resource against its motivating requirements. Nevertheless, it is less than straightforward to find guidelines on how to apply such methodologies for developing domain-specific knowledge graphs. ArCo is the knowledge graph of Italian Cultural Heritage and has been developed by using eXtreme Design (XD), an ODP- and test-driven methodology. During its development, XD has been adapted to the need of the CH domain e.g. gathering requirements from an open, diverse community of consumers, a new ODP has been defined and many have been specialised to address specific CH requirements. This paper presents ArCo and describes how to apply XD to the development and validation of a CH knowledge graph, also detailing the (intellectual) process implemented for matching the encountered modelling problems to ODPs. Relevant contributions also include a novel web tool for supporting unit-testing of knowledge graphs, a rigorous evaluation of ArCo, and a discussion of methodological lessons learned during ArCo's development.","Carriero, Valentina Anita; Gangemi, Aldo; Mancinelli, Maria Letizia; Nuzzolese, Andrea Giovanni; Presutti, Valentina; Veninata, Chiara",2021.0,SEMANTIC WEB,10.3233/SW-200422,https://doi.org/10.3233/SW-200422
SimilaR: R Code Clone and Plagiarism Detection,"Third-party software for assuring source code quality is becoming increasingly popular. Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit tests, perform static code analysis, or inspect run-time memory use are crucial in the software development life cycle. More sophisticated methods allow for performing meta-analyses of large software repositories, e.g., to discover abstract topics they relate to or common design patterns applied by their developers. They may be useful in gaining a better understanding of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as detecting plagiarism in programming classes. A meaningful measure of similarity of computer programs often forms the basis of such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments for similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable for analysing R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather simple techniques and heuristics and fail to provide a user with the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for working with R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR package. It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but also for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked by applying some obfuscation techniques or imputing dead code. We demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency in a real-world case study.","Bartoszuk, Maciej; Gagolewski, Marek",2020.0,R JOURNAL,,https://doi.org/
Use and utility of serologic tests for rheumatoid arthritis in primary care,"INTRODUCTION: In this retrospective, register-based population study, we evaluated if anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) is a better choice than immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor (IgM RF) in primary care, when rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is suspected, as it determines predictive values in real-life settings. Furthermore, the study described ordering patterns to investigate the benefit of repeated testing. METHODS: Test result, requisitioning unit, test date and the patient's social security number were collected from the Department of Clinical Immunology at Odense University Hospital in 2007-2016 and merged with patient diagnoses from the Danish National Patient Registry. RESULTS: Overall, 5% were diagnosed with RA. IgM RF remained the preferred test during the entire period. Test sensitivity was 61% for IgM RF and 54% for ACPA. The test specificity was 88% for IgM RF and 96% for ACPA. PPV was higher for ACPA than for IgM RF (30% versus 12%) and NPV was equal (99%) in primary care. Few individuals seroconverted from negative to positive (ACPA 2% and IgM RF 5%) and positive to negative (ACPA 3% and IgM RF 6%). CONCLUSIONS: ACPA has a higher PPV for RA than IgM RF, whereas their NPV is identical. ACPA is the better choice when testing for RA in primary care. Seroconversion is rare, and it is only rarely relevant to retest.","Tenstad, Helene Broch; Nilsson, Anna Christine; Dellgren, Christoffer Dalsgaard; Lindegaard, Hanne Merete; Rubin, Katrine Hass; Lillevang, Soren Thue",2020.0,DANISH MEDICAL JOURNAL,,https://doi.org/
A proposed formulation for multi-objective renewable economic load dispatch,"The economic development, rising global temperatures, urbanization, and rapid population increase are some prominent factors that have resulted in increased electricity demand worldwide. The burning of fossil fuels to meet the industrial electricity demand is leading to deleterious environmental effects. Economic load dispatch (ELD) is an optimization problem that determines an optimum way in terms of cost-effectiveness and emission minimization, for generating power by utilizing the electricity generation resources. Global climatic concerns are driving the researchers to spread the scope of ELD and include unconventional and renewable sources. This research work proposes a combination of three major renewable energy sources with thermal power sources (solar, wind and hydro). The proposed objective function includes a large number of major constraints related to each of the included sources which have not been combined before. The pattern search algorithm has been implemented on IEEE 40 unit test system combining wind, solar and hydro power generating units to observe the results.

Simulation results show that the problem formulation and inclusion of respective constraints bring authenticity to the system and produce accurate results.","Mir, Jamaluddin; Kasim, Shahreen; Mahdin, Hairulnizam; Saedudin, Rd Rohmat; Hassan, Rohayanti; Ramlan, Rohaizan",,JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,10.1007/s12652-021-03691-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-021-03691-y
Web Services-based Report Generation System from Big Data in the Manufacturing Industry based on Agile Software Development,"In the manufacturing industry, there are many information technology (IT) systems and machines connected to different databases with complex big data. In this study, the web service system is developed by using different programming languages consisting of C#, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Ext JS and structured query language (SQL). In addition to these programming languages, model view controller (MVC), a software design pattern is also used for developing a database interface. The development of this system allows the web service system to search for reports that meet the user needs and also has the user interface (UI) for convenience and speed. In this study, agile software development method is used in accordance with scrum framework, which consist of 4 steps: 1) product backlog creation, 2) sprint backlog creation, 3) sprint or the system development and testing and test case writing and 4) daily scrum. Sprint review is held to report the results of unit test, functional test, integration test and user acceptance test (UAT). This sprint review enables the development of an appropriate and comprehensive system and results in collaboration and understanding among stakeholders, including technology adoption among users.","Kattiyawong, Plueksaporn; Tangprasert, Sakchai",2020.0,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ICEIS), VOL 1",10.5220/0009459102260232,https://doi.org/10.5220/0009459102260232
Incorporating Software Performance Engineering Methods and Practices into the Software Development Life Cycle,"In many software development projects, attention is only paid to performance concerns after functional testing, when it usually too late to remedy disabling performance problems. Early attention to performance concerns and early planning of performance requirements and performance testing can prevent debacles like the early rollout of healthcare. gov while addressing cross-cutting concerns such as scalability, reliability and, security. Performance engineering methods may be integrated into all phases of the software lifecycle, from the conception of a system to requirements specification, architecture, testing, and finally to production. Performance expectations can be managed by carefully specifying performance requirements. Reviewing the architecture of a system before design and implementation take place reduces the risk of designing a system that contains inherent performance vice. Performance modeling can be used to justify architectural and design decisions and to plan performance tests. The outputs of such performance tests enable us able to identify concurrent programming and other issues that would not be apparent in unit testing. Finally, risk is mitigated by avoiding design antipatterns that undermine scalability and performance.","Bondi, Andre B.",2016.0,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 ACM/SPEC INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING (ICPE'16),10.1145/2851553.2858668,https://doi.org/10.1145/2851553.2858668
Kokkos: Enabling manycore performance portability through polymorphic memory access patterns,"The manycore revolution can be characterized by increasing thread counts, decreasing memory per thread, and diversity of continually evolving manycore architectures. High performance computing (HPC) applications and libraries must exploit increasingly finer levels of parallelism within their codes to sustain scalability on these devices. A major obstacle to performance portability is the diverse and conflicting set of constraints on memory access patterns across devices. Contemporary portable programming models address manycore parallelism (e.g., OpenMP, OpenACC, OpenCL) but fail to address memory access patterns. The Kokkos C++ library enables applications and domain libraries to achieve performance portability on diverse manycore architectures by unifying abstractions for both fine-grain data parallelism and memory access patterns. In this paper we describe Kokkos' abstractions, summarize its application programmer interface (API), present performance results for unit-test kernels and mini-applications, and outline an incremental strategy for migrating legacy C++ codes to Kokkos. The Kokkos library is under active research and development to incorporate capabilities from new generations of manycore architectures, and to address a growing list of applications and domain libraries.

Influence of confirmation biases of developers on software quality: an empirical study,"The thought processes of people have a significant impact on software quality, as software is designed, developed and tested by people. Cognitive biases, which are defined as patterned deviations of human thought from the laws of logic and mathematics, are a likely cause of software defects. However, there is little empirical evidence to date to substantiate this assertion. In this research, we focus on a specific cognitive bias, confirmation bias, which is defined as the tendency of people to seek evidence that verifies a hypothesis rather than seeking evidence to falsify a hypothesis. Due to this confirmation bias, developers tend to perform unit tests to make their program work rather than to break their code. Therefore, confirmation bias is believed to be one of the factors that lead to an increased software defect density. In this research, we present a metric scheme that explores the impact of developers' confirmation bias on software defect density. In order to estimate the effectiveness of our metric scheme in the quantification of confirmation bias within the context of software development, we performed an empirical study that addressed the prediction of the defective parts of software. In our empirical study, we used confirmation bias metrics on five datasets obtained from two companies. Our results provide empirical evidence that human thought processes and cognitive aspects deserve further investigation to improve decision making in software development for effective process management and resource allocation.","Calikli, Gul; Bener, Ayse Basar",2013.0,SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL,10.1007/s11219-012-9180-0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11219-012-9180-0
A modern approach to QENS data analysis in Mantid,"Data analysis of Quasi-elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) experiments often requires multiple steps involving fitting the elastic and quasi-elastic parts of spectra with several empirical functions and analytical models. Parameters of those models can be interdependent and also dependent on the momentum transfer vector Q. Here we present a modern data analysis interface dedicated for QENS data analysis implemented within the open source software Mantid. The interface has been implemented using the state-of-the-art design pattern ModelView-Presenter (MVP). The MVP, an architectural software design pattern, facilitates automated unit tests as well as decoupling of the business logic, presentation logic and the graphical interface. Several models are implemented for analysing both elastic and quasi-elastic parts of the dynamical scattering function S(Q,omega) and intermediate scattering function I(Q, t). To understand the nature of dynamics in a QENS experiments, several models are also implemented for elastic incoherent structure factor (EISF) and jump diffusions. The interface has been validated by analysing a sample of liquid water at room temperature. The nature of hydrogen bond dynamics of the hydrogen bonded organic ferroelectric 2, 4, 5 - Br-3 imidazole, for the first time has been analysed using this newly implemented software. It is found that protons exhibit localised random motion in this material.","Mukhopadhyay, Sanghamitra; Hewer, Brandon; Howells, Spencer; Markvardsen, Anders",2019.0,PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER,10.1016/j.physb.2019.02.041,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physb.2019.02.041
The Convergence of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) Emissions Per Capita in China,"As the third-largest SO2 emitter in the world, China is facing mounting domestic and external pressure to tackle the increasingly serious SO2 pollution. Figuring out the convergence and persistence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions matters much for environmental policymakers in China. This study mainly utilizes the Fourier quantile unit root test to survey the convergence of the SO2 emissions per capita in 74 cities of China during the period of December 2014 to June 2019, by conducting five traditional unit root tests and a quantile root unit test as a comparative analysis. The empirical results indicate that the SO2 emissions per capita in 72 out of 74 cities in China are convergent in the sample period. The results also suggest that the unit root behavior of the SO2 emissions per capita in these cities is asymmetrically persistent at different quantiles. For the cities with the convergent SO2 emissions, the government should consider the asymmetric mean-reverting pattern of SO2 emissions when implementing environmental protection policies at different stages. For Hefei and Nanjing, the local governments need to enact stricter environmental protection policies to control the emission of sulfur dioxide.","Zhang, Yu-Chen; Si, Deng-Kui; Zhao, Bing",2020.0,SUSTAINABILITY,10.3390/su12051781,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12051781
A quantitative analysis of the unit verification perspective on fault distributions in complex software systems: an operational replication,"Unit verification, including software inspections and unit tests, is usually the first code verification phase in the software development process. However, principles of unit verification are weakly explored, mostly due to the lack of data, since unit verification data are rarely systematically collected and only a few studies have been published with such data from industry. Therefore, we explore the theory of fault distributions, originating in the quantitative analysis by Fenton and Ohlsson, in the weakly explored context of unit verification in large-scale software development. We conduct a quantitative case study on a sequence of four development projects on consecutive releases of the same complex software product line system for telecommunication exchanges. We replicate the operationalization from earlier studies, analyzed hypotheses related to the Pareto principle of fault distribution, persistence of faults, effects of module size, and quality in terms of fault densities, however, now from the perspective of unit verification. The patterns in unit verification results resemble those of later verification phases, e.g., regarding the Pareto principle, and may thus be used for prediction and planning purposes. Using unit verification results as predictors may improve the quality and efficiency of software verification.","Grbac, Tihana Galinac; Runeson, Per; Huljenic, Darko",2016.0,SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL,10.1007/s11219-015-9273-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11219-015-9273-7
SPOC online video learning clustering analysis: Identifying learners' group behavior characteristics,"With the widespread of Small Private Online Courses (SPOC) in colleges and universities, course organizers who provide high-quality personalized course activities need to understand learners' learning status and characteristics, and then optimize the course teaching. However, little research has been done on different learners' group behavior characteristics, such as which indicators can reflect learner groups' behavior, and what are the typical behavior characteristics of different learner groups. In this work, we established a Python Language Foundation self-built SPOC course, and 109 undergraduates' learning behavior data were collected and analyzed. From 74-dimensional behavior log data consisting of 72 video-viewing, course video score, and comprehensive score, Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce dimensionality. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to divide learners into different categories, and the results showed that 15 groups are clustered. According to the analysis of the four indicators for group characteristics, which are the completion and viewing-stability of task-point videos, unit test excellence, and comprehensive score, it is identified into five primary types, including positive type, regular type, negative type, semi-negative type, and a fluctuation type. Experiments conducted on a real data set across different academic years and courses show that the proposed approach has better clustering accuracy and practicability. It is expected that this work may be used to strengthen the personalized learning support services system in educational institutions and develop a tool that integrates exploration and analysis work onto the web platform.","Li, Fei; Lu, Yang; Ma, Qiang; Gao, Juntao; Wang, Zhibao; Bai, Lu",,COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION,10.1002/cae.22624,https://doi.org/10.1002/cae.22624
Structure design of multi-functional flexible electrocardiogram electrodes based on PEDOT:PSS-coated fabrics,"Herein, Polyester woven fabrics as the matrices for the experimental group, while cotton knitted fabrics, cotton woven fabrics, and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) mesh cloth used as the matrices for the control groups, at 40 degrees e, using 3,4-ethoxylene dioxy thiophene (EDOT)as the polymer monomer, FeCl3 as the oxidant, and poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as the dopant, are separately coated with PEDOT:PSS polymer to prepare flexible conductive composite fabrics. The influences of the fabric pattern, oxidant concentration, and monomer concentration on the electrical performance of composite fabrics are optimized. The maximal electrical conductivity of PET-based composite fabrics (218 S/m) occurs when monomer concentration is 0.035 mol/L, the molar ratio of oxidant to monomer is 2.5, and the dopant concentration is 2.5 g/L. Moreover, bacteriostasis rate of this composite fabric reaches 71.8%. Furthermore, by electrocardiogram (ECG) simulated human body unit test as well as human body ECG test, the optimal PET-based composite fabric electrode both has a lower impedance which helps form the stabilized ECG signal. The resulting fabric electrodes retain the soft and breathable advantages from fabrics and reduce the discomfort for a long-term use of conventional electrographic gel, thereby validating the empirical evidence for mobile, portable, wearable ECG electrodes.","Lin, Jia-Horng; Fu, Xiangdong; Li, Ting-Ting; Zhang, Xuefei; Zhao, Bobo; Shiu, Bing-Chiuan; Wang, Huiquan; Jiang, Qian; Lou, Ching-Wen",2022.0,JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES,10.1177/15280837211022637,https://doi.org/10.1177/15280837211022637
Tests as Maintainable Assets Via Auto-generated Spies A case study involving the Scala collections library's Iterator trait,"In testing stateful abstractions, it is often necessary to record interactions, such as method invocations, and express assertions over these interactions. Following the Test Spy design pattern, we can reify such interactions programmatically through additional mutable state. Alternatively, a mocking framework, such as Mockito, can automatically generate test spies that allow us to record the interactions and express our expectations in a declarative domain-specific language. According to our study of the test code for Scala's Iterator trait, the latter approach can lead to a significant reduction of test code complexity in terms of metrics such as code size (in some cases over 70% smaller), cyclomatic complexity, and amount of additional mutable state required. In this tools paper, we argue that the resulting test code is not only more maintainable, readable, and intentional, but also a better stylistic match for the Scala community than manually implemented, explicitly stateful test spies.","Laufer, Konstantin; O'Sullivan, John; Thiruvathukal, George K.",2019.0,SCALA'19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH ACM SIGPLAN INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SCALA,10.1145/3337932.3338814,https://doi.org/10.1145/3337932.3338814
Effect of Continuous Integration on Build Health in Undergraduate Team Projects,"We present the results of an analysis of the changing patterns of build health across three cohorts of undergraduate students, in a compulsory software engineering course unit. In the course unit, student teams were asked to make changes to a large open source software system, and to maintain clean release builds as they did so. Release build health (in terms of compiling code and passing unit tests) was explicitly included in the marking scheme for the coursework. We set up a continuous integration server to keep track of student build health. Initially, this was used only by TAs in marking student work, but for later cohorts we provided access to continuous integration results to all students from the early stages of each exercise. This has provided us with data on the changing patterns of student build health, with differing access to the CI server, giving an insight into how students learn to manage build health and the effects of allowing them access to CI results. We found evidence of a clear improvement in ability to manage build health when CI facilities are made available, but that some student teams were not making use of the facilities to much effect. The improvement effect was strongest on the build health of release builds, corresponding to the area of greatest marks in the marking scheme. The CI results also proved to be very valuable for academic staff, in making the problems with student builds visible.","Embury, Suzanne M.; Page, Christopher",2019.0,"SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ASPECTS OF CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND NEW PARADIGMS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTION AND DEPLOYMENT, DEVOPS 2018",10.1007/978-3-030-06019-0_13,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-06019-0_13
Removing Decorator to Improve Energy Efficiency,"With growing concerns regarding climate change and rising energy costs, there is an increased focus on improving the energy efficiency of software. One relevant avenue of research is the transformation of software designs in order to increase efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Design Patterns are of interest here as the indirection they introduce is likely to have a detrimental effect on energy consumption. In this paper we report on our investigations into the impact on energy consumption of the Decorator pattern, which is a structural design pattern used to enable additional behaviour to be attached to an individual component dynamically. Application of this pattern improves the maintainability of software at the cost of increased indirection and redundancy, which may reduce energy efficiency. In this paper we explore features of the Decorator pattern that impact on its systematic removal, with a future goal of removing this pattern using automated refactoring. We subsequently examine experimentally the Decorator pattern's impact on energy consumption in Java and find its implementation results in an increased number of instantiated objects and method invocations at run-time. The removal of the pattern can result in up to a 96% reduction in energy consumption in a best-case scenario with a textbook example, and up to a 5% reduction in energy consumption in an open-source project with a case study examining JUnit, a popular unit testing framework for Java. These results demonstrate the energy savings achievable with the removal of Decorator pattern instances and open the way for similar investigations of other design patterns.","Bree, Deaglan Connolly; Cinneide, Mel O.",2022.0,"2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ANALYSIS, EVOLUTION AND REENGINEERING (SANER 2022)",10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00108,https://doi.org/10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00108
Model-based testing leveraged for automated web tests,"Agile methods and their practices have fostered the widespread presence of automated test cases. Such test cases have been successfully and extensively adopted to test different software levels, from unit tests (e.g., JUnit) to end-to-end Web Graphical User Interface (GUI) tests (e.g., Selenium Webdriver). While test execution is mostly automated by existing tools, test design remains a manual task. In the pursuit of a more automated test case generation approach, the use of models has been advocated by the model-based testing (MBT) technique. Current MBT approaches assume a top-down workflow in which testers design models, test cases are generated from models, and then scripts are written to automate test execution. Nevertheless, writing automated tests is nowadays a developer's responsibility and testers face a scenario in which automated tests might be reused to produce new model-based tests. This paper aimed to improve the synergy between existing automated tests and MBT. To do so, we present an approach that infers a model from existing tests, a tester leverages this model to include new tests, and then test code is generated. We analyzed the proposed approach in the context of Web applications with system-level GUI tests that employ the Page Object pattern. For MBT, we adopted event-driven models augmented with parameters and test input data. We evaluated the approach's applicability with a prototype tool called MoLeWe and an experimental study with nine open-source Web applications. The results provide some evidence that using MoLeWe may help to include new tests faster than manually coding them, while increasing the overall code coverage of the test suite.","Mattiello, Guilherme Ricken; Endo, Andre Takeshi",2022.0,SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL,10.1007/s11219-021-09575-w,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11219-021-09575-w
Free the Bugs: Disclosing Blocking Violations in Reactive Programming,"In programming, concurrency allows threads to share processing units interleaving and seemingly simultaneous to improve resource utilization and performance. Previous research has found that concurrency faults are hard to avoid, hard to find, often leading to undesired and unpredictable behavior. Further, with the growing availability of multi-core devices and adaptation of concurrency features in high-level languages, concurrency faults occur reportedly often, which is why countermeasures must be investigated to limit harm. Reactive programming provides an abstraction to simplify complex concurrent and asynchronous tasks through reactive language extensions such as the RxJava and Project Reactor libraries for Java. Still, blocking violations are possibly resulting in concurrency faults with no Java compiler warnings. BlockHound is a tool that detects incorrect blocking by wrapping the original code and intercepting blocking calls to provide appropriate runtime errors. In this study, we seek an understanding of how common blocking violations are and whether a tool such as BlockHound can give us insight into the root-causes to highlight them as pitfalls to developers. The investigated Softwares are Java-based open-source projects using reactive frameworks selected based on high star ratings and large fork quantities that indicate high adoption. We activated BlockHound in the project's test-suites and analyzed log files for common patterns to reveal blocking violations in 7/29 investigated open-source projects with 5024 stars and 1437 forks. A small number of system calls could be identified as root-causes. We here present countermeasures that successfully removed the uncertainty of blocking violations. The code's intentional logic was retained in all validated projects through passing unit-tests.","Dobslaw, Felix; Vallin, Morgan; Sundstrom, Robin",2020.0,2020 20TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKING CONFERENCE ON SOURCE CODE ANALYSIS AND MANIPULATION (SCAM 2020),10.1109/SCAM51674.2020.00025,https://doi.org/10.1109/SCAM51674.2020.00025
A Feasibility Study of Autonomically Detecting In-process Cyber-Attacks,"A cyber-attack detection system issues alerts when an attacker attempts to coerce a trusted software application to perform unsafe actions on the attacker's behalf. One way of issuing such alerts is to create an application-agnostic cyber-attack detection system that responds to prevalent software vulnerabilities. The creation of such an autonomic alert system, however, is impeded by the disparity between implementation language, function, Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements, and architectural patterns present in applications, all of which contribute to the rapidly changing threat landscape presented by modern heterogeneous software systems. This paper evaluates the feasibility of creating an autonomic cyber-attack detection system and applying it to several exemplar web-based applications using program transformation and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we examine whether it is possible to detect cyber-attacks (1) online, i.e., as they occur using lightweight structures derived from a call graph and (2) offline, i.e., using machine learning techniques trained with features extracted from a trace of application execution. In both cases, we first characterize normal application behavior using supervised training with the test suites created for an application as part of the software development process. We then intentionally perturb our test applications so they are vulnerable to common attack vectors and then evaluate the effectiveness of various feature extraction and learning strategies on the perturbed applications. Our results show that both lightweight on-line models based on control flow of execution path and application specific off-line models can successfully and efficiently detect in-process cyber-attacks against web applications.","Sun, Fangzhou; Zhang, Peng; White, Jules; Schmidt, Douglas C.; Staples, Jacob; Krause, Lee",2017.0,2017 3RD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBERNETICS (CYBCONF),,https://doi.org/
CNN-Based Fault Localization Method Using Memory-Updated Patterns for Integration Test in an HiL Environment,"Automotive electronic components are tested via hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) testing at the unit and integration test stages, according to ISO 26262. It is difficult to obtain debugging information from the HiL test because the simulator runs a black-box test automatically, depending on the scenario in the test script. At this time, debugging information can be obtained in HiL tests, using memory-updated information, without the source code or the debugging tool. However, this method does not know when the fault occurred, and it is difficult to select the starting point of debugging if the execution flow of the software is not known. In this paper, we propose a fault-localization method using a pattern in which each memory address is updated in the HiL test. Via a sequential pattern-mining algorithm in the memory-updated information of the transferred unit tests, memory-updated patterns are extracted, and the system learns using a convolutional neural network. Applying the learned pattern in the memory-updated information of the integration test can determine the fault point from the normal pattern. The point of departure from the normal pattern is highlighted as a fault-occurrence time, and updated addresses are presented as fault candidates. We applied the proposed method to an HiL test of an OSEK/VDX-based electronic control unit. Through fault-injection testing, we could find the cause of faults by checking the average memory address of 3.28%, and we could present the point of fault occurrence with an average accuracy of 80%.","Choi, Ki-Yong; Lee, Jung-Won",2019.0,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,10.3390/app9142799,https://doi.org/10.3390/app9142799
"Developer Testing in the IDE: Patterns, Beliefs, and Behavior","Software testing is one of the key activities to achieve software quality in practice. Despite its importance, however, we have a remarkable lack of knowledge on how developers test in real-world projects. In this paper, we report on a large-scale field study with 2,443 software engineers whose development activities we closely monitored over 2.5 years in four integrated development environments (IDEs). Our findings, which largely generalized across the studied IDEs and programming languages Java and C#, question several commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about developer testing: half of the developers in our study do not test; developers rarely run their tests in the IDE; most programming sessions end without any test execution; only once they start testing, do they do it extensively; a quarter of test cases is responsible for three quarters of all test failures; 12 percent of tests show flaky behavior; Test-Driven Development (TDD) is not widely practiced; and software developers only spend a quarter of their time engineering tests, whereas they think they test half of their time. We summarize these practices of loosely guiding one's development efforts with the help of testing in an initial summary on Test-Guided Development (TGD), a behavior we argue to be closer to the development reality of most developers than TDD.","Beller, Moritz; Gousios, Georgios; Panichella, Annibale; Proksch, Sebastian; Amann, Sven; Zaidman, Andy",2019.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1109/TSE.2017.2776152,https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2017.2776152
Improved grey wolf optimization technique for fuzzy aided PID controller design for power system frequency control,"Frequency regulation of power systems by fuzzy aided PID controller is proposed in this study. The controller gains are optimized by an Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO) method. The improvement inGWOmethod is done by an approach which does not consider less important delta wolves for updating the position vector in the hunting stages of the algorithm thus making the algorithm simpler with less implementation time. Proposed IGWO is initially evaluated using some standard test functions. The outcomes are equated with GWO, modified GWO (MGWO), Differential Evolution (DE), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques to illustrate its supremacy. The IGWO algorithm is then employed to optimize PID, hybridized structure of Fuzzy PD and cascade PI-PD(FPD/PI-PD) and fuzzy based PID parameters for frequency regulation of two-area power system. The superiority of fuzzy PID is established over recently proposed Automatic Generation Control (AGC) approaches. In the second stage, the methodology is applied to a two-area six-unit test system with diverse sources and supremacy of the proposed approach is established over optimal feedback controller, DE tuned PID and TLBO tuned 2DOF PID for the same test system. Finally, the suggested technique is used in a three area nonlinear test system and the supremacy of suggested approach over IGWO tuned FPD/PI-PD and hybrid Firefly Algorithm-Pattern Search (hFA-PS) tuned fuzzy PID is shown. Sensitivity study is conducted to show the ability of the suggested approach to perform satisfactorily with varied conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Sahoo, B.

Student perceptions of the progress test in two settings and the implications for test deployment,"Background The Progress Test (PT) was developed to assess student learning within integrated curricula. Whilst it is effective in promoting and rewarding deep approaches to learning in some settings, we hypothesised that implementation of the curriculum (design and assessment) may impact on students' preparation for the PT and their learning. Aim To compare students' perceptions of and preparations for the PT at two medical schools. Method Focus groups were used to generate items for a questionnaire. This was piloted, refined, and then delivered at both schools. Exploratory factor analysis identified the main factors underpinning response patterns. ANOVA was used to compare differences in response by school, year group and gender. Results Response rates were 640 (57%) and 414 (47%) at Schools A and B, respectively. Three major factors were identified: the PT's ability to (1) assess academic learning (2) support clinical learning; (3) the PT's impact on exam preparation. Significant differences were found between settings. In the school with early clinical contact, more frequent PTs and no end of unit tests, students were more likely to appreciate the PT as a support for learning, perceive it as fair and valid, and use a deeper approach to learning-but they also spent longer preparing for the test. Conclusion Different approaches to the delivery of the PT can impact significantly on student study patterns. The learning environment has an important impact on student perceptions of assessment and approach to learning. Careful decisions about PT deployment must be taken to ensure its optimal impact.","Wade, Louise; Harrison, Chris; Hollands, James; Mattick, Karen; Ricketts, Chris; Wass, Val",2012.0,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,10.1007/s10459-011-9334-z,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10459-011-9334-z
Leveraging Code-Test Co-evolution Patterns for Automated Test Case Recommendation,"Context: Prior research revealed that code components with similar structures tend to require structurally similar test cases and they often co-evolve over time. Objective: Leveraging this pattern, we implemented a prototype tool, Test Suite Evolver (TSE), to support the generation of test cases for structurally similar methods. Our prototype tool is applicable to both, incomplete test suites with the purpose of test case augmentation, as well as evolving test suites when a newer version of a software becomes available. Method: Making use of the aforementioned code-test co-evolution pattern, TSE leverages source code structural similarity and a set of existing test cases to synthesise and recommend new unit tests. For this, TSE initially identifies groups of structurally similar methods in the code, determines changes at the token-level, and integrates the retrieved information to synthesise updated test cases. Results: Our evaluations indicated that 38% of the source code of five large open-source applications consist of methods which are structurally similar to each other and therefore for which, the co-evolution pattern holds. Applying TSE to these methods, TSE generated 72% of the minimum required test cases with only 11% token-based edit distance between the generated test cases and those written by developers. To evaluate the test cases' validity, we used code2vec, a neural network to measure the structural and semantic similarity between the generated and developed test cases. The results indicated that TSE successfully generated test cases with a similarity measure of more than 80% in more than 95.6% of test cases and similarity measure of 100% for 88.35% of the test cases. Conclusion: The evaluations revealed that TSE is able to generate the majority of the necessary test cases with an insignificant amount of modifications required from the developers.","Shimmi, Samiha; Rahimi, Mona",2022.0,3RD ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION OF SOFTWARE TEST (AST 2022),10.1145/3524481.3527222,https://doi.org/10.1145/3524481.3527222
How do i refactor this? An empirical study on refactoring trends and topics in Stack Overflow,"An essential part of software maintenance and evolution, refactoring is performed by developers, regardless of technology or domain, to improve the internal quality of the system, and reduce its technical debt. However, choosing the appropriate refactoring strategy is not always straightforward, resulting in developers seeking assistance. Although research in refactoring is well-established, with several studies altering between the detection of refactoring opportunities and the recommendation of appropriate code changes, little is known about their adoption in practice. Analyzing the perception of developers is critical to understand better what developers consider to be problematic in their code and how they handle it. Additionally, there is a need for bridging the gap between refactoring, as research, and its adoption in practice, by extracting common refactoring intents that are more suitable for what developers face in reality. In this study, we analyze refactoring discussions on Stack Overflow through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments. Our results show that Stack Overflow is utilized by a diverse set of developers for refactoring assistance for a variety of technologies. Our observations show five areas that developers typically require help with refactoring- Code Optimization, Tools and IDEs, Architecture and Design Patterns, Unit Testing, and Database. We envision our findings better bridge the support between traditional (or academic) aspects of refactoring and their real-world applicability, including better tool support.","Peruma, Anthony; Simmons, Steven; AlOmar, Eman Abdullah; Newman, Christian D.; Mkaouer, Mohamed Wiem; Ouni, Ali",2022.0,EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,10.1007/s10664-021-10045-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-021-10045-x
Rules of thumb to increase the software quality through testing,"The software maintenance typically requires 40-80% of the overall project costs, and this considerable variability mostly depends on the software internal quality: the more the software is designed and implemented to constantly welcome new changes, the lower will be the maintenance costs. The internal quality is typically enforced through testing, which in turn also affects the development and maintenance costs. This is the reason why testing methodologies have become a major concern for any company that builds - or is involved in building - software. Although there is no testing approach that suits all contexts, we infer some general guidelines learned during the Development of the Italian Single-dish COntrol System (DISCOS), which is a project aimed at producing the control software for the three INAF radio telescopes (the Medicina and Noto dishes, and the newly-built SRT). These guidelines concern both the development and the maintenance phases, and their ultimate goal is to maximize the DISCOS software quality through a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) workflow beside a continuous delivery pipeline. We consider different topics and patterns; they involve the proper apportion of the tests (from end-to-end to low-level tests), the choice between hardware simulators and mockers, why and how to apply TDD and the dependency injection to increase the test coverage, the emerging technologies available for test isolation, bug fixing, how to protect the system from the external resources changes (firmware updating, hardware substitution, etc.) and, eventually, how to accomplish BDD starting from functional tests and going through integration and unit tests. We discuss pros and cons of each solution and point out the motivations of our choices either as a general rule or narrowed in the context of the DISCOS project.","Buttu, M.; Bartolini, M.; Migoni, C.; Orlati, A.; Poppi, S.; Righini, S.",2016.0,SOFTWARE AND CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE FOR ASTRONOMY IV,10.1117/12.2230626,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2230626
Robust qualification flows for DRC decks using high coverage synthetic layout generation,"Design rules are geometric constraints imposed on IC layout to ensure products can be manufactured at an acceptable yield. Designs are required to pass sign-off design rule check (DRC) before tape-out. Foundries rely on DRC to ensure designs they accept are manufacturable. DRC runsets must be accurate, complete, and reliable. DRC runset qualification is critical in technology node deployment and maturation. The number, complexity and variation of design rules grow dramatically with advancing technology nodes. This increases the QA challenge to ensure quality and accuracy of runsets and their interdependent rule operations. Traditional methods of migrating previous node QA patterns, manually crafting new testcases, and targeted-pattern generation leave gaps in advanced process node qualification coverage. We deploy a novel synthetic layout generation approach to produce large varieties of complex layouts with high design space coverage to thoroughly qualify runsets, make runset improvements and release quality PDKs. We employ guided random Monte Carlo layout generation with user-defined layout construction rules. User-defined rules inform DRC requirements and assign weighted priorities to guide layout design styles. We generate stress DR layouts and high pattern coverage, with DRC-clean patterns and with deliberate DRC violations, to validate expected DRC results and exercise entire rule decks. In this paper, we show how Synthetic Layout Generation is integrated into runset QA flows, automatically generating stress DR conditions that manual efforts often miss, expand layout pattern space coverage, and improve runset execution coverage leading to higher quality on-time PDK development, qualification, and release.","Abdelmeged, Ramy G.; Balagowni, Srinivas; Abdelaleem, Ahmed; Kwan, Joe; Kabeel, Aliaa; Rizk, Sarah; Abouzeid, Ahmed",2022.0,DTCO AND COMPUTATIONAL PATTERNING,10.1117/12.2614085,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2614085
System Test Architecture Evaluation: A Probabilistic Modeling Approach,"In this paper, we study the effects of testing architecture on system quality using a probabilistic model of unit testing. The Markovian view of the testing process relates unit quality and test quality to the expected unit/system quality, and to the expected number of tests. The model is based on replicating testing where the test is replicated only after a fail test outcome. A set of equations are generalized for many component systems. The study enables the costs and associated benefits for particular groups of components to be considered for module testing at different levels of system hierarchy. Simulation results show that the selection of an appropriate testing architecture and modular architecture can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of system testing. The model is applied to several testing architectures and test patterns to illustrate the tradeoff comparisons that can be made between different system architectures in terms of the overall test cost and the resulting system quality. Several heuristics are derived to assist in planning tests of complex systems for optimizing quality and cost before systems are built. This Markovian model of testability in systems shows promise for use from the modular unit build-level in engineering manufacture development through to strategizing portfolio-level integration and information assurance testing of new capability projects with legacy systems in a family-of-systems. The early abstract testability work reinforces the benefits of iterating testing as early and often as possible. Following trials to validate the model in different contexts and to refine the interface with systems engineers, this testability model could be added to other design for six-sigma tools and techniques to better enable systems engineering practitioners to tradeoff on testability options well before testing starts.","Efatmaneshnik, Mahmoud; Shoval, Shraga; Joiner, Keith",2019.0,IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL,10.1109/JSYST.2019.2899697,https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2019.2899697
"Temporal learning analytics to explore traces of self-regulated learning behaviors and their associations with learning performance, cognitive load, and student engagement in an asynchronous online course","Self-regulated learning (SRL) plays a critical role in asynchronous online courses. In recent years, attention has been focused on identifying student subgroups with different patterns of online SRL behaviors and comparing their learning performance. However, there is limited research leveraging traces of SRL behaviors to detect student subgroups and examine the subgroup differences in cognitive load and student engagement. The current study tracked the engagement of 101 graduate students with SRL-enabling tools integrated into an asynchronous online course. According to the recorded SRL behaviors, this study identified two distinct student subgroups, using sequence analysis and cluster analysis: high SRL (H-SRL) and low SRL (L-SRL) groups. The H-SRL group showed lower extraneous cognitive load and higher learning performance, germane cognitive load, and cognitive engagement than the L-SRL group did. Additionally, this study articulated and compared temporal patterns of online SRL behaviors between the student subgroups combining lag sequential analysis and epistemic network analysis. The results revealed that both groups followed three phases of self-regulation but performed off-task behaviors. Additionally, the H-SRL group preferred activating mastery learning goals to improve ethical knowledge, whereas the L-SRL group preferred choosing performance-avoidance learning goals to pass the unit tests. The H-SRL group invested more in time management and notetaking, whereas the L-SRL group engaged more in surface learning approaches. This study offers researchers both theoretical and methodological insights. Additionally, our research findings help inform practitioners about how to design and deploy personalized SRL interventions in asynchronous online courses.","Sun, Jerry Chih-Yuan; Liu, Yiming; Lin, Xi; Hu, Xiao",2023.0,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1096337,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1096337
Dynamic phasor measurement unit test system,"This paper presents the plans and progress towards the development of a dynamic phasor measurement unit (PMU) performance test system at NIST. We describe an algorithm for taking time-synchronized samples of single-phase voltage and current power signals and calculating their dynamic parameters, in particular the signal magnitude, phase, frequency, and rate of change of frequency that a PMU reports. PMUs must time stamp their values at periodic Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) markers called the update times. Thus, to provide a reference for PMU testing the sampled data can be fit to a model to define the value of a dynamic parameter at a specific time. The analysis model proposed in this paper assumes that the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters of the signals are constant over the sampling interval analyzed. This analysis interval is usually the same as the update period or an integer multiple of that period. In the proposed analysis model the dynamic magnitude and frequency parameters are considered a polynomial in time about the update times. The order of the polynomial can be adjusted in a way that meets the needs of the signal being analyzed, yet minimizes the computational effort and sensitivity to noise. We show that when the dynamic variations are analyzed in this way, a single matrix can be used to iteratively converge on a good estimate of the dynamic frequency and magnitude parameters. The polynomial model can be used to generate and analyze test signals. Several test patterns are proposed, which include linearly changing magnitudes or frequencies. As expected, during low voltage tests of the system, the analysis does very well when the generation model matches the analysis model. Several other generation models are also proposed, such as sine waves or damped sine waves. The proposed analysis model is shown to be very accurate in these cases as well.","Stenbakken, Gerard; Zhou, Ming",2007.0,"2007 IEEE POWER ENGINEERING SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING, VOLS 1-10",,https://doi.org/
BINAURAL MASKING LEVEL DIFFERENCE EFFECTS IN SINGLE UNITS OF THE GUINEA-PIG INFERIOR COLLICULUS,"We have studied the masking effects of a binaurally presented noise on the responses to binaural signals recorded from low-frequency cells in the inferior colliculus of the guinea pig. The spike rates to the masker and signal + masker were compared to quantify masking at different interaural time delays of the noise. The signal was a 50-ms tone burst at best frequency or a 50-ms segment of a synthetic vowel, presented at the best interaural delay of the unit tested. At each noise masker delay, the noise level was adjusted to obtain a criterion spike difference. In most cases, the level required was lowest at the best delay for the noise. The mean difference between maximum and minimum masked thresholds across the cell population was very similar to the human psychophysical masking level difference under the same signal and masker conditions. In another series of tests, we measured the effect of the noise masker on the temporal pattern of the discharge to the signal. The signal used was a 500-ms segment of the synthetic vowel. In virtually all cases the addition of a continuous noise masker reduced the discharge rate synchronized to the fundamental frequency of the vowel. The degree of this reduction was dependent on the interaural time delay of the noise masker. For most units, maximum reduction was seen when the vowel and noise had the same interaural time delay. The similarity between the masking which we have shown physiologically and that reported in a variety of human psychophysical experiments suggests that the processing at levels up to and including the inferior colliculus contributes to the psychophysical BMLD.","CAIRD, DM; PALMER, AR; REES, A",1991.0,HEARING RESEARCH,10.1016/0378-5955(91)90078-N,https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-5955(91)90078-N
Eclat: Automatic generation and classification of test inputs,"This paper describes a technique that selects, from a large set of test inputs, a small subset likely to reveal faults in the software under test. The technique takes a program or software component, plus a set of correct executions-say, from observations of the software running properly, or from an existing test suite that a user wishes to enhance. The technique first infers an operational model of the software's operation. Then, inputs whose operational pattern of execution differs from the model in specific ways are suggestive of faults. These inputs are further reduced by selecting only one input per operational pattern. The result is a small portion of the original inputs, deemed by the technique as most likely to reveal faults. Thus, the technique can also be seen as an error-detection technique. The paper describes two additional techniques that complement test input selection. One is a technique for automatically producing an oracle (a set of assertions) for a test input from the operational model, thus transforming the test input into a test case. The other is a classification-guided test input generation technique that also makes use of operational models and patterns. When generating inputs, it filters out code sequences that are unlikely to contribute to legal inputs, improving the efficiency of its search for fault-revealing inputs. We have implemented these techniques in the Eclat tool, which generates unit tests for Java classes. Eclat's input is a set of classes to test and an example program execution-say, a passing test suite. Eclat's output is a set of JUnit test cases, each containing a potentially fault-revealing input and a set of assertions at least one of which fails. In our experiments, Eclat successfully generated inputs that exposed fault-revealing behavior; we have used Eclat to reveal real errors in programs. The inputs it selects as fault-revealing are an order of magnitude as likely to reveal a fault as all generated inputs.","Pacheco, C; Ernst, MD",2005.0,"ECOOP 2005 - OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
Hemoglobin near-infrared spectroscopy and surface EMG study in muscle ischaemia and fatiguing isometric contraction,"Background. To assess how muscle ischaemia and isometric fatiguing contraction influence oxygen content in striated muscle. Methods. We simultaneously measured changes in hemoglobin near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and in surface EMG before, during, and after muscle ischaemia and ischaemia plus muscle isometric fatiguing contraction, Seventeen healthy male subjects (age range: 19-40 yrs) were examined in our Clinical Neurophysiology Unit. Test I (9 subjects): hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy and stimulated surface EMG were measured for 2 minutes at rest, for 4 minutes during complete ischaemia of tibialis anterior muscle, and for twelve minutes during recovery. Test II (all subjects): hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy and surface EMG were measured for 2 minutes with the subjects performing brief non-fatiguing contractions, for 4 minutes with the subject performing maximal isometric contraction in complete ischaemia, and for twelve minutes during recovery. EMG parameters measured: median density frequency (MDF); muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV). NIR spectroscopy parameters measured: percentage of amplitude decrement (%AD) and nadir time (NT) during ischaemia and ischaemic effort; half-recovery time (1/2 RT) from ischaemia effort. Results. At EMG, we observed a significant shift towards lower values of both MFCV and MDF during fatiguing isometric contraction, MDF recovery was faster then MFCV recovery. At NIR spectroscopy, the 1/2 RT slowed a fast pattern in twelve subjects and a slow pattern in five. 4 significant relationship was found between AD% and 1/2 RT values of test I and AD% and 1/2 values of test II, We found a positive relationship between NT and 1/2 RT in test II, Conclusions, Surface EMG and hemoglobin NIR spectroscopy can be applied simultaneously to evaluate both fatigue intensity and blood flow changes in striated muscle.","Alfonsi, E; Pavesi, R; Merlo, IM; Gelmetti, A; Zambarbieri, D; Lago, P; Arrigo, A; Reggiani, C; Moglia, A",1999.0,JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS,,https://doi.org/
Self-Reflection and Math Performance in an Online Learning Environment,"According to recent reports, K-12 full-time virtual school students have shown lower performance in math than their counterparts in brick-and-mortar schools. However, research is lacking in what kind of programmatic interventions virtual schools might be particularly well-suited to provide to improve math performance. Engaging students in self-reflection is a potentially promising pedagogical approach for supporting math learning. Nonetheless, it is unclear how models for math learning in brick and mortar classrooms translate in an online learning environment. The purpose of this study was to (a) analyze assessment data from virtual schools to explore the association between self-reflection and math performance, (b) compare the patterns found in student self-reflection across elementary, middle, and high school levels, and (c) examine whether providing opportunities for self-reflection had positive impact on math performance in an online learning environment. In this study, the self-reflection assessments were developed and administered multiple times within several math courses during the 2014-15 school year. These assessments included 47 questions that asked students to reflect on their understanding of the knowledge and skills they learned in the preceding lessons and units. Using these assessments, multiple constructs and indicators were measured, which included confidence about the topic knowledge/understanding, general feelings towards math, accuracy of self-judgment against actual test performance, and frequency of self-reflection. Through a series of three retrospective studies, data were collected from full-time virtual school students who took three math courses (one elementary, one middle, and one high school math course) in eight virtual schools in the United States during the 2013-14 and 2014-15 school years. The results showed that (a) participation in self-reflection varied by grade, unit test performance level, and course/topic difficulty; (b) more frequent participation in self-reflection and higher self-confidence level were associated with higher final course performance; and (c) self-reflection, as was implemented here, showed limited impact for more difficult topics, higher grade courses, and higher performing students. Implications for future research are provided.","Choi, Jinnie; Walters, Alyssa; Hoge, Pat",2017.0,ONLINE LEARNING,,https://doi.org/
Evidence for plateau potentials in tail motoneurons of awake chronic spinal rats with spasticity,"Motor units of segmental tail muscles were recorded in awake rats following acute (1-2 days) and chronic (>30 days) sacral spinal cord transection to determine whether plateau potentials contributed to sustained motor-unit discharges after injury. This study was motivated by a companion in vitro study that indicated that after chronic spinal cord injury, the tail motoneurons of the sacrocaudal spinal cord exhibit persistent inward currents (I-PIC) that cause intrinsically sustained depolarizations (plateau potentials) and firing (self-sustained firing). Importantly, in this companion study, the plateaus were fully activated at recruitment and subsequently helped sustain the firing without causing abrupt nonlinearities in firing. That is, after recruitment and plateau activation, the firing rate was modulated relatively linearly with injected current and therefore provided a good approximation of the input to the motoneuron despite the plateau. Thus in the present study, pairs of motor units were recorded simultaneously from the same muscle, and the firing rate (F) of the lowest-threshold unit (control unit) was used as an estimate of the synaptic input to both units. We then examined whether firing of the higher-threshold unit (test unit) was intrinsically maintained by a plateau, by determining whether more synaptic input was required to recruit the test unit than to maintain its firing. The difference in the estimated synaptic input at recruitment and de-recruitment of the test unit (i.e., change in control unit rate, DeltaF) was taken as an estimate of the plateau current (I-PIC) that intrinsically sustained the firing. Slowly graded manual skin stimulation was used to recruit and then de-recruit the units. The test unit was recruited when the control unit rate was on average 17.8 and 18.9 Hz in acute and chronic spinal rats, respectively. In chronic spinal rats, the test unit was de-recruited when the control unit rate (re: estimated synaptic input) was significantly reduced, compared with at recruitment (DeltaF = -5.5 Hz), and thus a plateau participated in maintaining the firing. In the lowest-threshold motor units, even a brief stimulation triggered very long-lasting firing (seconds to hours; self-sustained firing). Higher-threshold units required continuous stimulation (or a spontaneous spasm) to cause firing, but again more synaptic input was needed to recruit the unit than to maintain its firing (i.e., plateau present). In contrast, in acute spinal rats, the stimulation did not usually trigger sustained motor-unit firing that could be attributed to plateaus because DeltaF was not significantly different from zero. These results indicate that plateaus play an important role in sustaining motor-unit firing in awake chronic spinal rats and thus contribute to the hyperreflexia and hypertonus associated with chronic injury.","Bennett, DJ; Li, YR; Harvey, PJ; Gorassini, M",2001.0,JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY,10.1152/jn.2001.86.4.1972,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.2001.86.4.1972
Software Design for the VIS instrument onboard the Euclid mission: a multilayer approach,"The Euclid mission scientific payload is composed of two instruments: a VISible Imaging Instrument (VIS) and a Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer instrument (NISP). Each instrument has its own control unit. The Instrument Command and Data Processing Unit (VI-CDPU) is the control unit of the VIS instrument. The VI-CDPU is connected directly to the spacecraft by means of a MIL-STD-1553B bus and to the satellite Mass Memory Unit via a Space Wire link. All the internal interfaces are implemented via Space Wire links and include 12 high speed lines for the data provided by the 36 focal plane CCDs readout electronics (ROEs) and one link to the Power and Mechanisms Control Unit (VI-PMCU). VI-CDPU is in charge of distributing commands to the instrument sub-systems, collecting their housekeeping parameters and monitoring their health status. Moreover, the unit has the task of acquiring, reordering, compressing and transferring the science data to the satellite Mass Memory. This last feature is probably the most challenging one for the VI-CDPU, since stringent constraints about the minimum lossless compression ratio, the maximum time for the compression execution and the maximum power consumption have to be satisfied. Therefore, an accurate performance analysis at hardware layer is necessary, which could delay too much the design and development of software. In order to mitigate this risk, in the multilayered design of software we decided to design a middleware layer that provides a set of APIs with the aim of hiding the implementation of the HW connected layer to the application one. The middleware is built on top of the Operating System layer (which includes the Real-Time OS that will be adopted) and the onboard Computer Hardware. The middleware itself has a multi-layer architecture composed of 4 layers: the Abstract RTOS Adapter Layer (AOSAL), the Specific RTOS Adapter Layer (SOSAL), the Common Patterns Layer (CPL), the Service Layer composed of two subgroups which are the Common Service (CSL) and the Specific Service layer (SSL). The middleware design is made using the UML 2.0 standard. The AOSAL includes the abstraction of services provided by a generic RTOS (e.g Thread/Task, Time Management, Mutex and Semaphores) as well as an abstraction of Space Wire and 1553-B bus Interface. The SOSAL is the implementation of AOSAL for the adopted RTOS. The CPL provides a set of patterns that are a general solution for common problems related to embedded hard Real Time systems. This set includes patterns for memory management, homogenous redundancy channels, pipes and filters for data exchange, proxies for slow memories, watchdog and reactive objects. The CPL is designed using a soft-metamodeling approach, so as to be as general as possible. Finally, the SL provides a set of services that are common to space applications. The testing of this middleware can be done both during the design using appropriate tools of analysis and in the implementation phase by means of unit testing tools.","Galli, E.; Di Giorgio, A.

Test Driven Development: Advancing Knowledge by Conjecture and Confirmation,"Test Driven Development (TDD) is a critical agile software development practice that supports innovation in short development cycles. However, TDD is one of the most challenging agile practices to adopt because it requires changes to work practices and skill sets. It is therefore important to gain an understanding of TDD through the experiences of those who have successfully adopted this practice. We collaborated with an agile team to provide this experience report on their adoption of TDD, using observations and interviews within the product development environment. This article highlights a number of practices that underlie successful development with TDD. To provide a theoretical perspective that can help to explain how TDD supports a positive philosophy of software development, we have revised Northover et al.'s conceptual framework, which is based on a four stage model of agile development, to reinterpret Popper's theory of conjecture and falsification in the context of agile testing strategies. As a result of our findings, we propose an analytical model for TDD in agile software development which provides a theoretical basis for further investigations into the role of TDD and related practices.","Parsons, David; Lal, Ramesh; Lange, Manfred",2011.0,FUTURE INTERNET,10.3390/fi3040281,https://doi.org/10.3390/fi3040281
Identifying Guidelines for Test-Driven Development in Software Engineering-A Literature Review,"With the significance, ubiquity, and complexity of information technology continuously rising, the corresponding quality assurance becomes increasingly important and challenging. Consequently, numerous tools, techniques, paradigms, and strategies that facilitate the quality assurance of the developed applications have emerged. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of those strategies. In contrast to the traditional approach, it places testing ahead of the actual implementation, which, in turn, also heavily influences the system's design. With the approach being rather complex, naturally, guidance on its correct application is one of the most relevant aspects for many practitioners. To provide assistance to them, but also to researchers concerned with the domain, the publication at hand identifies twenty guidelines for the practical application of TDD in software engineering, by conducting a structured literature review. In doing so, it provides a solid foundation for the implementation of corresponding endeavors as well as a starting point for further discussion.","Staegemann, Daniel; Volk, Matthias; Pohl, Matthias; Haertel, Christian; Hintsch, Johannes; Turowski, Klaus",2023.0,"PROCEEDINGS OF SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, VOL 4",10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30
Test-Driven Development as a Reliable Embedded Software Engineering Practice,"Due to embedded co-design considerations, testing embedded software is typically deferred after the integration phase. Contrasting with the current embedded engineering practices, Test-Driven Development (TDD) promotes testing software during its development, even before the target hardware becomes available. Principally, TDD promotes a fast feedback cycle in which a test is written before the implementation. Moreover, each test is added to a test suite, which runs at every step in the TDD cycle. As a consequence, test-driven code is well tested and maintainable. Still, embedded software has some typical properties which impose challenges to apply the TDD cycle. Essentially, uploading software to target is generally too time-consuming to frequently run tests on target. Secondary issues are hardware dependencies and limited resources, such as memory footprint or processing power. In order to deal with these limitations, four methods have been identified and evaluated. Furthermore, a number of relevant design patterns are discussed to apply TDD in an embedded environment.","Cordemans, Piet; Van Landschoot, Sille; Boydens, Jeroen; Steegmans, Eric",2014.0,"EMBEDDED AND REAL TIME SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT: A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE: CONCEPTS, METHODS AND PRINCIPLES",10.1007/978-3-642-40888-5_4,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40888-5_4
Test Patterns for Cloud Applications,"Software systems are becoming graphical user intensive. They involve web technologies organized in the cloud platform which supports translation of services to a wider community. Such cloud applications are more vulnerable to misuse. Consequently, system development needs to focus on system security features in a comprehensive manner. Therefore, techniques that are based on test-driven development will be a good choice to use for the quality maintenance of such systems. We need checklists and mechanisms that provide identification and knowledge of best practices to maintain consistency in performing testing activities. We propose a test patterns-based technique which supports identification of test cases on the bases of specification and domain analysis of system under test. We provide a set of test patterns that support Test Driven Development (TDD) as well. We link misuse cases and security requirement to testing and provide test patterns for testing cloud applications.

Learning effective test driven development - Software development projects in an energy company,"The tests needed to prove, verify, and validate a software application are determined before the software application is developed. This is the essence of test driven development, an agile practice built upon sound software engineering principles. When applied effectively, this practice can have many benefits. The question becomes how to effectively adopt test driven development. This paper describes the experiences and lessons learned by two teams who adopted test driven development methodology for software systems developed at TransCanada. The overall success of test driven methodology is contingent upon the following key factors: experienced team champion, well-defined test scope, supportive database environment, repeatable software design pattern, and complementary manual testing. All of these factors and the appropriate test regime will lead to a better chance of success in a test driven development project.","Kum, Wing; Law, Amy",2006.0,"ICSOFT 2006: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Software and Data Technologies, Vol 1",,https://doi.org/
On Test Patterns for Cloud Applications,"Software testing is an important aspect for the quality of software.

We propose a test pattern based technique which supports identification of test cases on the basis of specification and domain analysis. The proposed technique provides support for Test Driven Development (TDD) and Test Last Development (TLD). We provide test patterns for testing cloud applications where we study what features an application would bear and we propose what test cases must exist in the test suite for that application.

How Specification by Example and Test-driven Development Help to Avoid Technial Debt,"This paper is an industrial experience report of applying the Specification by Example methodology and test-driven development to the development of a core component of a healthcare product. The methods are mapped to the four quadrants of technical debt introduced by Martin Fowler in order to show how they can help to avoid the accumulation of technical debt.

Presenter First: Organizing complex GUI applications for test-driven development,"Presenter First (PF) is a technique for organizing source code and development activities to produce fully tested GUI applications from customer stories using test-driven development. The three elements of Presenter First are a strategy for how applications are developed and tested, a variant on the Model View Presenter (MVP) design pattern, and a particular means of composing MVP triads. Presenter tests provide an economical alternative to automated GUI system tests. We have used Presenter First on projects ranging in size from several to a hundred MVP triads. This paper describes MVP creation, composition, scaling, and the tools and process we use. An example C# application illustrates the application of the Presenter First technique.","Alles, Micah; Crosby, David; Erickson, Carl; Harleton, Brian; Marsiglia, Michael; Pattison, Greg; Stienstra, Curt",2006.0,"AGILE 2006, Proceedings",10.1109/AGILE.2006.43,https://doi.org/10.1109/AGILE.2006.43
Towards Recognizing and Rewarding Efficient Developer Work Patterns,Software engineering researchers develop great techniques consisting of practices and tools that improve efficiency and quality of software development.

A Story-Telling Approach for a Software Engineering Course Design,"Advanced programming and software engineering techniques are challenging to learn due to their inherent complexity. However, to the average student they are even more challenging because they have never experienced the context in which the techniques are appropriate. For instance, why learn design patterns to increase maintainability when student exercises are never maintained? In this paper, we outline the contextual problems that software engineering teaching has to deal with and present a story telling approach for course design as a remedy. We outline the stories that over the last five years have structured lecturing and mandatory exercises for our advanced programming/software engineering course, and present benefits, liabilities, and experiences with the approach comparing it to the normal, topic structured, course design.","Christensen, Henrik Baerbak",2009.0,ITICSE 2009: PROCEEDING OF THE 2009 ACM SIGSE ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION,,https://doi.org/
TESEM: A Tool for Verifying Security Design Pattern Applications by Model Testing,"Because software developers are not necessarily security experts, identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities in the early stage of the development process (e.g., the requirement-or design-phase) is insufficient. Even if these issues are addressed at an early stage, it does not guarantee that the final software product actually satisfies security requirements. To realize secure designs, we propose extended security patterns, which include requirement-and design-level patterns as well as a new model testing process. Our approach is implemented in a tool called TESEM (Test Driven Secure Modeling Tool), which supports pattern applications by creating a script to execute model testing automatically. During an early development stage, the developer specifies threats and vulnerabilities in the target system, and then TESEM verifies whether the security patterns are properly applied and assesses whether these vulnerabilities are resolved.","Kobashi, Takanori; Yoshizawa, Masatoshi; Washizaki, Hironori; Fukazawa, Yoshiaki; Yoshioka, Nobukazu; Okubo, Takano; Kaiya, Haruhiko",2015.0,"2015 IEEE 8th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)",,https://doi.org/
A road map for implementing eXtreme Programming,"This paper proposes an implementation roadmap that shows how inexperienced software teams in industrial developing areas in China can adopt eXtreme Programming (XP) to produce software applications. Inexperienced teams unfamiliar with XP can face difficulties in adopting at once all twelve XP practices in a big bang implementation strategy. Intuitively, a step-by-step approach might seem more practical; however, XP practices are heavily intertwined and mutually dependent, creating problems in terms of prioritizing and justifying one instructional sequence over another. We propose a way to technically analyze the complex interrelationships between XP practices by identifying cluster patterns. These patterns can then be used to assist us in sequencing the introduction XP practices, helping both inexperienced teams and classroom learners in using XP.

Is designing software different from designing other things?,"This paper explores the question of whether designing software is different from designing other things (we believe it is). We discuss several key distinctions that are largely missing from the discourse on software design yet which are vital to the success of software designs. These distinctions are increasingly important as software becomes prevalent in the design tools and products of other engineering disciplines. By considering what is similar and what is different we help reveal how the lessons of software design may help other disciplines, and vice versa. This in turn illuminates a core meta-question of how educators in academia and industry can help evolve our understanding of what we do so that we can be more effective at software design. But first, we need to understand what is different, and what is not different, about this discipline called software design.","Socha, David; Walter, Skip",2006.0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,,https://doi.org/

Interference suppression in TDD/CDMA cellular systems with asymmetric traffic using MVDR beamforming,"The primary advantage of the TDD syetem is to accommodate asymmetric traffic by allocating different numbers of uplink and downlink time slots. However, in the TDD/CDMA cellular system, uplink signals may suffer strong interference from the downlink transmission of neighboring base stations. This kind of opposite direction interference has adverse impact on the TDD/CDMA system performance. In this paper, we propose to apply the MVDR beamforming technique to suppress the opposite direction interference. We evaluate the uplink performance of the proposed technique by simulation. Moreover, by jointly employing transmit beamforming in all asynchronous cells, the TDD/CDMA cellular system can allow different rates of asymmetry in different cells. Thus, each cell can design its own pattern of slot allocation.","Chen, CJ; Wang, LC",2002.0,"IEEE 56TH VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, VTC FALL 2002, VOLS 1-4, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
Performance Evaluation for the Co-existence of eMBB and URLLC Networks: Synchronized versus Unsynchronized TDD,"To ensure the high level of automation required in today's industrial applications, next-generation wireless networks must enable real-time control and automation of dynamic processes with the requirements of extreme low-latency and ultra-reliable communications. In this paper, we provide a performance assessment for the co-existence of a macro (eMBB) and a local factory (URLLC) network and evaluate the network conditions under which the latency and reliability requirements of factory automation applications are met. In particular, we evaluate the coexistence of the eMBB and URLLC networks under two scenarios: (i) synchronized TDD, in which both networks follow the same TDD pattern, and (ii) unsynchronized TDD, in which the eMBB and URLLC networks follow different TDD patterns. Simulation results show that the high downlink interference from the macro base stations towards the factory results in a reduction of the downlink URLLC capacity and service availability in case of synchronized TDD and a reduction of the uplink URLLC capacity and service availability in case of unsynchronized TDD. Finally, it is shown that a promising case for co-existence is the adjacent channel allocation, for both synchronized and unsynchronized TDD deployments. Here, the required isolation to protect the URLLC network in the worst-case scenario where the factory is located next to a macro site can be handled via the factory wall penetration loss (e.g., considering high concrete or metal-coated building walls) along with other solutions such as filters, larger separation distance, and band pairing.","Challita, Ursula; Hiltunen, Kimmo; Tercero, Miurel",2019.0,2019 IEEE 90TH VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (VTC2019-FALL),,https://doi.org/
Reaping the Benefits of Dynamic TDD in Massive MIMO,"Recent advances in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication show that equipping base stations (BSs) with large antenna arrays can significantly improve the performance of cellular networks. Massive MIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance the average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time-division duplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) subframe configurations, is a promising enhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic TDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic patterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference among cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique characteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a marriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the limitation of dynamic TDD in macrocell (MC) networks. Specifically, we advocate that the benefits of dynamic TDD can be fully extracted in MC networks equipped with massive MIMO, i.e., the BS-to-BS interference can be effectively removed by increasing the number of BS antennas. We provide detailed analysis using random matrix theory to show that the effect of the BS-to-BS interference on UL transmissions vanishes as the number of BS antennas per user grows infinitely large. Last but not least, we validate our analysis by numerical simulations.","Huang, Yan; Jalaian, Brian; Russell, Stephen; Samani, Hooman",2019.0,IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL,10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829350,https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829350
Opportunistic Interference Mitigation for D-TDD in Ultra-Dense Networks,"Dynamic time-division duplexing (D-TDD) is a promising solution to address the fast and varying traffic demands in ultra-dense networks (UDNs). However, in addition to conventional interference, the cross-link interference (CI) resulted by asymmetric uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission in D-TDD operation may further degrade system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic interference mitigation (OIM) framework to enhance D-TDD in UDNs by exploiting multi-user diversity in conjunction with interference-aware transmission. In particular, we first decompose the interference patterns experienced by D-TDD in a typical three-cell network, and propose novel interference alignment (IA) inspired opportunistic user scheduling and transmission schemes for each interference pattern. Our scheme mainly relies on the reference signal space (RSS) that guides the transmit beamforming and user scheduling to align the generated interference at a predefined subspace in each AP receiver with best effort. Numerical results show that our schemes can effectively mitigate the CI in D-TDD, and in conjunction with modified opportunistic IA for pure UL/DL transmission, our OIM framework achieves substantial performance again over the conventional schemes.","Xin, Qi; Gao, Hui; Lv, Tiejun",2018.0,2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS WORKSHOPS (ICC WORKSHOPS),,https://doi.org/
"Three-variate trajectories of metabolic control, body mass index, and insulin dose: Heterogeneous response to initiation of pump therapy in youth with type 1 diabetes","Objective Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in youths with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is often associated with lower HbA1c, lower total daily insulin dose (TDD), and lower body mass index (BMI) compared with multiple daily injections (MDI). Individual responses to CSII are diverse. The aim was to identify unique three-variate patterns of HbA1c, BMI standard deviation score (SDS), and TDD after switching to CSII. Methods Five thousand one hundred and thirty-three youths (<= 20 years; 48% boys; median age at pump start 12.5 years) with T1D duration >= 3 years at CSII initiation were selected from the multicenter DPV registry. We applied group-based multitrajectory modeling to identify groups of individuals following similar trajectories. Measurements were aggregated quarterly during a 3-year follow-up period. Trajectory variables were changes of HbA1c, BMI-SDS, and TDD from baseline (delta = quarterly aggregated values at each time point [i] minus the respective baseline value). Results Four groups of diverging Delta-HbA1c, Delta-BMI-SDS, and Delta-TDD patterns were identified. All showed improvements in HbA1c during the first 3 months. Group 1 (12%) was characterized by modest HbA1c increase thereafter, TDD reduction, and stable BMI-SDS. In Group 2 (39%), increasing HbA1c, decreasing BMI-SDS, and stable TDD were found. By contrast, sustainably improved HbA1c, increasing BMI-SDS, and stable TDD were observed in Group 3 (32%). Group 4 (17%) was characterized by increasing levels for HbA1c, BMI-SDS, and TDD. Between-group differences in baseline HbA1c, BMI-SDS, TDD as well as in sex ratio, age at diabetes onset and at pump start were observed. Conclusions Definite trajectories of glycemic control, BMI, and TDD over 3 years after CSII initiation were identified in youths with T1D allowing a more personalized treatment recommendation.","Tauschmann, Martin; Schwandt, Anke; Prinz, Nicole; Becker, Marianne; Biester, Torben; Hess, Melanie; Holder, Martin; Karges, Beate; Naeke, Andrea; Kuss, Oliver; von Sengbusch, Simone; Holl, Reinhard W.",2022.0,PEDIATRIC DIABETES,10.1111/pedi.13320,https://doi.org/10.1111/pedi.13320
Interference analysis and resource allocation for TDD-CDMA systems to support asymmetric services by using directional antennas,"This paper explores the advantages of using directional antennas in time division duplex (TDD) code division multiple access (CDMA) systems to support asymmetric traffic services. In the TDD-CDMA system, the transmission for asymmetric traffic from neighboring cells may cause the cross-slot interference, which can seriously degrade system capacity. To avoid the cross-slot interference for TDD-CDMA systems, many current resource allocation algorithms typically require a global control on the transmission direction (either downlink or uplink) in each time slot. Apparently, this requirement substantially constrains the flexibility of TDD-CDMA systems to deliver asymmetric traffic services in a more practical situation where every cell may have different uplink and downlink bandwidth requirements. We analyze the interference of the TDD-CDMA system with a trisector cellular architecture, where three directional antennas are employed at each base station. We find that the directivity of directional antennas can provide an additional degree of freedom for allocating radio resource. Taking advantage of this property, we introduce the concept of virtual cell, defined as the same converge area of a cell but is composed of three sectors from the three adjacent base stations. Furthermore, we propose a new virtual cell-based distributed code/time slot allocation algorithm to enable a TDD-CDMA system to provide asymmetric services with different rates of asymmetry in every cell coverage area. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm does not only offer more flexibility in handling nonuniform traffic patterns, but maintain good radio link performance and call blocking performance.","Wang, LC; Huang, SY; Tseng, YC",2005.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY,10.1109/TVT.2005.844660,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2005.844660
DAYLIGHT COEFFICIENT COMPUTATION METHOD FOR THE EFFICIENCY OF TUBULAR DAYLIGHT DEVICE,"Tubular daylight device (TDD) is a simple structure that allows the transmission of daylight from outside to inside a room. Over the last decade the development of materials with high specular reflectance has made the TDD increasingly efficient, but it is important to quantify this effectiveness by producing reliable predictive methods. There has been research effort on developing a method to predict performance of TDD. One of the challenges of evaluating the TDD performance is that surrounding sky conditions constantly change following complex diurnal and seasonal patterns, which has not been completely solved by these researches. In this paper, a mathematic model is developed for time series of efficiency of TDD using daylight coefficient methods, and the comparison between computation results with this model and simulation result of TracePro demonstrate the validity of this model.","Wang, S.

Semi-Static Radio Frame Configuration for URLLC Deployments in 5G Macro TDD Networks,"Dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) is one of the major novelties of the 5G new radio standard. It notably improves the network resource utilization with sporadic directional packet arrivals. Although, the feasibility of the ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) within such deployments is critically challenged, mainly due to the crosslink interference (CLI). In this work, we propose a semistatic and computationally-efficient TDD radio frame adaptation algorithm for 5G macro deployments. Particularly, we first identify the quasi-static variance of the cross-cell traffic buffering performance, with various CLI co-existence conditions. Accordingly, a common radio frame pattern is dynamically estimated based on the filtered multi-cell traffic statistics. Our system-level simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves a highly improved URLLC outage performance, i.e., offering similar to 40% reduction gain of the achievable URLLC outage latency compared to perfect static-TDD, and approaching the optimal interference-free flexible-TDD case; though, with a significantly lower control overhead size.","Esswie, Ali A.; Pedersen, Klaus, I; Mogensen, Preben E.",2020.0,2020 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (WCNC),,https://doi.org/
Towards creating a GPGPU-accelerated framework for pattern matching,"Model-driven engineering (MDE) is a popular software development methodology in the software industry. Finding a predefined pattern in a domain-specific model can be requested in MDE. This technique can help in optimizing or refactoring the models or to translate from one language to another one. The goal of the current researching is to create a framework for MDE which can find patterns defined by the users. Performance is a key issue. Using heterogeneous computation system (e.g.: CPU+GPU) is a promising way to increase the performance of the calculation. Therefore, we created a solution based on the OpenCL framework which is one of the most popular heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, the new pattern matching framework and the main steps of its creation are presented. The applied conception consists of two main steps. Firstly, a simpler case study is solved and experiences are collected from the occurring challenges. Secondly, the achieved solution was extended for general pattern matching. In both steps, the core algorithms are implemented according to the test-driven development methodology. To elaborate these steps, a new technique is provided which can be useful in creating any GPU-based model transformation and thus MDE approaches are improved in general.","Fekete, Tamas; Mezei, Gergely",2015.0,IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND INFORMATICS (SISY),,https://doi.org/

Each proposed scheme can be applied to the measurement procedure for the possible handover scenarios to GSM and 1.28 Mcps TDD mode using different frequency band from original 1.28 Mcps TDD mode, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed structures attain the longer measurement time for target system to enhance the reliability of measurement or increase the probability of successful synchronization for handover.

A Graph Coloring based Inter-Slice Resource Management for 5G Dynamic TDD RANs,"This paper studies the notion of network slicing in the emerging 5G Time Division Duplex (TDD) networks, considering different applications with diverse service requirements. The proposed solution relies on flexible slicing considering the entire spectrum band, wherein service oriented slices can independently adopt and adjust an UL/DL ratio reflecting traffic conditions. To this end, this paper initially describes and analyses the inter-slice resource allocation problem taking into account different TDD patterns, the slice traffic load and the inter-node interference, which originates by multiple and diverse sources. In this context, a graph-based framework is proposed to reduce the complexity of the problem by decoupling it in two sub-problems: the selection of TDD patterns to find which links should be activated at particular time instances and accordingly perform graph-based resource allocation for all slice traffic collectively. Our performance evaluations show significant enhancements of the UL and DL throughput respectively.","Pateromichelakis, Emmanouil; Samdanis, Konstantinos",2018.0,2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC),,https://doi.org/
CDMA TDD system for wireless multimedia services with traffic unbalance between uplink and downlink,"This paper proposes a code dimension multiple access (CDMA) time division duplex (TDD) system for wireless multimedia services with traffic unbalance between uplink and downlink. In the proposed system, the number of uplink time slots in a TDD frame differs from that of downlink. Moreover, the difference can be reset by the network operator according to the traffic pattern. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system under multimedia environment using Markov analysis and computer simulation. The results show that the frequency utilization is maximized even when the uplink and downlink traffic volumes are unbalanced. This, in turn, reduces drastically the blocking rate of multimedia calls (connections) in the proposed system compared with that in the traditional CDMA systems where the uplink and downlink use equal bandwidth.","Jeong, DG; Jeon, WS",1999.0,IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS,,https://doi.org/
A novel interference-resolving algorithm to support asymmetric services in TDD-CDMA systems with directional antennas,"This paper presents a new cross-slot interference-resolving algorithm for supporting unbalance traffic between downlink and uplink in TDD-CDMA systems. To avoid cross-slot interference between downlink and uplink, traditional algorithms typically require a global control on the transmission direction in each time slot among all cells. Obviously, this requirement significantly limits one of the key advantages in the TDD system -- enabling different rate asymmetry. We observe that the tri-sector cellular architecture possesses additional orthogonality inherently due to the directivity of directional antenna, which can provide an additional degree of freedom in allocating radio resource (i.e., time slots). Thus we propose a new distributed slot allocation algorithm based on the tri-sector cellular architecture. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is to enable a TDD-CDMA system to provide asymmetric services with different rates of asymmetry in all cells, thereby having more flexibility in handling uniform traffic patterns.","Wang, LC; Huang, SY; Tseng, YC",2002.0,"IEEE 55TH VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, VTC SPRING 2002, VOLS 1-4, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
Low threading dislocation Ge on Si by combining deposition and etching,"Blanket and selective Ge growth on Si is investigated using reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition. To reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) at low thickness, Ge deposition with cyclic annealing followed by HCl etching is performed. In the case of blanket Ge deposition, a TDD of 1.3x10(6) cm(-2) is obtained, when the Ge layer is etched back from 4.5 mu m thickness to 1.8 mu m. The TDD is not increased relative to the situation before etching. The root mean square of roughness of the 1.8 mu m thick Ge is about 0.46 nm, which is of the same level as before HCl etching. Further etching shows increased surface roughness caused by non-uniform strain distribution near the interface due to misfit dislocations and threading dislocations. The TDD also becomes higher because the etchfront of Ge reaches areas with high dislocation density near the interface. In the case of selective Ge growth, a slightly lower TDD is observed in smaller windows caused by a weak pattern size dependence on Ge thickness. A significant decrease of TDD of selectively grown Ge is also observed by increasing the Ge thickness. An about 10 times lower TDD at the same Ge thickness is demonstrated by applying a combination of deposition and etching processes during selective Ge growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Investigation of uplink performances based on the switched beam antenna schenite in TDD-CDMA systems,"In this paper, the switched beam antenna array is analyzed and its model in the system level is presented firstly. Based on the combination of multi-user detection (MUD) and the switched beam antenna (SBA) techniques in the time division duplexing-code division multiplex access (TDD-CDMA) system, the uplink load is investigated and the corresponding advanced uplink admission control scheme based on SBA is proposed. The uplink load is impacted by many elements, such as MUD factor, antenna beam pattern and the number of main beams, and so on. The antenna beam partner and the number of main beam make more important influences than the MUD factor in the uplink performances.

Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) consisting of low-power small cells underlying the existing macro cells represent the preferred solution to increase the capacity of cellular systems by means of spatial spectrum reuse. Static uplink/downlink time-division duplexing (TDD) configurations of existing networks cannot satisfy the varying traffic patterns of large number of small cells, which vary among cells and over time. In this paper we propose and evaluate a centralized algorithm for dynamic TDD frame configuration to which operates on a cluster-based cellular network, maximize the network throughput and preserving fairness. Our algorithm is characterized by only O (nlogn) time complexity (with n cells in the network), which allows for instantaneous network-wise reconfigurations minimizing overhead. The algorithm is proven to be optimal and time efficient. Extensive simulation results using realistic application traffic have shown the superiority the proposed solution against static TDD configurations of LTE systems. Throughput improvements up to 43 % as well as reductions in queued traffic at cells up to 52 % are obtained using separate utility functions designed for throughput maximization and fairness respectively.","Nguyen, Khanh; Zappaterra, Luca; Choi, Hyeong-Ah",2015.0,2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION WORKSHOP (ICCW),,https://doi.org/
Automatic calibration method using transmitting signals of an adaptive array for TDD systems,"Adaptive arrays are especially effective in reducing cochannel interference and increasing channel capacity in time-division duplex (TDD) mobile communication systems because, ideally, the optimum pattern formed in the receiving mode can be applied to the transmitting pattern. However, since the radiation pattern of the adaptive array is generally formed on a baseband, the amplitude and phase errors must be calibrated between the branches of the array due to individual differences in the radio frequency (RF) devices of the receivers and transmitters. Moreover, since these errors change over time due to temperature variations, real-time calibration is required. This correspondence proposes an Automatic Calibration method using Transmitting signals (ACT) for adaptive base station antennas that is suitable for TDD communication systems, i.e., it enables real-time calibration. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration method is demonstrated using an experimental adaptive array testbed.","Nishimori, K; Cho, K; Takatori, Y; Hori, T",2001.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY,10.1109/25.966592,https://doi.org/10.1109/25.966592
Inherent correlation between dose and clearance in therapeutic drug monitoring settings: Possible misinterpretation in population pharmacokinetic analyses,"During the course of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), doses are adjusted to attain a target concentration range and a correlation between clearance (CL) and dose is introduced. In population pharmacokinetic analyses of such TDM data, CL has frequently been modeled as a function of dose. This paper demonstrates by simulation methodology that the TDM process does indeed introduce a correlation between dose and CL which can be interpreted as a nonlinearity. Using literature values of carbamazepine pharmacokinetics, three steady-state concentrations were simulated following a standard 1000 mg total daily dose (TDD) regimen in 100 in silico subjects. A set of clinical rules was established to adjust the TDD based on these three concentrations, as might be done in the clinical setting. Another set of concentrations using these TDM-derived TDDs for each subject (600-1600 mg) was simulated. A standard population pharmacokinetic analysis of the post-TDM data was conducted using NONMEM. This process was replicated 100 times to estimate the type II error rate. When CL was modeled without TDD, plots of WRES versus PRED demonstrated a clear pattern, as did the delta plots of CL (CL minus TVCL) versus TDD, suggesting the covariate TDD should be incorporated into the model. After TDD was included in the model for CL, the objective function value decreased by an average of 75.7 (p < 0.001). In addition, the inter-individual variability in CL expressed as a coefficient of variation decreased by an average of 9.9% and the diagnostic plots improved. Although CL was simulated to be independent of TDD, it was identified as an important covariate using standard approaches in a simulated TDM setting in 100% of the replicated simulation studies. The TDM process introduces a correlation between CL and TDD that can be misinterpreted as nonlinearity in the system","Ahn, JE; Birnbaum, AK; Brundage, RC",2005.0,JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS,10.1007/s10928-005-0083-6,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10928-005-0083-6
Insulin Requirement Profiles of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes After Achieving Stabilized Glycemic Control with Short-Term Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion,"Background: As in type 1 diabetes, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy is emerging as a promising therapeutic option in type 2 diabetes. However, the insulin requirement profiles of patients with type 2 diabetes when treated via CSII with rapid-acting insulin analogs have not been well investigated. Methods: We examined insulin requirement profiles of type 2 diabetes patients (n = 300; age, 57.9 +/- 11.4 years; hemoglobin A1c [HbA(1c)], 9.1 +/- 2.2%) for 3 days after achieving normoglycemia via 1-2 weeks of CSII therapy. We also analyzed the total daily dose (TDD) of insulin-associated clinical and laboratory parameters at baseline. Results: The mean TDD was 45.1 +/- 24.7 IU/day (range, 4.8-145.8 IU/day). The total daily bolus (TBo) (range 2.8-111.3 IU/day) was 64.1 +/- 12.1% of the TDD. The rates of infusion for day and night in total daily basal dose (TBa) were 0.74 +/- 0.35 and 0.41 +/- 0.32 IU/h, respectively. The dose ratio (in IU/day) was 2.7 : 1.9 : 1.6 : 1.8 : 1 (breakfast, lunch, and dinner bolus and day and night basal, respectively). After adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index, TDD was associated with HbA(1c), fasting and 2-h postprandial plasma glucose, fasting C-peptide, and carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Initial TDD in type 2 diabetes patients on CSII showed a wide range of distribution with a TBo-to-TBa ratio >2.0 and was associated with parameters indicating glycemic control but not with body weight, suggesting that the currently used protocol in dose determination of insulin, including allocation of half of the TDD to TBa or weight-based determination of initial TDD, may need to be reexamined when treating type 2 diabetes with CSII therapy.","Noh, Yun-Hee; Lee, Won-Jin; Kim, Kyoung-Ah; Lim, Inja; Lee, Jun-Ho; Lee, Ju-Han; Kim, Seonguk; Choi, Soo-Bong",2010.0,DIABETES TECHNOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS,10.1089/dia.2009.0131,https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2009.0131

Based on the power limit the results show the voice and data blocking probabilities under different cell coverage radius, classes of calls and arrival rates.

Adaptive resource allocations for D-TDD systems in wireless cellular networks,"In this paper, we propose adaptive resource allocation algorithms for dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) systems in wireless cellular networks. Recently, D-TDD has gained much attention as an efficient duplex scheme for high-speed data communications, because adaptive switching ability enables a system to obtain statistical multiplexing gain by exploiting dynamic and asymmetric data traffic. However, it has been noted that strong co-channel interference can be present due to adaptive switching in a cellular network that uses frequency reuse. To suppress the effect of strong co-channel interference and obtain the benefit of D-TDD, we employ time slot allocation (TSA) strategy along with sector antenna layouts. In addition to bandwidths adaptation to the dynamic and asymmetric traffic pattern, we also change the transmission mode based on the channel state of each link. For each time slot, the modulation level can be adaptively selected from multilevel transmission modes, satisfying the required packet error rate (PER) performance. Hence, the algorithm not only suppresses co-channel interference by co-operative time slot allocation, but also adopts multi-level transmission modes, with different modulation formats and coding for each time slot, so that maximum spectral efficiency can be achieved. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of these systems.","Yun, JN; Kavehrad, M",2004.0,"MILCOM 2004 - 2004 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1- 3",,https://doi.org/
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Fully Decentralized Dynamic Time Division Configuration for 5G and B5G Network,"Future network services must adapt to the highly dynamic uplink and downlink traffic. To fulfill this requirement, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) proposed dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) technology in Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release 11. Afterward, the 3GPP RAN#86 meeting clarified that 5G NR needs to support dynamic adjustment of the duplex pattern (transmission direction) in the time domain. Although 5G NR provides a more flexible duplex pattern, how to configure an effective duplex pattern according to services traffic is still an open research area. In this research, we propose a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based decentralized D-TDD configuration method. First, we model a D-TDD configuration problem as a dynamic programming problem. Given the buffer length of all UE, we model the D-TDD configuration policy as a conditional probability distribution. Our goal is to find a D-TDD configuration policy that maximizes the expected discount return of all UE's sum rates. Second, in order to reduce signaling overhead, we design a fully decentralized solution with distributed MARL technology. Each agent in MARL makes decisions only based on local observations. We regard each base station (BS) as an agent, and each agent configures uplink and downlink time slot ratio according to length of intra-BS user (UE) queue buffer. Third, in order to solve the problem of overall system revenue caused by the lack of global information in MARL, we apply leniency control and binary LSTM (BLSTM) based auto-encoder. Leniency controller effectively controls Q-value estimation process in MARL according to Q-value and current network conditions, and auto-encoder makes up for the defect that leniency control cannot handle complex environments and high-dimensional data. Through the parallel distributed training, the global D-TDD policy is obtained. This method deploys the MARL algorithm on the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server of each BS and uses the storage and computing capabilities of the server for distributed training. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed MARL converges stably in various environments, and performs better than distributed deep reinforcement algorithm.","Chen, Xiangyu; Chuai, Gang; Gao, Weidong",2022.0,SENSORS,10.3390/s22051746,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051746

CDMA/TDD system for mobile multimedia communications,"This paper proposes a CDMA/TDD system for wireless multimedia services with traffic unbalance between uplink and downlink. In the proposed system, the number of uplink time slots in a TDD frame differs from that of downlink. Moreover, the difference can be reset by the network operator according to the traffic pattern. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system under multimedia environments. The results show that the frequency utilization is maximized even when the uplink and downlink traffic volumes are unbalanced. This, in turn, reduces drastically the blocking rate of multimedia calls (connections) in the proposed system compared with that in the traditional CDMA systems where the uplink and downlink use equal bandwidth.","Jeong, DG; Jeon, WS",1998.0,ICC 98 - 1998 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS VOLS 1-3,,https://doi.org/
Insulin requirement profiles and related factors of insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes,"Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is an effective therapy to control hyperglycemia in both patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, there is little data investigating the insulin dose setting during CSII therapy in type 2 diabetes to achieve optimal glycemic control and avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, this study is aimed to assess the dose characteristics of insulin requirement and explore the related clinical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated with CSII. A total of 327 patients (195 males) aged 52.9 +/- 12.5 years old were included in this study. Patients were treated with CSII to achieve the target fasting capillary blood glucose (4.4-7.0 mmol L-1) and 2-h postprandial capillary blood glucose (4.4-10.0 mmol L-1) by adjusting insulin infusion according to the seven-point capillary blood glucose profiles. Total daily insulin dose (TDD), total daily insulin dose per kilogram (TDD kg(-1)) and the ratio of total basal insulin dose (TBD) to TDD (%TBa) were calculated after patients achieved the glucose targets for at least 3 days via 1-2 weeks of CSII treatment. And insulin dose, insulin dosing patterns and the relevant clinical factors were analyzed. The mean ratio of basal/bolus insulin distribution of all patients was 40%:60%. Patients with central obesity needed more TDD (51.3 +/- 17.1 U versus 43.5 +/- 14.0 U, P<0.05) and TDD kg(-1) (0.8 +/- 0.3 U kg(-1) versus 0.7 +/- 0.2 U kg(-1), P<0.05) than those without central obesity. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated that TDD was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting C-peptide level, 2 h-postprandial C-peptide level and time to achieve glycemic target (all P<0.05); TDD kg(-1) was positively correlated with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), baseline FPG, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting C-peptide level and time to achieve glycemic target, and negatively correlated with BMI (all P<0.05). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that BMI (beta=1.796, P<0.01), WC (beta=0.709, P<0.01), baseline FPG (beta=1.459, P<0.01) and HbA1c (beta=0.930, P=0.021) were independently related to TDD. Gender (beta=-0.107, P=0.003), WC (beta=0.005, P=0.029), baseline FPG (beta=0.025, P<0.01) and HbA1c (beta=0.016, P=0.007) were independently associated with TDD kg(-1). Gender (beta=-0.015, P=0.048) and disease duration (beta=0.134, P=0.029) were independently associated with %TBa. %TBa is around 40% in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with CSII when glycemic control is achieved. In addition to body weight or BMI, WC and glucose levels before CSII should be considered to set TDD. Patients with central obesity or poor glycemic control might need more TDD. Higher %TBa should be considered in female patients or patients with longer disease duration.","Yang, Xubin; Deng, Hongrong; Zhang, Xiuzhen; Yang, Daizhi; Yan, Jinhua; Yao, Bin; Weng, Jianping; Xu, Wen",2019.0,SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES,10.1007/s11427-018-9530-3,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-018-9530-3

Dynamic-TDD and optimum slot-allocation in fixed cellular systems,"Dynamic TDD (D-TDD) has gained attention as a means to deliver high dense two-way traffic. However, the outage performance of D-TDD system is severely limited by the strong interference from co-channel cells in a downlink cycle, while the reference cell is in its uplink duty cycle. To suppress the co-channel interference during uplink reception, we consider two kinds of time slot allocation strategies, combined with sector antennas: MaxMin {SIR} and Max {SIR}. MaxMin {SIR} is an optimum time slot allocation strategy, in the sense that it maximizes the minimum signal to interference ratio expectation value over extra uplink time slot region. It is used as a performance benchmark in our analysis. Meanwhile, Max {SIR} is a simple and efficient algorithm to improve outage performance. It is established that the performance difference between the two algorithms is not noticeable, especially when the dynamic range of traffic pattern between the uplink and downlink is small. Also, outage performance comparison between Max {SIR} algorithm and adaptive array antennas is provided. The proposed system shows promise and offers a compromise between system complexity and the desired availability.","Jeong, W; Kavehrad, M",2001.0,"IEEE 54TH VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, VTC FALL 2001, VOLS 1-4, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
A novel configuration for realizing automatic calibration of adaptive array using dispersed SPDT switches for TDD systems,This paper proposes a hardware configuration using only single pole dual throw (SPDT) switches to realize the previously proposed automatic calibration method using transmitting Signals (ACT) for the adaptive array in TDD communication systems. The proposed configuration obtains the same calibration values as the conventional ACT does while reducing the number of switch branches. The transmission pattern using the proposed calibration method is also presented based on an experimental adaptive array testbed in an actual microcell environment. The experimental results show that the ideal radiation pattern formation is achieved by employing the proposed calibration method in an environment with a moving terminal station and where arriving co-channel interference exists.,"Nishimori, K; Cho, K; Takatori, Y; Hori, T",2001.0,IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS,,https://doi.org/
Designs of precoding for LTE TDD using cell specific reference signals,"We design non-codebook-based Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) precoding schemes using multiple cell-specific reference signals patterns for the time division duplex (TDD) mode of LTE, where channel reciprocity can be exploited. Previously proposed non-codebook-based precoding schemes typically use UE specific reference signals for demodulation. Cell specific reference signals are however always allocated for the transmission of common control signalling, mobility measurements and downlink channel quality measurements. In order to save the resources occupied by UE specific reference signals, and to simplify UE implementation, a precoder-estimation scheme and a codebook-assisted scheme are designed. The codebook-assisted scheme has the novelty of using a codebook in equalization. Link throughput simulations indicate that the codebook-assisted scheme is preferable compared to the precoder-estimation scheme and the scheme using UE specific reference signals in scenarios with moderate UE velocity.","Sun, Fan; Lu, Lu; Sorensen, Troels B.",2010.0,2010 IEEE GLOBECOM WORKSHOPS,10.1109/GLOCOMW.2010.5700449,https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2010.5700449
An adaptive time slot allocation strategy for W-CDMA/TDD system,"The code division multiple access system with time division duplex mode (CDMA/TDD) where the same frequency allocation is made for both uplink and downlink is a good solution when the traffic asymmetry between uplink and downlink exists. However when the asymmetry of each cell may be significantly different from each other, the traffic may experience severe interference from each other when each cell's own slot allocation is made according to the level of traffic asymmetry in each cell. The interference in the W-CDMA/TDD system when the slot allocations are made according to traffic patterns of each cell is analyzed, and a time slot allocation scheme considering the traffic asymmetry is proposed. In this paper system performances are simulated under the proposed time slot allocation strategy and its optimal operation of the strategy is investigated.","Lee, J; Han, YN; Kwon, D",2001.0,"IEEE VTC 53RD VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, SPRING 2001, VOLS 1-4, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
Reduced threading dislocation density in a germanium epitaxial film coalesced on an arrayed silicon-on-insulator strip,"This paper reports a reduction in the threading dislocation density (TDD) of a Ge epitaxial film on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) wafer in terms of the Si-photonics device application. An array of submicron SOI strips is prepared as a patterned substrate, on which Ge is epitaxially grown by chemical vapor deposition. A continuous Ge film is formed by a coalescence of the adjacent Ge crystals on the arrayed SOI strip, while leaving semicylindrical voids on the exposed surface of the buried SiO2 (BOX) layer between the strips. The TDD of the coalesced Ge film is reduced to 1.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(8 )cm(-2), which is approximately a half of 2.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(8 )cm(-2) for a Ge film on an unpatterned SOI. A transmission electron microscope observation reveals that the TDD reduction is derived from a downward bending of the dislocation toward the void. An accumulation of the dislocations at the strip sidewalls also contributes to the TDD reduction.","Bin Amin, Mohd Faiz; Motomura, Kazuki; Hizawa, Takeshi; Piedra-Lorenzana, Jose A.; Nakai, Tetsuya; Ishikawa, Yasuhiko",2022.0,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS,10.35848/1347-4065/ac8630,https://doi.org/10.35848/1347-4065/ac8630
Impediments for Automated Testing - An Empirical Analysis of a User Support Discussion Board,"To better understand the challenges encountered by users and developers of automatic software testing, we have performed an empirical investigation of a discussion board used for support of a test automation framework having several hundred users. The messages on the discussion board were stratified into problem reports, help requests, development information, and feature requests. The messages in the problem report and help request strata were then sampled and analyzed using thematic analysis, searching for common patterns. Our analysis indicate that a large part of the impediments discussed on the board are related to issues related to the centralized IT environment, and to erroneous behavior connected to the use of the framework and related components. We also observed a large amount of impediments related to the use of software development tools. Turning to the help requests, we found that the majority of the help requests were about designing test scripts and not about the areas that appear to be most problematic. From our results and previous publications, we see a clear need to simplify the use, installation, and configuration of test systems of this type. The problems attributable to software development tools suggest that testers implementing test automation need more skills in handling those tools, than historically has been assumed. Finally, we propose that further research into the benefits of centralization of tools and IT environments, as well as structured deployment and efficient use of test automation, is performed.","Wiklund, Kristian; Sundmark, Daniel; Eldh, Sigrid; Lundqvist, Kristina",2014.0,"2014 IEEE SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE TESTING, VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION (ICST)",10.1109/ICST.2014.24,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICST.2014.24
Online Radio Pattern Optimization Based on Dual Reinforcement-Learning Approach for 5G URLLC Networks,"The fifth generation (5G) radio access technology is designed to support highly delay-sensitive applications, i.e., ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). For dynamic time division duplex (TDD) systems, the real-time optimization of the radio pattern selection becomes of a vital significance in achieving decent URLLC outage latency. In this study, a dual reinforcement machine learning (RML) approach is developed for online pattern optimization in 5G new radio TDD deployments. The proposed solution seeks to minimizing the maximum URLLC tail latency, i.e., min-max problem, by introducing nested RML instances. The directional and real-time traffic statistics are monitored and given to the primary RML layer to estimate the sufficient number of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) symbols across the upcoming radio pattern. The secondary RML sub-networks determine the DL and UL symbol structure which best minimizes the URLLC outage latency. The proposed solution is evaluated by extensive and highly-detailed system level simulations, where our results demonstrate a considerable URLLC outage latency improvement with the proposed scheme, compared to the state-of-the-art dynamic-TDD proposals.","Esswie, Ali A.; Pedersen, Klaus I.; Mogensen, Preben E.",2020.0,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011026,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011026

In this paper, we propose an adaptive hopping pattern control system which is able to avoid the multiple access interference of hit. The proposed system decreases the influence of hit and increases the user capacity in the cell. And this adaptive hopping pattern control is applied to both single-cell and multi-cell systems. By computer simulation to evaluate the performance of this system, we found that this system is effective in increasing the multiple access capability.","Akabane, K; Nakagawa, M",1996.0,IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS,,https://doi.org/
Cardiac crises: Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy during TANG02 deficiency related metabolic crises,"BACKGROUND TANG02 deficiency disorder (TDD) is an autosomal recessive disease associated with metabolic crisis, lethal cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy. Data regarding treatment, management, and outcomes of cardiac manifestations of TDD are lacking. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe TDD-related cardiac crises. METHODS Retrospective multicenter chart review was made of TDD patients admitted with cardiac crises, defined as development of ventricular tachycardia (VT), cardiomyopathy, or cardiac arrest during metabolic crises. RESULTS Twenty-seven children were admitted for 43 cardiac crises (median age 6.4 years; interquartile range [IQR] 2.4-9.8 years) at 14 centers. During crisis, QTc prolongation occurred in all (median 547 ms; IQR 504-600 ms) and a type I Brugada pattern in 8 (26%). Arrhythmias included VT in 21 (78%), supraventricular tachycardia in 3 (11%), and heart block in 1 (4%). Nineteen patients (70%) developed cardiomyopathy, and 20 (74%) experienced a cardiac arrest. There were 10 deaths (37%), 6 related to arrhythmias. In 5 patients, recalcitrant VT occurred despite use of antiarrhythmic drugs. In 6 patients, arrhythmias were controlled after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support; 5 of these patients survived. Among 10 patients who survived VT without ECMO, successful treatment included intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, and atrial pacing in multiple cases and verapamil in 1 patient. Initiation of feeds seemed to decrease VT events. CONCLUSION TDD-related cardiac crises are associated with a high risk of arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and death. Although further studies are needed, early recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Acutely, intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, atrial pacing, and ECMO as a last resort seem to be the best current treatment options, and early initiation of feeds may prevent VT events.","Miyake, Christina Y.; Lay, Erica J.; Beach, Cheyenne M.; Ceresnak, Scott R.; Delauz, Caridad M.; Howard, Taylor S.; Janson, Christopher M.; Jardine, Kate; Kannankeril, Prince J.; Kava, Maina; Kim, Jeffrey J.; Liberman, Leonardo; Macicek, Scott L.; Pham, Tam Dam; Robertson, Terry; Valdes, Santiago O.; Webster, Gregory; Stephens, Sara B.; Milewicz, Diana M.; Azamian, Mahshid; Ehsan, Saad A.; Houck, Kimberly M.; Soler-Alfonso, Claudia; Glinton, Kevin E.; Tosur, Mustafa; Li, Na; Xu, Weiyi; Lalani, Seema R.; Zhang, Lilei",2022.0,HEART RHYTHM,10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.05.009,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.05.009
Associations between home insulin dose adjustments and glycemic outcomes at hospital admission,"Aims: To describe patterns of home insulin dose adjustments for non-surgical, noncritically ill patients at admission and to describe associations between these adjustments and inpatient glycemic control. Methods: Hospital records of non-critically ill patients treated with basal insulin prior to admission were identified. After exclusion of records in which a confounding factor influencing insulin dosing was present, 258 patient-admissions over a 3-year time period were included. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association between adjustments to home insulin total daily dose (TDD) and inpatient glycemic control within the first 48 h, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results: On hospital days 1 (HD1) and 2 (HD2), the home insulin TDD was reduced by 43.5% and 23.9%, respectively. Reductions in the home TDD ranging from 10% to 50% were not associated with normoglycemia or hyperglycemia, whereas increases ranging from 10% to 50% were associated with 2-5-fold increased odds of hyperglycemia. For patients with home insulin TDD >= 0.4 units/kg/day, a weight-based dose of 0.4-0.6 units/kg/day was associated with significantly higher odds of normoglycemia on HD2 (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.42-11.21) compared to lower doses. Conclusions: Compared to less aggressive increases, home insulin dose increases ranging from 10% to 50% were associated with greater odds of hyperglycemia without increased odds of hypoglycemia during early hospitalization.

Interference Mitigation and Traffic Adaptation Using Cell Clustering For LTE-TDD Systems,"Dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) mode has been suggested to be used in LTE systems for small-sized cells with asymmetric traffic. Despite its flexibility, the TDD mode suffers from sophisticated interference patterns, i.e. mobile-tomobile and Base station-to-Base Station interference. In order to solve this problem, the 3GPP has specified a set of methods for interference mitigation and traffic adaptation (IMTA). Cell clustering is one of these methods, where cells are organized in clusters. Inside each cluster, cells shall have the same frame configuration. The cells are assigned to clusters using specified rules that have to take into account interference levels and traffic asymmetry. In this paper, we propose methods for cell clustering in the context of IMTA. Simulation results have shown that the proposed methods outperform existing methods, especially in uplink.","Nasreddine, Jad; Hassan, Samer El Hajj",2016.0,2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY (IMCET),,https://doi.org/
Realization of low dislocation density AlN on a small-coalescence-area nano-patterned sapphire substrate,"Growth behaviors of AlN on hexagonal configuration hole-type and truncated-cone-pillar-type nanopatterned sapphire substrates (NPSSs) have been investigated. It is found that threading dislocation density (TDD) of AlN grown on the hole-type NPSS reaches 4.87 x 108 cm -2, which is over one order of magnitude lower than the value 6.63 x 109 cm -2 on the pillar-type one with the same period and mesa width. It is verified that the TDD of AlN grown on NPSSs is greatly dominated by the area ratio of the coalescence zones and thus the NPSS pattern with a small coalescence area (SCA) ratio is the preferred choice for highquality AlN epitaxy. Benefiting from the low-TDD AlN grown on the hole-type NPSS with an SCA, the internal quantum efficiency of the 281 nm AlGaN-based multiple quantum wells has reached 73.9% at 300 K.","Xu, F.

MAC scheduling policies with reduced power consumption and bounded packet delays for centrally controlled TDD wireless networks,"In networks with mobile nodes, power consumption is an important constraint due to the limited battery power available at the mobile nodes. Reduction of power consumption in mobile devices can be achieved by keeping these devices In a low power (standby) mode during periods of inactivity. This may, however, result in increased end-to-end delays leading to violation of the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. In this paper, we propose a Medium Access Control (MAC) scheduling policies for centrally controlled TDD wireless systems. The proposed policies reduce the power consumption of mobile devices by putting them into low power mode intelligently, using probabilistic estimates of inactivity based on the previous traffic arrival pattern. The policies ensure that the QoS parameters such as end-to-end packet delays are not violated.","Chakraborty, I; Kashyap, A; Kumar, A; Rastogi, A; Saran, H; Shorey, R",2001.0,"2001 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-10, CONFERENCE RECORD",,https://doi.org/
Numerical modeling of tubular daylighting devices,"Tubular daylighting device (TDD) or light pipe is an effective way of energy saving and has been found increasing acceptance for indoor lighting. This article presents a new method to evaluate the TDD's optical performance by the output luminous flux. The method is using position (alpha, d) and angular distribution of luminous flux (phi, theta, Phi) information to describe the optical properties of the TDD's light collecting cover. With the optical information, the ray tracing simulates the output luminous flux basing on the structural and reflectivity of the light pipe. Our method makes a complete optical description of light ray passing through a top cover, thus enable the subsequent ray tracing of light pipe. As an application, lambertian beam pattern is used as light source which goes through from the cover, and then the results on various length to diameter ratios of light pipes are compared.

Automating test oracles from restricted natural language agile requirements,"Manual testing of software requirements written in natural language for agile or any other methodology requires more time and human resources. This leaves the testing process error prone and time consuming. For satisfied end users with bug-free software delivered on time, there is a need to automate the test oracle process for natural language or informal requirements. The automation of the test oracle is relatively easier with formal requirements, but this task is difficult to achieve with natural language requirements. This study proposes an approach calledRestricted Natural Language Agile Requirements Testing(ReNaLART) to automate the test oracle from restricted natural language agile requirements. For this purpose, it uses an existing user story template with some modifications for writing user stories. This helps in identifying test input and expected output for a user story. For comparison of expected and observed outputs it makes use of a regex pattern and string distance functions. It is capable of assigning different types of verdicts automatically depending upon the similarity/dissimilarity between observed and expected outputs of user stories. ReNaLART is validated using several case studies of different domains, namely, OLX Pakistan, Mental Health Tests, McDelivery Pakistan, BlueStacks, Power Searching with Google, TensorFlow Playground, w3Schools 2018 offline and Touch'D. It revealed several faults in five of the above listed eight applications. Plus, the proposed test oracle on an average took 0.02 s for test data generation, expected output generation and verdict assignment. Both these facts show the fault revealing effectiveness and efficiency of ReNaLART.","Malik, Maryam Imtiaz; Sindhu, Muddassar Azam; Khattak, Akmal Saeed; Abbasi, Rabeeh Ayaz; Saleem, Khalid",2021.0,EXPERT SYSTEMS,10.1111/exsy.12608,https://doi.org/10.1111/exsy.12608
A test case refactoring approach for pattern-based software development,"In the current trend, Extreme Programing methodology is widely adopted by small and medium-sized projects for dealing with rapidly or indefinite changing requirements. Test-first strategy and code refactoring are the important practices of Extreme Programing for rapid development and quality support. The test-first strategy emphasizes that test cases are designed before system implementation to keep the correctness of artifacts during software development; whereas refactoring is the removal of bad smell code for improving quality without changing its semantics. However, the test-first strategy may conflict with code refactoring in the sense that the original test cases may be broken or inefficient for testing programs, which are revised by code refactoring. In general, the developers revise the test cases manually since it is not complicated. However, when the developers perform a pattern-based refactoring to improve the quality, the effort of revising the test cases is much more than that in simple code refactoring. In our observation, a pattern-based refactoring is composed of many simple and atomic code refactorings. If we have the composition relationship and the mapping rules between code refactoring and test case refactoring, we may infer a test case revision guideline in pattern-based refactoring. Based on this idea, in this research, we propose a four-phase approach to guide the construction of the test case refactoring for design patterns. We also introduce our approach by using some well-known design patterns and evaluate its feasibility by means of test coverage.","Chu, Peng-Hua; Hsueh, Nien-Lin; Chen, Hong-Hsiang; Liu, Chien-Hung",2012.0,SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL,10.1007/s11219-011-9143-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11219-011-9143-x
TDD Pattern Estimation and Auto-Recovery from Estimation Error for Accommodations of Fronthaul and Secondary Services in TDM-PON,"Time division multiplexing passive optical networks (TDM-PONs) are attracting attention as a cost-effective way of realizing mobile fronthaul (MFH), which is an optical link between a central unit (CU) and a distributed unit (DU) in a centralized radio access network (C-RAN). To realize an even more cost-effective network, we have studied the accommodation of MFH and secondary services in a single TDM-PON. We focus on the fact that a time division duplex (TDD) scheme will be applied to future radio access (FRA). Since a PON link is a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme, whereas a radio propagation link is a TDD scheme, unallocated intervals occur periodically in the PON link. For the above reason, we have already proposed a technique for estimating unallocated intervals in a TDD-based MFH link that involves pre-learning based on a test signal transmission, and the signal of the secondary service is accommodated in the unallocated intervals. However, a scheme for recovering from an error when the estimation is wrong and the test signal is not transmitted has yet to be studied. This paper proposes an estimation technique without a test signal transmission and an estimation-error recovery scheme. The proposed estimator calculates the correlation coefficient between captured uplink traffic and the seven types of uplink and downlink ratio patterns standardized by the third generation partnership project (3GPP: http://www.3gpp.org/).We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation technique by using a numerical simulation. The recovery scheme detects the estimation error and re-allocates the bandwidth. We implement the estimator and the recovery scheme in a 10 Gigabit Ethernet PON (10G-EPON) prototype. We report the feasibility of the proposed scheme along with experimental results.","Hisano, Daisuke; Uzawa, Hiroyuki; Nakayama, Yu; Shimada, Tatsuya; Terada, Jun; Otaka, Akihiro",2018.0,JOURNAL OF OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING,10.1364/JOCN.10.000104,https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.10.000104
"Ecosystem-level carbon storage and its links to diversity, structural and environmental drivers in tropical forests of Western Ghats, India","Tropical forests are rich in biodiversity with great potential for carbon (C) storage. We estimated ecosystem-level C stock using data from 70 forest plots in three major forest types: tropical dry deciduous (TDD I and TDD II), tropical semi-evergreen (TSE I and TSE II) and tropical evergreen forests (TEF I, TEF II and TEF III) of Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India. The average C stock in these forests was 336.8 Mg C/ha, of which 231.3, 3.0, 2.4, 15.2 and 84.9 Mg C/ha were stored in woody vegetation, understorey, litter, deadwood and soil respectively. The live vegetation, detritus and soil contributed 65.5%, 5.5% and 29% respectively to the total ecosystem-level C stock and distributed in forest types in the order: TEF III>TEF II>TEF I>TSE I>TDD II>TSE II>TDD I. The plant diversity, structural attributes and environmental factors showed significant positive correlations with C stocks and accounted for 6.7, 77.2 and 16% of variance. These findings indicate that the tropical forests in the Western Ghats store large amount of C, and resulting data are invaluable for planning and monitoring forest conservation and management programs to enhance C storage in tropical forests.","Kothandaraman, Subashree; Dar, Javid Ahmad; Sundarapandian, Somaiah; Dayanandan, Selvadurai; Khan, Mohammed Latif",2020.0,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/s41598-020-70313-6,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70313-6

Inferring spatial and temporal behavioral patterns of free-ranging manatees using saltwater sensors of telemetry tags,"Diving or respiratory behavior in aquatic mammals can be used as an indicator of physiological activity and consequently, to infer behavioral patterns. Five Antillean manatees, Trichechus manatus manatus, were captured in Chetumal Bay and tagged with GPS tracking devices. The radios were equipped with a micropower saltwater sensor (SWS), which records the times when the tag assembly was submerged. The information was analyzed to establish individual fine-scale behaviors. For each fix, we established the following variables: distance (D), sampling interval (T), movement rate (D/T), number of dives (N), and total diving duration (TDD). We used logic criteria and simple scatterplots to distinguish between behavioral categories: 'Travelling' (D/T >= 3 km/h), 'Surface' (down arrow TDD, down arrow N), 'Bottom feeding' (up arrow TDD, up arrow N) and 'Bottom resting' (up arrow TDD,down arrow N). Habitat categories were qualitatively assigned: Lagoon, Channels, Caye shore, City shore, Channel edge, and Open areas. The instrumented individuals displayed a daily rhythm of bottom activities, with surfacing activities more frequent during the night and early in the morning. More investigation into those cycles and other individual fine-scale behaviors related to their proximity to concentrations of human activity would be informative.

"Variation in soil organic carbon stock with forest type in tropical forests of Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India","Sequestration of atmospheric carbon-dioxide in biospheric carbon (C) pools is a key strategy towards climate change mitigation. Soil is a huge C reservoir and its storage potential varies greatly with forest types. Therefore, in the present study, the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage pattern was assessed from 70 plots laid at three selected forest types comprising seven study sites at Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India: tropical dry deciduous (TDD I and TDD II), tropical semi-evergreen (TSE I and TSE II) and tropical evergreen forest (TEF I, TEF II and TEF III) at three depths (0-10, 10.1-20 and 20.1-30 cm). Statistical analyses were performed to understand the relationships between SOC stocks with other predictor variables. The SOC stock varied markedly with forest type and site-wise. The SOC ranged from 58 (TEF III) to 123.6 (TDD I) Mg C/ha with a mean of 84.9 +/- 4.4 Mg C/ha at 0-30 cm depth. SOC stock decreased, while soil bulk density increased with increase in soil depth. The TDD forest type (115.6 Mg C/ha) stocked the highest SOC compared to TEF (75.1 Mg C/ha) and TSE (68.9 Mg C/ha) forest types. Of the total SOC stock (0-30 cm), 44.2, 32.0 and 23.8% were stored in 0-10, 10.1-20 and 20.1-30 cm respectively in all the forest types. In contrast, litter C stock were high in TEF and TSE forest types and low in TDD forest type. SOC showed significant (P < 0.01) negative relationships with bulk density, litter C, and vegetation attributes. The SOC stock stored in the study sites amount to 212.9 (TEF III) to 453.6 (TDD I) Mg of CO2 equivalents. The present study reveals that forest type and site characteristics have a profound impact on SOC stock, which would, in turn, exert a great bearing on the ecosystem C cycling. These results would also enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forest types in soil C sequestration and for developing and validating SOC models for tropical forest ecosystems.","Subashree, Kothandaraman; Dar, Javid Ahmad; Sundarapandian, Somaiah",2019.0,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,10.1007/s10661-019-7881-6,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7881-6
On Time-Dependent Trip Distance Distribution with For-Hire Vehicle Trips in Chicago,"For transportation system analysis in a new space dimension with respect to individual trips' remaining distances, vehicle trips demand has two main components: the departure time and the trip distance. In particular, the trip distance distribution (TDD) is a direct input to the bathtub model in the new space dimension, and is a very important variable to consider in many applications, such as the development of distance-based congestion pricing strategies or mileage tax. For a good understanding of the demand pattern, both the distribution of trip initiation and trip distance should be calibrated from real data. In this paper, it is assumed that the demand pattern can be described by the joint distribution of trip distance and departure time. In other words, TDD is assumed to be time-dependent, and a calibration and validation methodology of the joint probability is proposed, based on log-likelihood maximization and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The calibration method is applied to empirical for-hire vehicle trips in Chicago, and it is concluded that TDD varies more within a day than across weekdays. The hypothesis that TDD follows a negative exponential, log-normal, or Gamma distribution is rejected. However, the best fit is systematically observed for the time-dependent log-normal probability density function. In the future, other trip distributions should be considered and also non-parametric probability density estimation should be explored for a better understanding of the demand pattern.","Martinez, Irene; Jin, Wen-Long",2021.0,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,10.1177/03611981211021552,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981211021552
"Application of a Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network in a 3-D Global Electron Density Model Using the Long-Term Observations of COSMIC, Fengyun-3C, and Digisonde","The ionosphere plays an important role in satellite navigation, radio communication, and space weather prediction. However, it is still a challenging mission to develop a model with high predictability that captures the horizontal-vertical features of ionospheric electrodynamics. In this study, multiple observations during 2005-2019 from space-borne global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) systems (COSMIC and FY-3C) and the Digisonde Global Ionosphere Radio Observatory are utilized to develop a completely global ionospheric three-dimensional electron density model based on an artificial neural network, namely ANN-TDD. The correlation coefficients of the predicted profiles all exceed 0.96 for the training, validation and test datasets, and the minimum root-mean-square error of the predicted residuals is 7.8 x 10(4) el/cm(3). Under quiet space weather, the predicted accuracy of the ANN-TDD is 30%-60% higher than the IRI-2016 at the Millstone Hill and Jicamarca incoherent scatter radars. However, the ANN-TDD is less capable of predicting ionospheric dynamic evolution under severe geomagnetic storms compared to the IRI-2016 with the STORM option activated. Additionally, the ANN-TDD successfully reproduces the large-scale horizontal-vertical ionospheric electrodynamic features, including seasonal variation and hemispheric asymmetries. These features agree well with the structure revealed by the RO profiles derived from the FORMOSAT/COSMIC-2 mission. Furthermore, the ANN-TDD successfully captures the prominent regional ionospheric patterns, including the equatorial ionization anomaly, Weddell Sea anomaly and mid-latitude summer nighttime anomaly. The new model is expected to play an important role in the application of GNSS navigation and in the explanation of the physical mechanisms involved.","Li, Wang; Zhao, Dongsheng; He, Changyong; Shen, Yi; Hu, Andong; Zhang, Kefei",2021.0,SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,10.1029/2020SW002605,https://doi.org/10.1029/2020SW002605
A node architecture for disaster relief networking,"In this paper we present a node architecture for a personal node in a cognitive ad-hoc disaster relief network. This architecture is motivated from the network system requirements, especially single-hop distance and jamming-resilience requirements. It is shown that the power consumption of current-day Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) limits the channel bandwidth that can be used, both for a baseband processing system and the scanning system. We therefore propose to use a form of Frequency Hopping Time Division Multiplexing (FH/TDD) system, similar to Bluetooth. However, we propose to use OFDM as modulation scheme instead of GFSK and show that the OFDM symbol length for the frequency range at hand (400 - 1000 MHz) is consistent with a Bluetooth-alike FH/TDD scheme. We propose to modify the FH/TDD scheme to incorporate a radio-spectrum measurement phase. Based on these measurements carriers in the OFDM-based scheme are selected in such a fashion that legacy users are avoided. In case of too much legacy-user spectral usage hopping patterns may be altered.","Hoeksema, F; Heskamp, M; Schiphorst, R; Slump, K",2005.0,"2005 1ST IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON NEW FRONTIERS IN DYNAMIC SPECTRUM ACCESS NETWORKS, CONFERENCE RECORD",,https://doi.org/

Chaste: An Open Source C plus plus Library for Computational Physiology and Biology,"Chaste - Cancer, Heart And Soft Tissue Environment - is an open source C++ library for the computational simulation of mathematical models developed for physiology and biology. Code development has been driven by two initial applications: cardiac electrophysiology and cancer development. A large number of cardiac electrophysiology studies have been enabled and performed, including high-performance computational investigations of defibrillation on realistic human cardiac geometries. New models for the initiation and growth of tumours have been developed. In particular, cell-based simulations have provided novel insight into the role of stem cells in the colorectal crypt. Chaste is constantly evolving and is now being applied to a far wider range of problems. The code provides modules for handling common scientific computing components, such as meshes and solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Re-use of these components avoids the need for researchers to 're-invent the wheel' with each new project, accelerating the rate of progress in new applications. Chaste is developed using industrially-derived techniques, in particular test-driven development, to ensure code quality, re-use and reliability. In this article we provide examples that illustrate the types of problems Chaste can be used to solve, which can be run on a desktop computer. We highlight some scientific studies that have used or are using Chaste, and the insights they have provided.

Cathodoluminescence and TEM investigations of structural and optical properties of AlGaN on epitaxial laterally overgrown AlN/sapphire templates,"Surface steps as high as 15 nm on up to 10 mu m thick AlN layers grown on patterned AlN/sapphire templates play a major role for the structural and optical properties of AlxGa1-xN layers with x >= 0.5 grown subsequently by metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. The higher the Ga content in these layers is, the stronger is the influence of the surface morphology on their properties. For x = 0.5 not only periodic inhomogeneities in the Al content due to growth of Ga-rich facets are observed by cathodoluminescence, but these facets give rise to additional dislocation formation as discovered by annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. For AlxGa1-xN layers with x = 0.8 the difference in Al content between facets and surrounding material is much smaller. Therefore, the threading dislocation density (TDD) is only defined by the TDD in the underlying epitaxially laterally overgrown (ELO) AlN layer. This way high quality Al0.8Ga0.2N with a thickness up to 1.5 mu m and a TDD <= 5x10(8) cm(-2) was obtained.","Zeimer, U.; Mogilatenko, A.; Kueller, V.; Knauer, A.; Weyers, M.",2013.0,18TH MICROSCOPY OF SEMICONDUCTING MATERIALS CONFERENCE (MSM XVIII),10.1088/1742-6596/471/1/012021,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/471/1/012021

"Cochannel interference reduction in dynamic-TDD fixed wireless applications, using time slot allocation algorithms","In this paper, we consider a fixed wireless cellular network that uses dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD). We analyze the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) outage performance of a D-TDD fixed cellular system, and propose a scheme to improve the outage probability performance. First, outage probability is evaluated using an analytical model, when omnidirectional antennas are deployed at a base-station site and a subscriber site. Our model is verified, using Monte Carlo simulations. According to our investigation, the outage performance of the D-TDD system is severely limited by a strong interference from the cochannel cell on the downlink, while the reference cell is in the uplink cycle. To improve the outage performance during uplink receptions, we introduce two time-slot allocation methods, combined with sector antennas: the Max Min{SIR} and Max{SIR}. The Max Min{SIR} is an exhaustive search algorithm for assigning subscribers to a few extra uplink time slots, so as to maximize the minimum SIR expectation value over the extra uplink time-slots region. It is used as a performance benchmark in our analysis. Meanwhile, the Max{SIR} is a simpler and efficient algorithm for improving the outage performance. It is established that the performance difference between the two algorithms is not noticeable. Especially, the difference is negligible, when the dynamic range of the traffic pattern between uplink and downlink is small. Also, the outage performance of a system that employs the Max{SIR} algorithm combined with sectored antennas is compared to that of a system employing adaptive-array antennas. The proposed system shows promise, and offers a compromise between system complexity and network guaranteed availability.","Jeong, WC; Kavehrad, M",2002.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS,10.1109/TCOMM.2002.803991,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.803991
Aperture Coupled Wideband Dielectric Resonator Antenna Array with Polarization Reconfiguration,"Four elements aperture coupled cylindrical shaped Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) circular array is proposed for generating reconfigurable polarization radiation patterns. In this array, all the elements are sequentially fed to generate circular polarization. The linear and circular polarizations of the DRA array are achieved by exciting the elements in different arrangements. The antenna provides wideband impedance matching (S-11 <= -10 dB) of 39% (2.7 to 4 GHz) which covers RADAR band (2.7-2.9 GHz) and LTE bands (FDD 22 (3.41-3.59 GHz), TDD 42(3.4-3.6 GHz), TDD 43 (3.6-3.8 GHz)) for both linear and circular polarization radiation patterns.","Kumari, Runa; Behera, S.

Analysis of Spectral Efficiency for Licensed Bands WIMAX,"This paper introduces a spectral analysis techniques made from TDD and FDD which are present on the IEEE 802.16 and used by WiMAX in the uplink-downlink bidirectional channels. The simulation model considered in the arrival queue services, the FIFO concept and the simulations were performed considering five applications (Streaming, Download, Web, Email and Small-Transaction) for downlink and uplink. The number of channels on the Base Station varied from 4 to 60, with a throughput of 600 kbps, where the considered efficiency parameter was the minimum number of channels required for each channel pattern. The simulations were performed in three different scenarios for different traffic profiles for downlink and uplink, and the analyzes of the performance, taken as a measure of the efficiency arrival rate and waiting time before the user's typical applications used in-band technology licensed WiMAX, which follows this pattern. The made analysis allowed identifying, given these traffic conditions, which technique is better recommended. It was further observed that in the data traffic asymmetric, the TDD technique was more efficient, and it was noticed an idleness spectrum in the FDD technique.","Savoine, Marcia Maria; Reggiani, Norma; Branquinho, Omar Carvalho",2012.0,2012 IEEE LATIN-AMERICAN CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS,,https://doi.org/
Effects of recent temperature variability and warming on the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season in the northern Baltic Sea,"In cold climate regions, ice roads are engineered as temporary winter transportation routes on frozen lakes, rivers and seas. The ice road season start, end and duration principally depend upon ice thickness, which is controlled by surface air temperature (SAT) in terms of freezing and thawing degree-days (FDD and TDD, respectively). Both FDD and TDD are indicators of climate variability and change, and are naturally influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs). This study examined the role of ACPs in interannual variations in the operating season of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road in the Bay of Bothnia, northern Baltic Sea, during 1974-2009. Significant (p < .05) shortening in duration of the ice road season, mainly attributable to later start and earlier end days, was observed. In the Oulu-Hailuoto area, maximum ice thickness showed significant declines over time. This sea ice thinning was associated with SAT warming in cold months, manifested by statistically significant decreases in cumulative FDD during October-January within the water year (September-August). Significant increases in cumulative TDD during February-April, reflecting warmer SAT in mild months, resulted in earlier end day for the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) was the most influential ACP for variations in cumulative FDD (October-January), and accordingly for sea ice thickness and start day of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. However, cumulative TDD (February-April) showed significant positive correlations with the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, which also controlled the end day of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season.","Kiani, Sepideh; Irannezhad, Masoud; Ronkanen, Anna-Kaisa; Moradkhani, Hamid; Klove, Bjorn",2018.0,COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.02.010,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.02.010
Treatment Patterns and Characteristics of Individuals Initiating High-Dose Insulin for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined patient characteristics and treatment patterns of high-dose insulin therapy (>200 units/day) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). OBJECTIVE: To understand patient characteristics, dosing, adherence, and persistence related to high-dose insulin therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study that used administrative claims from a large national health plan. Patients were identified who had been diagnosed with T2DM and who were aged 18-89 years, enrolled in a commercial or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan, newly initiated on a total daily dose (TDD) >200 units of insulin between January 2011 and August 2015. Patients were required to be enrolled 6 months before and 12 months after the index date. Patients were categorized to Regimen-100 if treated with U-100 insulin only or Regimen-500 if treated with U-500R with or without U-100. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. An adjustment factor for the days supply was calculated as the ratio of median time between insulin claims, and median pharmacy reported days supply for each insulin prescription. Adjusted days supply, quantity, and concentration were used to calculate TDD for each quarter after the index date. Adherence was measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC) for each regimen. Persistence was measured in 2 ways: the percentage of patients remaining on index medications in each quarter and the proportion of patients who maintained TDD >200 units during all 4 quarters of the 12-month post-index period. RESULTS: We identified 2,339 patients newly titrated up to TDD >200 units on either Regimen-100 (2,062, 88.2%) or Regimen-500 (277, 11.8%). Patients on Regimen-500 were slightly younger with higher prevalence of comorbidities. The mean TDD (SD) for Regimen-100 decreased from 228.6 (36.0) units during the first quarter to 194.2 (181.4) units during the last quarter. The mean TDD (SD) for Regimen-500 increased from 294.2 (102.2) units in the first quarter to 304.8 (281.6) units in last quarter. The average adherence to the high-dose insulin regimen was 68.2% (30.7; median 72.6%) for the Regimen-100 cohort and 75.5% (27.0; median 85.2%) for the Regimen-500 cohort. In the Regimen-100 and Regimen-500 cohorts, 45.3% and 55.2% had a PDC >= 80%, respectively. Only 23.0% and 51.6% of patients maintained TDD >200 units for the Regimen-100 and Regimen-500 cohorts, respectively, throughout the 4 quarters after the index date. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that many patients did not maintain high-dose insulin use over time, especially those on standard U-100 insulin only. This dosing pattern appears to reflect the differences in patient characteristics, insulin needs, and adherence/persistence behavior between those on Regimen-100 and those on Regimen-500.

Grouped and Multistep Nanoheteroepitaxy: Toward High-Quality GaN on Quasi-Periodic Nano-Mask,"A novel nanoheteroepitaxy method, namely, the grouped and multistep nanoheteroepitaxy (GM-NHE), is proposed to attain a high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) epilayer by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. This method combines the effects of sub-100 nm nucleation and multistep lateral growth by using a low-cost but unique carbon nanotube mask, which consists of nanoscale growth windows with a quasi-periodic 2D fill factor. It is found that GM-NHE can facilely reduce threading dislocation density (TDD) and modulate residual stress on foreign substrate without any regrowth. As a result, high-quality GaN epilayer is produced with homogeneously low TDD of 4.51 x 10(7) cm(-2) and 2D-modulated stress, and the performance of the subsequent 410 nm near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode is greatly boosted. In this way, with the facile fabrication of nanomask and the one-off epitaxy procedure, GaN epilayer is prominently improved with the assistance of nanotechnology, which demonstrates great application potential for high-efficiency TDD-sensitive optoelectronic and electronic devices.","Feng, Xiaohui; Yu, Tongjun; Wei, Yang; Ji, Cheng; Cheng, Yutian; Zong, Hua; Wang, Kun; Yang, Zhijian; Kang, Xiangning; Zhang, Guoyi; Fan, Shoushan",2016.0,ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,10.1021/acsami.6b05636,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b05636
Reducing stimulated emission threshold power density of AlGaN/AlN multiple quantum wells by nano-trench-patterned AlN template,"We investigate the crystal quality of epitaxy lateral overgrowth (ELOG) AlN layers and the performance of optical pumping AIGaN-based deep-ultraviolet laser diodes (LDs) on two different patterned AlN templates upon sapphire substrate. The full width at half maximum values of (0002) and (10 (1) over bar2) X-ray diffraction rocking curves of the ELOG AlN layer on the nano-net-patterned AlN template are 76 and 306 arcsec, and the values of that on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template are 114 and 357 arcsec, respectively. Nevertheless, the threshold power density (P-th) of the 272-nm lasing from the multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on the nano-trench-patterned AlN template is 11% lower than that on the nanonet-patterned AlN template. The reason is that the continuous low threading dislocation density (TDD) MQWs zones above the ELOG coalescent areas upon trenched patterns are in parallel with the stimulated light emission direction. When light resonates through the continuous low TDD MQWs zones, it has higher optical gain and less non-radiative recombination than the case on the nano-net-patterned AlN template where the low TDD MQWs zones are discontinuous on the light path. The results indicate that not only the crystal quality but also the TDD distribution originated from the ELOG on the patterned templates have crucial influence on the P-th, and trench-patterned template can improve the performance of waveguide LDs with Fabry-Perot cavities.

Polydimethyl siloxane wet etching for three dimensional fabrication of microneedle array and high-aspect-ratio micropillars,"Among various transdermal drug delivery (TDD) approaches, utilizing the microneedles (MNs) not only can penetrate the skin but also deliver the drug with reduced tissue damage, reduced pain, and no bleeding. However, the MNs with larger height are required to overcome the skin barrier for effective TDD. Unlike 2D patterning, etching polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) micropillars for fabrication of 3D microstructures is presented. The PDMS micropillars were first constructed by casting PDMS on the computer numerical control-machined cylindrical microwells, which then went through etching process to obtain the MNs for subsequent fabrication of polymer MNs or high aspect ratio micropillars.

Sounding reference signal pattern design for time division duplex multiple-input multiple-output and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems,"In the long-term evolution (LTE) time division duplex (TDD) systems, base stations (BSs) use uplink sounding reference signals (SRSs) to estimate downlink channel state information (CSI) for downlink beamforming transmissions. In the current SRS pattern scheme, because SRSs of up to eight users are multiplexed on the same time-frequency resources, there exist mutual interferences among these SRSs over fading channels. Thus, the current scheme impacts the estimation accuracy of CSI and degrades the beamforming performance. Based on the characteristics of TDD systems, the authors propose a SRS pattern scheme, in which each user sends SRSs only on the allocated bandwidth instead of on full bandwidth as in the current LTE TDD systems, to eliminate the interferences among SRSs. Simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the current scheme in the estimation accuracy for various frequency-selective and time-selective fading channels. In addition, compared with the current SRS pattern scheme, the proposed SRS pattern scheme is robust to frequency-selective channels, and does not be impacted by the timing offset, and provides the flexibility for the choice of channel estimator at the BS side.","Zhou, B.; Jiang, L.; He, C.; Zhao, S.",2012.0,IET COMMUNICATIONS,10.1049/iet-com.2011.0435,https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-com.2011.0435
Queueing Stability and CSI Probing of a TDD Wireless Network with Interference Alignment,"This paper characterizes the performance of IA technique taking into account the dynamic traffic pattern and the probing/feedback cost. We consider a TDD system where transmitters acquire their CSI (Channel State Information) by decoding the pilot sequences sent by the receivers. Since global CSI knowledge is required for IA, the transmitters have also to exchange their estimated CSIs over a backhaul of limited capacity. Under this setting, we characterize in this paper the stability region of the system and provide a probing algorithm that achieves the max stability region. In addition, we compare the stability region of IA to the one achieved by a TDMA system where each transmitter applies a simple ZF (Zero Forcing technique).","Deghel, Matha; Assaad, Mohamad; Debbah, Merouane",2015.0,2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY (ISIT),,https://doi.org/

This paper will discuss about the design and analysis of waveguide slot antenna for LTE (Long Term Evolution) at a frequency of 2.3 to 2.4 GHz.

The first step involved simulation of antenna design and optimization using 3D Electromagnetic Simulator software. Data simulation results showed that the working frequency of the antenna between 2.30 to. While in the second step, fabrication and measurement were carried out using a spectrum analyser and network analyser. The results obtained from measurements show that the antenna has a frequency between 2.28 to 2.41 GHz with bandwidth 130 MHz. The antenna has a directional radiation pattern with a gain at a frequency of 2.3 MHz of 15.68 dBi.

Role of substrate quality on the performance of semipolar (11(2)over-bar2) InGaN light-emitting diodes,"We compare the optical properties and device performance of unpackaged InGaN/GaN multiplequantum- well light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emitting at similar to 430 nm grown simultaneously on a highcost small-size bulk semipolar (11 (2) over bar2) GaN substrate (Bulk-GaN) and a low-cost large-size (11 (2) over bar2) GaN template created on patterned (10 (1) over bar2) r-plane sapphire substrate (PSS-GaN).

Despite an enhanced light extraction efficiency, the LED grown on PSS-GaN has two-times lower internal quantum efficiency than the LED grown on Bulk-GaN as determined by photoluminescence measurements. The LED grown on PSS-GaN substrate also has about two-times lower output power compared to the LED grown on Bulk-GaN substrate.

Growth of GaN and improvement of lattice curvature using symmetric hexagonal SiO2 patterns in HVPE growth,"We implemented facet and flattening (FF) growth via hydride vapor phase epitaxy, and applied hexagonal SiO2 mask patterns to minimize the final threading dislocation density (TDD). We found that the FF growth technique with hexagonal masks significantly mitigates the lattice curvature. Following multiple growth steps, an isotropic curvature could be observed owing to the planar symmetry of the mask patterns; the radius of curvature was 55 m. Furthermore, TDD was significantly reduced to 6.8 x 10(5) cm(-2). These results indicate that the hexagonal mask technique is effective for improving both lattice curvature and crystalline quality of a GaN substrate.

On using Deep Reinforcement Learning to dynamically derive 5G New Radio TDD pattern,"The deployment of 5G and 6G is highly motivated by the emerging network services that demand more band-width and very low latency. Besides, these services are shifting from dominant Downlink (DL) Traffic to a more equilibrate DL/UpLink (UL) and dominant UL traffic for specific emerging services. One option to accommodate this new behavior is to use Time Duplex Division (TDD), where the radio frame is shared between UL and DL time slots, namely UL/DL pattern. While 4G TDD has a fixed number of configurations that cannot be updated on runtime, SGNR allows complete flexibility to define the UL/DL pattern. Therefore, 5G base stations can dynamically change the pattern to adapt to the type of traffic (i.e., UL or DL). However, the 5G standard does not specify algorithms or solutions to derive the UL/DL pattern. To fill this gap, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that adds intelligence to the base station to self-adapt to the traffic pattern of the cell type. The proposed DRL algorithm monitors UL and DL buffers at the 5G base station to derive the optimal UL/DL pattern in respect to the current traffic configuration. The proposed solution delivers the optimal configuration in a timely and efficient manner. Simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm to avoid buffer overflow and ensure the generality by reacting to traffic pattern changes.","Bagaa, Miloud; Boutiba, Karim; Ksentini, Adlen",2021.0,2021 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM),10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685820,https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685820
Time slot allocation scheme based on a region division in CDMA/TDD systems,"In wireless multimedia networks, there exists traffic asymmetry between uplink and downlink channels. The CDMA/TDD system can alleviate this problem, however previous work in this area can not manage efficiently the traffic asymmetry among cells. In this paper we propose a new time slot allocation scheme that considers the traffic pattern of each cell. To solve the inter-cell interference problem, we divide a cell's area into two regions and we allocate the resource of crossed slots to mobile stations which are existing in the inner-region. This proposed scheme increases the resource utilization and decreases the blocking probability of the system as a whole. And our DARD(Different time slot Allocation based on a Region Division) scheme outperforms conventional SA(Same time slot Allocation) scheme in the heterogeneous traffic environment.","Wie, SH; Cho, DH",2001.0,"IEEE VTC 53RD VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, SPRING 2001, VOLS 1-4, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
Uplink Scheduling and Adjacent-Channel Coupling Loss Analysis for TD-LTE Deployment,"TD-LTE, one of the two duplexing modes in LTE, operates in unpaired spectrum and has the advantages of TDD-based technologies. It is expected that TD-LTE will be more rapidly deployed in near future and most of WiMax operators will upgrade their networks to TD-LTE gradually. Before completely upgrading to TD-LTE, WiMax may coexist with TD-LTE in an adjacent frequency band. In addition, multiple TD-LTE operators may deploy their networks in adjacent bands. When more than one TDD network operates in adjacent frequency bands, severe interference may happen due to adjacent channel interference (ACI) and unsynchronized operations. In this paper, coexistence issues between TD-LTE and other systems are analyzed and coexistence requirements are provided. This paper has three research objectives. First, frame synchronization between TD-LTE and WiMax is discussed by investigating possible combinations of TD-LTE and WiMax configurations. Second, an uplink scheduling algorithm is proposed to utilize a leakage pattern of ACI in synchronized operations. Third, minimum requirements for coexistence in unsynchronized operations are analyzed by introducing a concept of adjacent-channel coupling loss. From the analysis and simulation results, we can see that coexistence of TD-LTE with other TDD systems is feasible if the two networks are synchronized. For the unsynchronized case, some special cell-site engineering techniques may be required to reduce the ACI.","Yeo, Woon-Young; Moon, Sung Ho; Kim, Jae-Hoon",2014.0,SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL,10.1155/2014/685102,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/685102

A Dynamic Subframe Set Power Control Scheme for Interference Mitigation in Reconfigurable TD-LTE Systems,"In 3GPP LTE, TDD spectrum allocation for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) use is a function of a cell's TDD UL/DL configuration which designates which time resources (i.e., subframes) are for UL and which are for DL. TDD dynamic UL/DL reconfiguration, under discussion in LTE Release 12, enables cells to quickly adapt the ratio of allocated UL and DL subframes to changing traffic patterns which can be different for neighboring cells. Having different UL/DL directions for the same subframe in adjacent cells can result in new destructive interference components, i.e., eNB-to-eNB and UE-to-UE, with levels that can significantly differ from one subframe to another. In this paper, UL power control mechanisms are considered to manage such interference, where different sets of UL subframes use different UL power control parameters. In particular, two schemes are studied where, in one, fixed subframe sets are chosen based on expected interference and, in the other, the eNB monitors interference levels in the subframes and dynamically reconfigures the subframe sets accordingly. The performance of each scheme is evaluated through system level simulations and it is shown that the UL power control with dynamic UL subframe set configuration outperforms the one with static UL subframe sets, with significant improvement achieved at cell edge.","Kini, Ananth V.; Hosseinian, Mohsen; Sadeghi, Pouriya; Stern-Berkowitz, Janet",2014.0,2014 23RD WIRELESS AND OPTICAL COMMUNICATION CONFERENCE (WOCC),,https://doi.org/

Integrated sleep scheduling for multiple relays and UEs in LTE-TDD,"Energy-saving for the LTE-A network with relay nodes in TDD mode is addressed in this paper, and integrated sleep scheduling schemes for relay nodes and user devices under a base station are designed.

In the top-down strategy, the load as well as the channel quality on the backhaul link is first considered to determine the sleep pattern for all relay nodes, and then the sleep schedule for UEs under each relay node is determined accordingly. On the contrary, the load and the channel quality on the access links are first considered and then integrated into the sleep schedule on the backhaul link. Two associated mechanisms for the proposed LBPS schemes to operate in the virtual time domain are also proposed in the paper, i.e., calculation of the virtual subframe capacity and the mapping mechanisms from the virtual time to the actual time. The benefit of the proposed schemes in power saving over the standard-based scheme is demonstrated by the simulation study, and the bottom-up scheme of BU-Split outperforms the other schemes under equally distributed input load as well as the hotspot scenario. Discussion on the tradeoff of the processing overhead and the performance for the proposed schemes is presented in the paper.","Yang, Chun-Chuan; Mai, Yi-Ting; Chen, Jeng-Yueng; Yang, Chen-Ming",2019.0,EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING,10.1186/s13638-019-1537-7,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13638-019-1537-7
Antenna Switching Scheme for Downlink Time Switched Transmit Diversity with ARQ in the WCDMA LCR-TDD System,"In this paper, the antenna switching scheme is proposed for Time Switched Transmit Diversity (TSTD) with ARQ (automatic repeat request) in WCDMA LCR-TDD systems, and the system performances are also investigated. The proposed TSTD system employs the ARQ scheme in which the receiver sends the acknowledgement signal (ACK or NACK) to the transmitter in order to predict the condition of the channel. For the ARQ-aided TSTD system, the proposed antenna switching pattern triggers the transmit antenna switches. Simulation results demonstrate that the performances of the TSTD systems can be improved by applying the ARQ scheme. Furthermore, the performances of ARQ-aided TSTD systems may be significantly improved by applying the proposed antenna switching scheme, especially when the mobile speed is low.","Jeon, Cha-Eul; Hwang, Seung-Hoon; Choi, Byoung-Jo",2009.0,"2009 IEEE 20TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERSONAL, INDOOR AND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS",10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449879,https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449879
Enhanced photoluminescence from GaN grown by lateral confined epitaxy,"Lateral confined epitaxy (LCE) of GaN on Si substrates results in a reduction of thermal crack density with decreasing the lateral dimensions of the growth pattern. Below a critical size, crack-free GaN on Si is obtained. The intensity of band-to-band photoluminescence (PL) peak in LCE GaN is strongly enhanced with respect to uniformly grown GaN on Si. The present study rules out the effect of crack density, internal reflections (microcavity effects), as well as enhanced light extraction efficiency, and excitation or emission through preferred facets (shape effects) as the main factor in PL enhancement. It is shown that the reduction in threading dislocation density (TDD) along the edges of the LCE patterns improves the luminescence efficiency. The relative increase in high quality material (low TDD) with the reduction of LCE unit size is, thus, the main reason for the enhanced PL intensity.

INCORPORATING GEOSTROPHIC WIND INFORMATION FOR IMPROVED SPACE-TIME SHORT-TERM WIND SPEED FORECASTING,"Accurate short-term wind speed forecasting is needed for the rapid development and efficient operation of wind energy resources. This is, however, a very challenging problem. Although on the large scale, the wind speed is related to atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other meteorological variables, no improvement in forecasting accuracy was found by incorporating air pressure and temperature directly into an advanced space-time statistical forecasting model, the trigonometric direction diurnal (TDD) model. This paper proposes to incorporate the geostrophic wind as a new predictor in the TDD model. The geostrophic wind captures the physical relationship between wind and pressure through the observed approximate balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis acceleration due to the Earth's rotation. Based on our numerical experiments with data from West Texas, our new method produces more accurate forecasts than does the TDD model using air pressure and temperature for 1-to 6-hour-ahead forecasts based on three different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, forecasting errors can be further reduced by using moving average hourly wind speeds to fit the diurnal pattern. For example, our new method obtains between 13.9% and 22.4% overall mean absolute error reduction relative to persistence in 2-hour-ahead forecasts, and between 5.3% and 8.2% reduction relative to the best previous space-time methods in this setting.","Zhu, Xinxin; Bowman, Kenneth P.; Genton, Marc G.",2014.0,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,10.1214/14-AOAS756,https://doi.org/10.1214/14-AOAS756
Reduced Threading Dislocation Density in a Ge Epitaxial Film on a Submicron-Patterned Si Substrate Grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition,"A patterned Si substrate is used to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) in a Ge epitaxial film for near-infrared photonic device applications. Using photolithography and dry etching, an array of submicron-wide strips with a rectangular cross-section is patterned in the [110] direction of a Si (001) wafer. A Ge film as thick as 1 mu m is grown on the patterned Si by chemical vapor deposition with an ordinary two-step growth method, where a buffer layer of pure Ge as thin as 50 nm is grown at a low temperature of 370 degrees C, followed by growth at an elevated temperature of 700 degrees C. A Ge film is formed with a reasonably flat surface despite the non-flat starting Si surface as well as the large lattice mismatch of 4.2% between Ge and Si. The etch-pit density measurements for the Ge film exhibits TDD of about 6 x 10(7) cm(-2), which is significantly lower than that of about 2 x 10(8) cm(-2) for the film on the unpatterned region prepared on the same Si substrate. The TDD reduction is attributed to a trapping of the dislocations in the trench regions between the Si strips, as observed in cross-sectional transmission electron microscope images.","Amin, Mohd Faiz Bin; Hizawa, Takeshi; Piedra-Lorenzana, Jose A.

Which factors predict glycemic control in children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes before 6.5 years of age?,"Predictors of long-term glycemic control and growth patterns in children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) before 6.5 years of age were evaluated. One hundred seventy-three children (84 boys) with a mean diabetes duration of 4.9 +/- A 2.8 years participated in this observational study. Medical charts were reviewed for background, disease- and treatment-related parameters, and growth parameters. Study endpoints were HbA1c value, rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis events, and growth patterns. Mean HbA1c for the total duration of diabetes (HbA1c-TDD) was 7.9 +/- A 0.8%. Comparison of the study variables between patients with HbA1c-TDD < 7.5% (n = 53) or a parts per thousand yen7.5% yielded a significantly shorter duration of diabetes (P = 0.01) and lower rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (P = 0.02) in those with HbA1C-TDD < 7.5%, without differences between these groups in age at diabetes onset, insulin regimens, daily glucose measurements, and rate of severe hypoglycemia. Factors significantly predicting achievement of the mean target HbA1c-TDD < 7.5% were lower HbA1c at 0.5 years and 1 year after diabetes diagnosis (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). Patients followed for at least 5 years (n = 48) showed a significant decrease in height-SDS (P < 0.001) and a significant increase in weight-SDS (P = 0.004) from diabetes diagnosis to the last follow-up visit, without a significant change in weight-SDS from 0.5 years after diagnosis to the last follow-up visit. Our results suggest that in patients with T1D diagnosed during the preschool-age, mean HbA1c level in the first year is a strong predictor of achieving target HbA1c level in the subsequent years, regardless the type of insulin regimen. This metabolic tracking emphasizes the importance of achieving early optimal control even in younger children.","Shalitin, S.; Phillip, M.",2012.0,ACTA DIABETOLOGICA,10.1007/s00592-011-0321-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00592-011-0321-x
Reduced dislocation density in GaxIn1-xP compositionally graded buffer layers through engineered glide plane switch,"In this work we develop control over dislocation glide dynamics in Ga(x)ln(1-x)P compositionally graded buffer layers (CGBs) through control of CuPt ordering on the group-III sublattice. The ordered structure is metastable in the bulk, so any glissile dislocation that disrupts the ordered pattern will release stored energy, and experience an increased glide force. Here we show how this connection between atomic ordering and dislocation glide force can be exploited to control the threading dislocation density (TDD) in GaxIn1-xP CGBs. When ordered GaxIn1-xP is graded from the GaAs lattice constant to InP, the order parameter eta decreases as x decreases, and dislocation glide switches from one set of glide planes to the other. This glide plane switch (GPS) is accompanied by the nucleation of dislocations on the new glide plane, which typically leads to increased TDD. We develop control of the GPS position within a GaxIn1-xP CGB through manipulation of deposition temperature, surfactant concentration, and strain-grading rate. We demonstrate a two-stage GaxIn1-xP CGB from GaAs to InP with sufficiently low TDD for high performance devices, such as the 4-junction inverted metamorphic multi-junction solar cell, achieved through careful control the GPS position. Experimental results are analyzed within the context of a model that considers the force balance on dislocations on the two competing glide planes as a function of the degree of ordering.","Schulte, K.

On Channel Estimation of Uplink TDD Massive MIMO Systems Through Different Pilot Structures,"This work is considered as a comparative study in which the quality of channel estimation (CE) in massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) systems is studied by operating atUplink (UL) phase according to a time division duplex (TDD) scheme using commonly known channel estimators existing in the literature. The least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimators are investigated with three categories of pilots, namely regular pilots (RPs), time-superimposed (or superimposed) pilots and staggered pilots (StP). Two patterns of frequency reuse (FR) per category are used. The simulation results showed that by increasing the number of BS antennas with a fixed number of symbols dedicated to the UL phase and vice versa, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the LS and MMSE estimators using the superimposed pilot (SuP) or StP is asymptotically approaches the NMSE of the LS and MMSE estimators using the RP, respectively. An asymptotic behavior is studied for two different FR scenarios.","Amadid, Jamal; Boulouird, Mohamed; Riadi, Abdelhamid; Hassani, Moha M'Rabet",2022.0,"NETWORKING, INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND SECURITY",10.1007/978-981-16-3637-0_12,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-3637-0_12
Structural properties of relaxed thin film germanium layers grown by low temperature RF-PECVD epitaxy on Si and Ge (100) substrates,"We report on unusual low temperature (175 degrees C) heteroepitaxial growth of germanium thin films using a standard radio-frequency plasma process. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveal a perfect crystalline quality of epitaxial germanium layers on (100) c-Ge wafers. In addition direct germanium crystal growth is achieved on (100) c-Si, despite 4.2% lattice mismatch. Defects rising from Ge/Si interface are mostly located within the first tens of nanometers, and threading dislocation density (TDD) values as low as 10(6) cm(-2) are obtained. Misfit stress is released fast: residual strain of -0.4% is calculated from Moire pattern analysis. Moreover we demonstrate a striking feature of low temperature plasma epitaxy, namely the fact that crystalline quality improves with thickness without epitaxy breakdown, as shown by TEM and depth profiling of surface TDD.

A study of GaN nucleation and coalescence in the initial growth stages on nanoscale patterned sapphire substrates via MOCVD,"GaN growth on cone-shaped nanoscale patterned sapphire substrates (NPSS) in the initial stages was investigated via a series of growth interruptions. The thickness of the nucleation layer (NL) was optimized as 15 nm. A high-quality GaN film was achieved with an average surface roughness of 0.13 nm over 5 x 5 m(2), a threading dislocation density (TDD) of 1.80 x 10(8) cm(-2) and a residual stress of 0.40 GPa. X-ray diffraction (XRD) /phi-scans, cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out to study the GaN coalescence process on NPSS. Nano-nucleating, lateral growth and the submerging of the large tilt grains were confirmed as the primary factors that reduced the TDD and residual stress. The mechanism for GaN nucleation on NPSS and its effect on the subsequent growth stages were elucidated.","Chen, Yifan; Chen, Zhizhong; Li, Junze; Chen, Yiyong; Li, Chengcheng; Zhan, Jinglin; Yu, Tongjun; Kang, Xiangning; Jiao, Fei; Li, Shunfeng; Zhang, Guoyi; Shen, Bo",2018.0,CRYSTENGCOMM,10.1039/c8ce01450g,https://doi.org/10.1039/c8ce01450g
On Policy Based RAN Slicing for Emerging 5G TDD Networks,"This paper introduces the concept of soft Policy based Slicing in the emerging SG Time Division Duplex (TDD) networks, considering varying traffic conditions and asymmetric application usage patterns. The proposed approach relies on a flexible service-oriented slicing considering diverse applications with heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) demands in terms of throughput, latency, etc. It introduces a separate and customized Uplink/Downlink (UL/DL) pattern per slice taking into account the desired Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is mapped on to a QoS policy for facilitating slicing of the radio access resources. Such a QoS policy allows the flexible allocation of Resource Blocks (RBs) considering the entire spectrum for individual services, while a dynamic resource variation additionally allocates temporarily unused RBs to particular slices in need. The end-to-end system aspects considering the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network orchestration and management architecture are also discussed and an exhaustive simulation campaign is conducted to validate our proposals against the current state-of-the-art.","Shrivastava, Rudraksh; Samdanis, Konstantinos; Bakry, Ahmed",2018.0,2018 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM),,https://doi.org/
Templated site-selective deposition of titanium dioxide on self-assembled monolayers,"TiO2 thin films were grown on several kinds of SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) using TC (titanium tetrachloride), TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide), or TE (titanium tetraethoxide) as a starting material. We discussed the thin film formation mechanism and improvement of feature edge acuity through controlling the reactivity by changing functional groups of starting material and the surface functional groups of SAMs. The deposition of TiO2 from TC or TDD solution was promoted in the silanol group, and the deposition was suppressed on OTS (octadecyltrichloro-silane) SAM. On the other hand, TE was deposited regardless of the type of surface functional group in the whole area of patterned SAMs. The silanol group, which has high hydrophilicity, accelerated the growth of TiO2, and the OTS SAM, which has hydrophobicity, suppressed the growth of TiO2. It is also clarified that the chlorine atom in the starting material has high reactivity with silanol groups of SAMs.","Masuda, Y; Jinbo, Y; Yonezawa, T; Koumoto, K",2002.0,CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS,10.1021/cm0107528,https://doi.org/10.1021/cm0107528
Learning Personalized Codebook for TDD Non-Antenna Switching System,"In this paper we investigate the codebook design for a time division duplex (TDD) non-antenna switching system, where the user device is equipped with two receive radio frequency (RF) chains but only one transmit RF chain. To acquire the channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), we resort to a mixture of channel sounding and limited feedback, where the former is employed to obtain the CSIT of the antenna connected to the transmit RF chain and the latter is employed for the other antenna. We propose a deep learning method to design the codebook for limited feedback. The learned codebook is distinguished from the traditional ones in two ways. First, the learned codebook is so-called personalized, which is not fixed but adapt to the partially known CSIT. Second, the codebook exhibits different beam patterns from the traditional codebook that is designed for quantization error minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned codebook can achieve higher data rate with lower complexity than traditional codebook.","Miao, Heng; Han, Shengqian; Li, Yinghan; Yang, Chenyang",2020.0,PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 IEEE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICSP 2020),10.1109/ICSP48669.2020.9320967,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSP48669.2020.9320967
SHAPES OF INDEPENDENT ATOMS AND CHEMICAL DEFORMATION DENSITIES OF 2ND-ROW MOLECULES,"It is suggested that the information about chemical bonding contained in the total electron density distribution should be split into three parts. First, the standard crystallographic parameters (i.e. the atomic positions which are most appropriate for bond formation); these give rise to the standard total difference density (TDD). Second, the shapes of degenerate atomic ground states appropriate for optimal interatomic interactions, giving rise to the novel chemical deformation density (CDD). Third, the genuine chemical deformation of the atoms in the molecule or crystal. This approach was applied to more than 40 molecules consisting mainly of second-row atoms (lithium to fluorine) and hydrogen. Contrary to the standard TDD, the novel CDD gives a very consistent pattern of covalent bond and lone pair densities, even for electron-rich atoms. The atomic shape parameters comprise valence atomic orbital directions and populations. They correlate very well with the type of bonding of the atoms in the molecule.","SCHWARZ, WHE; LIN, HL; IRLE, S; NIU, JE",1992.0,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE-THEOCHEM,,https://doi.org/
A Framework of Temporal-Spatial Descriptors-Based Feature Extraction for Improved Myoelectric Pattern Recognition,"The extraction of the accurate and efficient descriptors of muscular activity plays an important role in tackling the challenging problem of myoelectric control of powered prostheses. In this paper, we present a new feature extraction framework that aims to give an enhanced representation of muscular activities through increasing the amount of information that can be extracted from individual and combined electromyogram (EMG) channels. We propose to use time-domain descriptors (TDDs) in estimating the EMG signal power spectrum characteristics; a step that preserves the computational power required for the construction of spectral features. Subsequently, TDD is used in a process that involves: 1) representing the temporal evolution of the EMG signals by progressively tracking the correlation between the TDD extracted from each analysis time window and a nonlinearly mapped version of it across the same EMG channel and 2) representing the spatial coherence between the different EMG channels, which is achieved by calculating the correlation between the TDD extracted from the differences of all possible combinations of pairs of channels and their nonlinearly mapped versions. The proposed temporal-spatial descriptors (TSDs) are validated on multiple sparse and high-density (HD) EMG data sets collected from a number of intact-limbed and amputees performing a large number of hand and finger movements. Classification results showed significant reductions in the achieved error rates in comparison to other methods, with the improvement of at least 8% on average across all subjects. Additionally, the proposed TSDs achieved significantly well in problems with HD-EMG with average classification errors of <5% across all subjects using windows lengths of 50 ms only.","Khushaba, Rami N.; Al-Timemy, Ali H.; Al-Ani, Ahmed; Al-Jumaily, Adel",2017.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING,10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2687520,https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2687520
Effects of gestational thiamine-deprivation and/or exposure to ethanol on crucial offspring rat brain enzyme activities,"Objective: The fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a group of clinical conditions associated with the in utero exposure to ethanol (EtOH). We have recently examined the effects of a moderate maternal exposure to EtOH on crucial brain enzyme activities in offspring rats, and discussed the translational challenges arising when attempting to simulate any of the clinical conditions associated with FASD. Materials and methods: In this current study, we: (i) address the need for a more consistent and reliable in vivo experimental platform that could simulate milder cases of FASD complicated by simultaneous thiamine-deprivation during gestation and (ii) explore the effects of such a moderate maternal exposure pattern to EtOH and a thiamine-deficient diet (TDD) on crucial enzyme activities in the offspring rat brains. Results: We demonstrate a significant decrease in the newborn and 21-day-old offspring body and brain weight due to maternal dietary thiamine-deprivation, as well as evidence of crucial brain enzyme activity alterations that in some cases are present in the offspring rat brains long after birth (and the end of the maternal exposure to both EtOH and TDD). Conclusions: Our findings provide a preliminary characterization of important neurochemical effects due to maternal exposure to EtOH and TDD during gestation that might affect the offspring rat neurodevelopment, and that characterization should be further explored in a brain region-specific manner level as well as through the parallel examination of changes in the offspring rat brain lipid composition.","Stolakis, Vasileios; Liapi, Charis; Al-Humadi, Hussam; Kalafatakis, Konstantinos; Gkanti, Vasiliki; Bimpis, Alexios; Skandali, Nikolina; Tsela, Smaragda; Theocharis, Stamatios; Zarros, Apostolos; Tsakiris, Stylianos",2021.0,JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE,10.1080/14767058.2019.1667973,https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2019.1667973
Development of 260 nm band deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes on Si substrates,"Deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have a wide range of potential applications, such as sterilization, water purification, and medicine. In recent years, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the performance of AlGaN-based DUV LEDs on sapphire substrates have increased markedly due to improvements in the crystalline-quality of high Al-content AlGaN layers, and the optimization of LED structures. On the other hand, DUV LEDs fabricated on Si substrates are very promising as a low-cost DUV light-source in the near future. However, AlN layers on Si have suffered from cracking induced by the large mismatch in lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients between AlN and Si. In this paper, DUV LEDs on Si were realized by a combination of a reduction in the number of cracks and of the threading dislocation density (TDD) of AlN templates by using the epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) method. The ELO-AlN templates were successfully coalesced on trench-patterned substrates, with the stripes running along the < 1-100 > direction of AlN. The density of cracks was greatly reduced in 4-mu m-thick ELO-AlN templates, because voids formed by the ELO process relaxed the tensile stress in the AlN layer. Furthermore, the AlN templates showed low-TDD. The full-width-at-half-maximum values of the (0002) and (10-12) X-ray rocking curves were 780 and 980 arcsec, respectively. DUV LEDs fabricated on these high-quality ELO-AlN/Si substrates showed single peak emission at 256-278 nm in electroluminescence measurements. It is expected that we will be able to realize low-cost DUV LEDs on Si substrates by using ELO-AlN templates.","Mino, Takuya; Hirayama, Hideki; Takano, Takayoshi; Tsubaki, Kenji; Sugiyama, Masakazu",2013.0,GALLIUM NITRIDE MATERIALS AND DEVICES VIII,10.1117/12.2002322,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2002322
Tilt Angle Optimization in Dynamic TDD mmWave Cellular Scenarios,"With the introduction of massive MIMO and directional transmissions, antenna configuration has arisen as a major factor influencing coverage and capacity in fifth generation mobile networks. In particular, mechanical tilting can yield performance advancements that cannot be achieved by purely electronic steering, due to the presence of grating lobes and antenna pattern attenuations. In this letter, the performance of mmWave cellular systems is evaluated in terms of SINR when an adjacent-channel node is interfering with an (UL) transmission. We examine a mobile scenario complete with dynamic (TDD) and highlight how the optimization of the antenna tilt angle can drastically improve the overall network performance. Antenna down-tilt can be properly optimized according to both the environment and the antenna settings, thus reducing the overall interference level. We propose a general methodology and discuss a number of important network considerations, towards an effective optimization of the tilt angle. Our evaluation makes it possible to determine the best tilting configuration to be used, according to the scenario considered.","Rebato, Mattia; Rose, Luca; Zorzi, Michele",2020.0,IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS,10.1109/LCOMM.2020.3008870,https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2020.3008870
"Exploring Taxi Demand Distribution of Comprehensive Land-Use Patterns Using Online Car-Hailing Data and Points of Interest in Chengdu, China","With the rapid advance of urbanization, land-use intensity is increasing, and various land-use forms gather to form comprehensive land-use patterns. Traffic demand shows variability and complexity under comprehensive land-use patterns. Accurate analysis of traffic demand in urban transportation is the key to active traffic control and road guidance. Researchers have widely studied the relationship between traffic demand and land-use patterns, while land-use intensity is ignored when classifying land-use patterns, and the traffic demand distribution in each land-use pattern is not studied specifically. Taxi is a flexible public mode in urban areas, and taxi demand is an important component in analyzing traffic demand and identifying traffic hotspots in cities. This paper explores taxi demand distribution of comprehensive land-use patterns using online car-hailing data and points of interest (POI) in Chengdu, China. The demand-driven traffic analysis zones are developed by clustering origin-destination points of online car-hailing services. Using POI data, comprehensive land-use patterns are classified with land-use forms and land-use intensity. The K-shape algorithm is adopted to extract the typical taxi demand distribution in each comprehensive land-use pattern. Finally, two indicators, total taxi demand (TTD) and taxi demand difference (TDD), are computed and further analyzed. Results show that taxi demand distribution is still differential even under the same land-use pattern. Three land-use patterns whose average hourly taxi demand reaches about 300 vehicles per square kilometer have the largest TTD and most uneven TDD. The findings can support traffic management, land-use combination, and land-use adjustment to avoid concentrated taxi demand and mismatched TDD.","Yu, Weijie; Wang, Wei; Hua, Xuedong; Wei, Xueyan",2021.0,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD,10.1177/03611981211015259,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981211015259

Pendeo-epitaxy of GaN on SOI nano-pillars: Freestanding and relaxed GaN platelets on silicon with a reduced dislocation density,"Nanopendeo-epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) is considered in this study as a way of producing freestanding GaN with reduced strain and threading dislocation density (TDD) for optoelectronic applications. The novelty of this work lies in the use of silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates patterned into nano-pillars down to the buried oxide (BOX).

Characterization of {11-22} GaN grown using two-step growth technique on shallowly etched r-plane patterned sapphire substrates,"Previously, we succeeded in growing flat semipolar (11 22) GaN layers on an r-plane patterned sapphire substrate (r-PSS). However, the GaN layers still contain a dislocation density of over 3 x 10(8)/cm(2) and stacking faults (SFs). To reduce such defects, we employed shallowly etched r-PSSs. The etching depths of the shallowly etched r-PSSs were from 100 to 500 nm, whereas that of a conventional r-PSS was 1 pm. As a result, we found that the threading dislocation density (TDD) decreases as the etching depth decreases. The TDD of the (11 221 GaN layer on r-PSS etched to a depth of 100 nm was 1.3 x 10(8)/cm(2). Moreover, the reduction of the SFs was observed by photoluminescence at cryogenic temperature. The reduction of the defects revealed the growth mechanism; the crystalline quality of)11 22) GaN on an r-PSS depends on the selective growth area of the sapphire sidewall. (C)2014 Elsevier RV.

"Gradient-Based Predictive Pulse Pattern Control of Medium-Voltage DrivesuPart I: Control, Concept, and Analysis","This article proposes a control and modulation strategy for medium-voltage (MV) drives that exhibits excellent steady-state and transient behavior. Specifically, optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) and direct model predictive control are employed so that the associated advantages of both, such as minimum stator current total demand distortion (TDD) and fast transients, respectively, are fully exploited. To do so, the current reference trajectory tracking and modulation problems are addressed in a coordinated manner in the form of a constrained optimization problem that utilizes the knowledge of the stator current evolution-as described by its gradient-within the prediction horizon. Solving this problem yields the optimal real-time modification of the offline-computed OPP, which guarantees that very low-and close to its theoretical minimum value-stator current TDD is produced at steady state, and very short settling times during transients. To highlight the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a variable speed drive system consisting of a three-level neutral point clamped inverter and an MV induction machine serves as a case study.","Begh, Mirza Abdul Waris; Karamanakos, Petros; Geyer, Tobias",2022.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS,10.1109/TPEL.2022.3190708,https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2022.3190708
Deletion of TerD-domain-encoding genes: effect on Streptomyces coelicolor development,"TerD-domain-encoding genes (tdd genes) are highly represented in the Streptomyces coelicolor genome. One of these, the tdd8 gene, was recently shown to have a crucial influence on growth, differentiation, and spore development of this filamentous bacterium. The investigation of the potential role of tdd genes has been extended here to tdd7 (SCO2367) and tdd13 (SCO4277). Both genes are highly expressed in bacteria grown in liquid-rich medium (tryptic soy broth). However, the deletion of these genes in S. coelicolor showed contrasting effects regarding developmental patterns, sporulation, and antibiotic production. Deletion of the tdd7 gene induced a reduction of growth in liquid medium, wrinkling of the mycelium on solid medium, and poor spore and actinorhodin production. On the other hand, deletion of the tdd13 gene did not significantly affect growth in liquid medium but induced a small colony phenotype on solid medium with abundant sporulation and overproduction of undecylprodigiosin. Although their exact functions remain undefined, the present data suggest a major involvement of TerD proteins in the proper development of S. coelicolor.","Sanssouci, Edith; Lerat, Sylvain; Daigle, Francois; Grondin, Gilles; Shareck, Francois; Beaulieu, Carole",2012.0,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,10.1139/w2012-101,https://doi.org/10.1139/w2012-101
Site-selective deposition of TiO2 thin films using self-assembled monolayers and their dielectric properties,"TiO2 thin films were grown on several kinds of SAMs (self-assembled monolayers) using TC (titanium tetrachloride), TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide) or TE (titanium tetraethoxide) as a starting material. We attempted to improve the feature edge acuity through controlling the reactivity by changing starting materials and surface functional groups of SAMs. The deposition of TiO2 from TC or TDD solution was promoted on the silanol group, and the deposition was suppressed on OTS (octadecyltrichloro-silane)-SAM. On the other hand, TiO2 was deposited from TE solution regardless of the type of a surface functional group in the whole area of patterned SAMs. The silanol group which has high hydrophilicity accelerated the growth of TiO2, but the OTS-SAM which has hydrophobicity suppressed the growth of TiO2. It is also clarified that the chlorine atom in starting material has high reactivity with silanol groups of SAMs. As-deposited thin films were amorphous with different compositions depending on the starting material and crystallized into anatase by annealing above similar to300degreesC. Current-voltage characteristics of a MOS device constructed from TiO2 thin film was evaluated.","Masuda, Y; Wang, DJ; Yonezawa, T; Koumoto, K",2002.0,"ASIAN CERAMIC SCIENCE FOR ELECTRONICS II AND ELECTROCERAMICS IN JAPAN V, PROCEEDINGS",10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.228-229.125,https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.228-229.125

Low threading dislocation density in GaN films grown on patterned sapphire substrates,"The growth process of three-dimensional growth mode (3D) switching to two-dimensional growth mode (2D) is investigated when GaN films are grown on cone-shaped patterned sapphire substrates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The growth condition of the 3D-2D growth process is optimized to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD). It is found that the condition of the 3D layer is critical. The 3D layer keeps growing under the conditions of low V/III ratio, low temperature, and high pressure until its thickness is comparable to the height of the cone-shaped patterns. Then the 3D layer surrounds the cone-shaped patterns and has inclined side facets and a top (0001) plane. In the following 2D-growth process, inclined side facets coalesce quickly and the interaction of TDs with the side facets causes the TDs to bend over. As a result, the TDD of GaN films can decrease to 1 x 10(8) cm(-2), giving full-width at half maximum values of 211 and 219 arcsec for (002) and (102) omega scans, respectively.",Liang Meng; Wang Guohong; Li Hongjian; Li Zhicong; Yao Ran; Wang Bing; Li Panpan; Li Jing; Yi Xiaoyan; Wang Junxi; Li Jinmin,2012.0,JOURNAL OF SEMICONDUCTORS,10.1088/1674-4926/33/11/113002,https://doi.org/10.1088/1674-4926/33/11/113002

Epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN on nano-cavity patterned sapphire substrates,"The epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition using a nano-cavity patterned sapphire substrate (NCPSS) was investigated. The NCPSS, with a hexagonal non-close-packed nano-cavity pattern on the sapphire substrate, was fabricated by polystyrene sphere coating and size reduction by reactive ion etching, followed by deposition of alumina and thermal oxidation. The coalescence of GaN on the NCPSS was achieved by the formation of relatively large GaN islands and enhanced lateral overgrowth of the GaN islands over several nano-cavity pattern areas. The threading dislocation density (TDD) measured by cathodoluminescence measurement was significantly reduced from 2.4x10(8) cm(-2) to 6.9x10(7) cm(-2) by using the NCPSS. A dislocation behavior that contributes to the reduction of TDD of the GaN layer was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the compressive stress in the GaN layer was reduced by 21% due to the embedded nano-cavities. In addition, the diffuse reflectance of GaN on the NCPSS was enhanced by 54%similar to 62%, which is attributed to the increased probability of light extraction through effective light scattering by nano-cavities.","Lee, Donghyun; Lee, Seungmin; Kim, Giwoong; Kim, Jongmyeong; Jang, Jeonghwan; Oh, Jehong; Moon, Daeyoung; Park, Yongjo; Yoon, Euijoon",2019.0,JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH,10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2018.11.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2018.11.001
Efficient Dislocation Prevention and Thermal Transport Network Constructed by CNT Films on PSS for GaN-Based UV LEDs,"We report the realization of a dislocation prevention and thermal transport network by adopting carbon nanotube (CNT) films on a commercially available patterned sapphire substrate (PSS), using which a high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) epilayer and a device with improved thermal performance are achieved at the same time. High fill factor CNT films with easy accessibility are lifted above the sapphire patterns and introduce a second selective area growth subsequent to the micron-scale selective area growth on PSS, leading to a further reduction in threading dislocation density (TDD) without involving any regrowth process. Under this dislocation prevention effect, the TDD of the GaN epilayer dropped to 3.5 x 10(7) cm(-2) consequently, which is 78% lower than that on PSS. A thermal transporting network of CNTs with high axial thermal conductivity is simultaneously established, contributing to the great improvement in the thermal performance of the near-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (LED) fabricated subsequently. As a result, an 89% increase in saturation light output power and a 55.5% enhancement in internal quantum efficiency were acquired. We thus believe that this convenient yet effective method will be a competitive solution for short-wavelength LED devices that require high efficiency and long lifetime.","Wang, Kun; Tian, Yucheng; Li, Mengda; Zhang, Huangshu; Chen, Zhizhong; Wei, Yang; Yu, Tongjun",2021.0,ACS APPLIED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS,10.1021/acsaelm.1c00736,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaelm.1c00736

Trustworthy Dynamic Data Awareness Model for Tracking in CPS,"With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), the interconnected devices and sensors in cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasing; these continuously exchange collected data for revealing helpful information about the overall system. In CPS-based monitoring applications, abnormal (including anomalies/outliers) values can lead to severe consequences for skewed judgments. The criteria for determining abnormal values may change over time, making it impossible to detect abnormal in real-time based on a training model or rely on traditional statistical methods to find abnormal values efficiently. When machine learning using, abnormal values in the data set are considered data errors or noise and excluded from analysis for the stability of the results. However, the identified abnormal values contain essential information in some cases, making correct navigation and identifying anomalies even more critical. This paper proposes a Trustworthy Dynamic Data Awareness (TDD-Awareness) algorithm that extracts the characteristics of continuous sensor data and accurately identifies abnormal values through the subsequent preprocessing process. The TDD-Awareness algorithm extracts the number of generated abnormally, the time of occurrence, and the characteristics and patterns needed to analyze the location of occurrence from the sensor data. The importance of abnormal values is determined by effectively exploring the relationship between abnormally to separate containing necessary information.","Kim, Svetlana; Kim, Subi; Yoon, YongIk",2022.0,HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES,10.22967/HCIS.2022.12.013,https://doi.org/10.22967/HCIS.2022.12.013
Seasonal Patterns in Daily Flight Distance and Space Use by Great Egrets (Ardea alba),"In an effort to quantify the value of wetland habitats, GPS technology was used to document the movement patterns of 16 Great Egrets (Ardea alba) in North America. Patterns in daily flight distances and utilization distributions (UD; estimates of area occupied on the ground) were documented throughout the annual cycle. Maximum Daily Displacement (MDD), the farthest distance occupied by a bird from colony/roost (central place) in 24 hr was greatest (4.3 +/- 0.1 km) during breeding season and lowest (3.3 +/- 0.1) during post-breeding season. As birds visited multiple foraging sites and made multiple round trips to central places, this Total Daily Distance (TDD) was also measured. It increased from a mean of about 12 km during the incubation phase to about 35 km at the time of fledging. Average TDD was greatest during breeding season (14.2 +/- 0.3 km) and lowest during winter (11.0 +/- 0.2 km). The utilization distribution increased from 128 (+/- 21.3) ha during breeding season to 179 (+/- 32.6) ha during winter. Birds that foraged at tidal sites used 183.3 (+/- 22.2) ha, twice as much area as birds that foraged strictly in freshwater sites (89.6 +/- 21.3 ha).","Brzorad, John N.; Allen, Michael C.; Jennings, Scott; Condeso, Emiko; Elbin, Susan; Kays, Roland; Lumpkin, David; Schweitzer, Sara; Tsipoura, Nellie; Maccarone, Alan D.",2021.0,WATERBIRDS,10.1675/063.044.0309,https://doi.org/10.1675/063.044.0309

Dislocation Reduction and Stress Relaxation of GaN and InGaN Multiple Quantum Wells with Improved Performance via Serpentine Channel Patterned Mask,"The existence of high threading dislocation density (TDD) in GaN-based epilayers is a long unsolved problem, which hinders further applications of defect-sensitive GaN-based devices. Multiple-modulation of epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) is used to achieve high-quality GaN template on a novel serpentine channel patterned sapphire substrate (SCPSS). The dislocation blocking brought by the serpentine channel patterned mask, coupled with repeated dislocation bending, can reduce the dislocation density to a yet-to-be-optimized level of similar to 2 X 10(5) to 2 X 10(6) cm(-2). About 80% area utilization rate of GaN with low TDD and stress relaxation is obtained. The periodical variations of dislocation density, optical properties and residual stress in GaN-based epilayers on SCPSS are analyzed. The quantum efficiency of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) on it can be increased by 52% compared with the conventional sapphire substrate. The reduced nonradiative recombination centers, the enhanced carrier localization, and the suppressed quantum confined Stark effect, are the main determinants of improved luminous performance in MQWs on SCPSS. This developed ELOG on serpentine shaped mask needs no interruption and regrowth, which can be a promising candidate for the heteroepitaxy of semipolar/nonpolar GaN and GaAs with high quality.","Ji, Qingbin; Li, Lei; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Jia; Liu, Peichi; Xie, Yahong; Yan, Tongxing; Yang, Wei; Chen, Weihua; Hu, Xiaodong",2016.0,ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,10.1021/acsami.6b07044,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b07044
On the Performance of Practical Ultra-Dense Networks: The Major and Minor Factors,"In this paper, we conduct performance evaluation for Ultra-Dense Networks (UDNs), and identify which modelling factors play major roles and minor roles. From our study, we draw the following conclusions. First, there are 3 factors/models that have a major impact on the performance of UDNs, and they should be considered when performing theoretical analyses: i) a multi-piece path loss model with line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions; ii) a non-zero antenna height difference between base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs); iii) a finite BS/UE density. Second, there are 4 factors/models that have a minor impact on the performance of UDNs, i.e., changing the results quantitatively but not qualitatively, and thus their incorporation into theoretical analyses is less urgent: i) a general multi-path fading model based on Rician fading; ii) a correlated shadow fading model; iii) a BS density dependent transmission power; iv) a deterministic BS/user density. Finally, there are 5 factors/models for future study: i) a BS vertical antenna pattern; ii) multi-antenna and/or multi-BS joint transmissions; iii) a proportional fair BS scheduler; iv) a non-uniform distribution of BSs; v) a dynamic time division duplex (TDD) or full duplex (FD) network. Our conclusions can guide researchers to down-select the assumptions in their theoretical analyses, so as to avoid unnecessarily complicated results, while still capturing the fundamentals of UDNs in a meaningful way.","Ding, Ming; Lopez-Perez, David",2017.0,"2017 15TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MODELING AND OPTIMIZATION IN MOBILE, AD HOC, AND WIRELESS NETWORKS (WIOPT)",,https://doi.org/

High-resolution and scalable printing of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS for printable electronics,"Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a primary candidate for the conductive material in printable electronics. Currently, lateral resolutions down to only 30 mu m have been demonstrated for roll-to-roll (R2R)-compatible PEDOT:PSS printing. However, increasing lateral resolution of the printing technique can increase the complexity/ability of printed devices. Topographical discontinuous dewetting (TDD) and liquid-bridge transfer (LBT) is employed as a high-resolution, scalable, R2R-compatible patterning technique to fabricate PEDOT:PSS patterns with down to 400 nm lateral resolution and high thicknesses. PEDOT:PSS ink dispersions were prepared with water/ethanol/cosolvent mixtures to enable the TDD process and ensure high conductivity. After transfer by LBT to target substrates, an impressive average conductivity of 20.5 S cm(-1) was measured for the transferred PEDOT:PSS patterns without any post-transfer conductivity-enhancing treatments. Post-transfer conductivity-enhancing treatments were applied that are device fabrication-compatible (acid-free) with very high conductivities up to similar to 2590 S cm(-1) and average conductivity of similar to 1190 S cm(-1) for PEDOT:PSS lines patterns fabricated with 4.3% dimethylformamide (DMF) cosolvent. Interestingly, DMF cosolvent in the PEDOT:PSS ink dispersion formed higher conductivity line patterns due to different drying dynamics. This work demonstrates a path to achieve high-resolution, scalable, R2R-compatible printing of PEDOT:PSS patterns while maintaining very high conductivities for future advanced printable electronic devices.","Corletto, Alexander; Shapter, Joseph G.",2021.0,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C,10.1039/d1tc03761g,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1tc03761g
Characteristics of epitaxial lateral overgrowth AlN templates on (111) Si substrates for AlGaN deep-UV LEDs fabricated on different direction stripe patterns,"We investigated the characteristics of epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) AlN templates fabricated on Si substrates which are applicable to AlGaN-based deep ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs). ELO-AlN layers were grown on stripe-patterned thin AlN seed-layer directly deposited on (111) Si substrates by using an 'NH3 pulsed-flow multi-layer (ML) growth' technique. A 4 mu m-thick ELO-AlN layer with stripe pattern along < 10-10 > direction of AlN can be coalesced successfully. We achieved marked reduction of crack and threading dislocation density (TDD) in the ELO AlN layers. In fact, the (10-12) full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray diffraction.-scan rocking curves (XRCs) of ELO-AlN template on Si substrate was reduced to be 980 arcsec. These results show that the combination of NH3 pulsed-flow ML growth and ELO method is effective to fabricate high-quality AlN templates on Si substrates. Moreover we fabricated 256-278 nm AlGaN quantum well (QW) DUV LEDs on the low TDD ELO-AlN templates on Si, and achieved single-peak operations under room temperature (RT) cw current injection. The low cost AlGaN based DUV LEDs on Si substrates is expected to be integrated with Si based electric devices on the same chips. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Diurnal Variation of Real-Life Insulin Sensitivity Factor Among Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Using Ultra-Long-Acting Basal Insulin Analogs,"BackgroundEstimation of insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) is essential for correction insulin doses calculation. This study aimed to assess real-life ISF among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogs and to detect factors associated with ISF among those patients. MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted at Sohag University Hospital, Egypt, and included 93 participants aged 6-18 years, diagnosed with T1DM for at least 1 year and using insulin glargine 300 Units/mL or insulin degludec 100 Units/mL as basal insulin. The ISF, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) and insulin doses were initially assessed then adjusted as required. The participants were regularly contacted throughout the follow-up period. Glycemic control parameters were assessed after 3 months. ResultsThe ISF showed diurnal variation with higher correction dose requirements for the morning than for the rest of the day (p < 0.001). This pattern of diurnal variation was found in participants with different pubertal stages and in participants using either type of ultra-long acting basal insulin analogs. There was no significant difference between the ISF calculated according to the 1800 rule [1800/Total daily insulin dose (TDD)] and the morning ISF (p = 0.25). The 1800 rule-calculated ISF was significantly lower than the actual ISF for the afternoon (p < 0.001) and the evening (p < 0.001). ISF at different times of the day were significantly correlated with age, body mass index, pubertal stage, diabetes duration, TDD, and ICR. Multiple regression analysis revealed that ICR was the most significant factor associated with ISF. Linear regression analysis revealed that the ISF (in mg/dL) for any time of the day could be estimated as 5.14 x ICR for the same time of the day (coefficient = 5.14, 95% confidence interval: 5.10-5.19, R-2 = 0.95, p < 0.001). ConclusionDiurnal variation of ISF that had to be considered for proper calculation of correction doses. This diurnal variation was found in children and adolescents with different pubertal stages. The 1800 rule was appropriate for the morning correction doses but not in the afternoon or the evening. The TDD and the ICR could be used for ISF estimation.","Hegab, Ahmed M.",2022.0,FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS,10.3389/fped.2022.854972,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.854972
Advantages of the moth-eye patterned sapphire substrate for the high performance nitride based LEDs,"We propose moth-eye patterned sapphire substrate (MPSS) as a solution to improve the light extraction efficiency and to reduce the production cost of LEDs. The MPSS samples' surfaces consisted of a triangular grid of about 375 nm high truncated cones with different pitches of 460 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, 700 nm and 800 nm. A commercially available patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) and a flat sapphire substrate (FSS) was also used in the experiments for comparison. According to the cathode luminescence observation, the GaN template on MPSS with a thickness of 3 mu m showed a threading dislocation density (TDD) of around 1.9 x 10(8) cm(-2). Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that many of the dislocations were bent and disappeared as loops formed in the vicinity of MPSS cones. On the other hand, PSS required a GaN template thicker than 5 mu m to achieve a level of TDD equal to MPSS. The LED on MPSS with a pitch of 600 nm showed the highest light output power among the evaluated LEDs as it was 1.89 times higher than that on FSS and 1.05 times higher than that on PSS.

Medial entorhinal cortex lesions produce delay-dependent disruptions in memory for elapsed time,"Our memory for time is a fundamental ability that we use to judge the duration of events, put our experiences into a temporal context, and decide when to initiate actions. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), with its direct projections to the hippocampus, has been proposed to be the key source of temporal information for hippocampal time cells. However, the behavioral relevance of such temporal firing patterns remains unclear, as most of the paradigms used for the study of temporal processing and time cells are either spatial tasks or tasks for which MEC function is not required. In this study, we asked whether the MEC is necessary for rats to perform a time duration discrimination task (TDD), in which rats were trained to discriminate between 10-s and 20-s delay intervals. After reaching a 90% performance criterion, the rats were assigned to receive an excitotoxic MEC-lesion or shamlesion surgery. We found that after recovering from surgery, rats with MEC lesions were impaired on the TDD task in comparison to rats with sham lesions, failing to return to criterion performance. Their impairment, however, was specific to the longer, 20-s delay trials. These results indicate that time processing is dependent on MEC neural computations only for delays that exceed 10 s, perhaps because long-term memory resources are needed to keep track of longer time intervals.","Vo, Annette; Tabrizi, Nina S.; Hunt, Thomas; Cayanan, Kayla; Chitale, Saee; Anderson, Lucy G.; Tenney, Sarah; White, Andre O.; Sabariego, Marta; Hales, Jena B.",2021.0,NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY,10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107507,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107507
Manipulation of microbial metabolite pattern .2.

High-Quality GaN Epilayers Achieved by Facet-Controlled Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth on Sputtered AIN/PSS Templates,"It is widely believed that the lack of high-quality GaN wafers severely hinders the progress in GaN-based devices, especially for defect-sensitive devices. Here, low-cost AIN buffer layers were sputtered on cone-shaped patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs) to obtain high-quality GaN epilayers. Without any mask or regrowth, facet-controlled epitaxial lateral overgrowth was realized by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The uniform coating of the sputtered AIN buffer layer and the optimized multiple modulation guaranteed high growth selectivity and uniformity of the GaN epilayer. As a result, an extremely smooth surface was achieved with an average roughness of 0.17 nm over 3 X 3 mu m(2). It was found that the sputtered AIN buffer layer could significantly suppress dislocations on the cones. Moreover, the optimized three-dimensional growth process could effectively promote dislocation bending. Therefore, the threading dislocation density (TDD) of the GaN epilayer was reduced to 4.6 x 10(7) cm(-2), which is about an order of magnitude lower than the case of two-step GaN on the PSS. In addition, contamination and crack in the light-emitting diode fabricated on the obtained GaN were also effectively suppressed by using the sputtered AIN buffer layer. All of these advantages led to a high output power of 116 mW at 500 mA with an emission wavelength of 375 nm. This simple, yet effective growth technique is believed to have great application prospects in high-performance TDD-sensitive optoelectronic and electronic devices.","He, Chenguang; Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Kang; He, Longfei; Wu, Hualong; Liu, Ningyang; Zhang, Shan; Liu, Xiaoyan; Chen, Zhitao",2017.0,ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES,10.1021/acsami.7b14801,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b14801
Innovative design of hollow polymeric microneedles for transdermal drug delivery,"Hypodermic injections give the best results in terms of drug administration efficiency, but benefit from a negative image among patients due to the fear of pain linked to needles. Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) has thus been greatly developed in the past ten years in order to be able to by-pass the skin protective layers in a minimally invasive way. With the advent of micro electro mechanical systems, opportunities have appeared, particularly in the area of microneedles. In this paper we present a new design of hollow polymeric microneedles aimed at being used for TDD by allowing injection of a liquid in the non-innerve part of the dermis. The design has been studied in order to be able to manufacture these microneedles arrays using techniques that may be applicable to industrial production at low cost. The envisioned microfabrication processes and their stacking are presented which involve injection micromolding and excimer laser ablation. Microneedles are also numerically characterized in terms of mechanics and microfluidics showing that the design also involves interesting features in terms of needles resistance and microfluidic. Due to the innovative double-molding technique, the micro-needles are indeed emptied leaving a cavity. An outlet channel on the side of the needle allows fluid flowing out of the needles. The characteristics of this outlet channel contribute to flow homogenization when several needles are placed in an array pattern. This microneedle design thus combines interesting characteristics in terms of ease of fabrication at large scale, mechanical resistance and fluid dynamics.","Lhernould, Marion Sausse; Delchambre, A.",2011.0,MICROSYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES-MICRO-AND NANOSYSTEMS-INFORMATION STORAGE AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS,10.1007/s00542-011-1355-2,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00542-011-1355-2
Validation of the Concept of a Common Typical Time of Disease Duration for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Using the Fisher Information Processing of Tumor Imaging Results Combined With Network Phenotyping Strategy Quantification of Individual Patient Clinical Profile Patterns,"A primary goal of current clinical cancer research is the identification of prognostic tumor subtypes. It is increasingly dear that tumor growth depends on both internal tumor factors, and factors that are external to the tumor, such as microenvironment. We recently showed that parameter values alone are less important than the patterns of all patient parameters together for the identification of prognostic subtypes and have identified a network phenotyping strategy method to quantitatively describe the dependency of the tumor on the environment, to characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtypes. We have also shown that information about tumor mass together with patterns of other prognostic factors is related to survival. We now use a different patient cohort to validate this prognostic approach. A main finding is our identification of a common time of total disease duration (MD) for every HCC patient. Clinical prognosis at the time of baseline patient evaluation is then calculable as the difference between TDD and the time from disease onset to diagnosis (T-onset). We show that the total pattern of all parameter values and the differences in the relationships between this pattern and a reference pattern that, together with the tumor mass, best reflects the patient's prognosis at baseline. Our approach led us to identify 15 different composite HCC subtypes. Our results highlight the nearly identical TDD in all patients, which must therefore be a characteristic of the HCC disease, as opposed to the variable quantity of T-onset, which is impacted by multiple macro- and micro-environmental factors.

Kalman Smoothing for Irregular Pilot Patterns; A Case Study for Predictor Antennas in TDD Systems,"For future large-scale multi-antenna systems, channel orthogonal downlink pilots are not feasible due to extensive overhead requirements. Instead, channel reciprocity can be utilized in time division duplex (TDD) systems so that the downlink channel estimates can be based on pilots transmitted during the uplink. User mobility affects the reciprocity and makes the channel state information outdated for high velocities and/or long downlink subframe durations. Channel extrapolation, e.g. through Kalman prediction, can reduce the problem but is also limited by high velocities and long downlink subframes. An alternative solution has been proposed where channel predictions are made with the help of an extra antenna, e.g. on the roof of a car, so called predictor antenna, with the primary objective to measure the channel at a position that is later encountered by the rearward antenna(s). The predictor antenna is not directly limited by high velocities and allows the channel in the downlinks to be interpolated rather than extrapolated. One remaining challenge here is to obtain a good interpolation of the uplink channel estimate, since a sequence of uplink reference signals (pilots) will be interrupted by downlink subframes. We here evaluate a Kalman smoothing estimate of the downlink channels and compare it to a cubic spline interpolation. These results are also compared to results where uplink channels are estimated through Kalman filters and predictors. Results are based on measured channels and show that with Kalman smoothing, predictor antennas can enable accurate channel estimates for a longer downlink period at vehicular velocities. The gaps in the uplink pilot stream, due to downlink subframes, can have durations that correspond to a vehicle movement of up to 0.75 carrier wavelengths in space, for Rayleigh-like non-line-of-sight fading.","Apelfrojd, Rikke; Bjorsell, Joachim; Sternad, Mikael; Dinh-Thuy Phan-Huy",2018.0,"2018 IEEE 29TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERSONAL, INDOOR AND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS (PIMRC)",,https://doi.org/
Antenna Array Diversity Evaluation Under Multipath Environments With Digital Beamforming,"This work proposes a methodology for evaluating the antenna array diversity and resultant radiation pattern from digitally-processed-based beamforming systems. Our approach enables to interpret the advanced antenna systems (AAS) coverage and massive multiple-input multiple output (mMIMO) spatial resolution, by the inspection of the array resultant multiple beams. Particularly, the impact on the mMIMO spatial resolution is conducted as a function of the channel correlation, by means of an exclusively radiofrequency (RF) approach, with the advantage of not considering the system-level features, and using a new figure of merit ( $\Lambda $ factor). The new figure of merit enables to evaluate the antenna array diversity from two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) beamforming, by computing the number of lobes with gain higher than a unique element. In the 3D case, the figure of merit is based on a differential calculation, which enables performing an infinitesimal counting of lobes per antenna element beamwidth. Such parameter is initially applied to a theoretical dipole-based array, with the purpose of quantifying the created multiple beams by the overlapped radiation patterns from mMIMO systems. Furthermore, the $\Lambda $ factor is exploited for analyzing the performance of a 64-element and dual-polarized SICL-based slot antenna array and a 64-element dipole-based antenna prototypes, both previously developed by our research group. Finally, it is demonstrated that the $\Lambda $ factor increases as diversity increases and dipole-based antenna array could be used as an upper limit, attaining 11.46 lobes/rad","Filgueiras, Hugo Rodrigues Dias; Brandao, Tiago Henrique; Pereira, Luiz Augusto Melo; Sodre Junior, Arismar Cerqueira Sodre",2023.0,IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION,10.1109/OJAP.2023.3252047,https://doi.org/10.1109/OJAP.2023.3252047

Shifting pilot locations in time is an effective way to obtain better channel estimation and therefore reduce inter-cell interference. We study the method further, and propose a low-complexity time shifted pilot allocation algorithm performing joint cell and user allocation. We show that the algorithm achieves a coordination gain over the original frequency-reuse-like pattern in terms of spectrum efficiency, and greatly reduces computational complexity compared with the exhaustive method used to obtain the optimal solution.","Wei, Te; Feng, Wei; Shi, Rui; Ge, Ning; Lu, Jianhua",2015.0,2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & SIGNAL PROCESSING (WCSP),10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341265,https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSP.2015.7341265

We present a novel process to realize selective deposition through heterogeneous nucleation and generate high-resolution micropatterns of TiO2 thin films from a gaseous phase.

DYNAMIC TRAVELING ROUTE PLANNING METHOD FOR INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION USING INCREMENTAL LEARNING-BASED HYBRID DEEP LEARNING PREDICTION MODEL WITH FINE-TUNING,"Predicting the most favorable traveling routes for Vehicles plays an influential role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Shortest Traveling Routes with high congestion grievously affect the driving comfort level of VANET users in populated cities. As a result, increase in journey time and traveling cost. Predicting the most favorable traveling routes with less congestion is imperative to minimize the driving inconveniences. A major downside of existing traveling route prediction models is to continuously learn the real-time road congestion data with static benchmarking datasets. However, learning the new information with already learned data is a cumbersome task. The main idea of this paper is to utilize incremental learning on the Hybrid Learning-based traffic Congestion and Timing Prediction (HL-CTP) to select realistic, congestion-free, and shortest traveling routes for the vehicles. The proposed HL-CTP model is decomposed into three steps: dataset construction, incremental and hybrid prediction model, and route selection. Firstly, the HL-CTP constructs a novel Traffic and Timing Dataset (TTD) using historical traffic congestion information. The incremental learning method updates the novel real-time data continuously with the TDD during prediction to optimize the performance efficiency of the hybrid prediction model closer to real-time. Secondly, the hybrid prediction model with various deep learning models performs better by taking the route prediction decision based on the best sub-predictor results. Finally, the HL-CTP selects the most favorable vehicle routes selected using traffic congestion, timing, and uncertain environmental information and enhances the comfort level of VANET users. In the simulation, the proposed HL-CTP demonstrates superior performance in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).","Kamble, Shridevi Jeevan; Kounte, Manjunath R.",2022.0,TRANSPORT AND TELECOMMUNICATION JOURNAL,10.2478/ttj-2022-0024,https://doi.org/10.2478/ttj-2022-0024
Practical methods for constructing suffix trees,"Sequence datasets are ubiquitous in modern life-science applications, and querying sequences is a common and critical operation in many of these applications. The suffix tree is a versatile data structure that can be used to evaluate a wide variety of queries on sequence datasets, including evaluating exact and approximate string matches, and finding repeat patterns. However, methods for constructing suffix trees are often very time-consuming, especially for suffix trees that are large and do not fit in the available main memory. Even when the suffix tree fits in memory, it turns out that the processor cache behavior of theoretically optimal suffix tree construction methods is poor, resulting in poor performance. Currently, there are a large number of algorithms for constructing suffix trees, but the practical tradeoffs in using these algorithms for different scenarios are not well characterized. In this paper, we explore suffix tree construction algorithms over a wide spectrum of data sources and sizes. First, we show that on modern processors, a cache-efficient algorithm with O(n(2)p) worst-case complexity outperforms popular linear time algorithms like Ukkonen and McCreight, even for in-memory construction. For larger datasets, the disk I/O requirement quickly becomes the bottleneck in each algorithm's performance. To address this problem, we describe two approaches. First, we present a buffer management strategy for the O(n(2)) algorithm. The resulting new algorithm, which we call Top Down Disk-based (TDD), scales to sizes much larger than have been previously described in literature. This approach far outperforms the best known disk-based construction methods. Second, we present a new disk-based suffix tree construction algorithm that is based on a sort-merge paradigm, and show that for constructing very large suffix trees with very little resources, this algorithm is more efficient than TDD.","Tian, YY; Tata, S; Hankins, RA; Patel, JM",2005.0,VLDB JOURNAL,10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8
Towards Efficient Decoding of Multiple Classes of Motor Imagery Limb Movements Based on EEG Spectral and Time Domain Descriptors,"To control multiple degrees of freedom (MDoF) upper limb prostheses, pattern recognition (PR) of electromyogram (EMG) signals has been successfully applied. This technique requires amputees to provide sufficient EMG signals to decode their limb movement intentions (LMIs). However, amputees with neuromuscular disorder/high level amputation often cannot provide sufficient EMG control signals, and thus the applicability of the EMG-PR technique is limited especially to this category of amputees. As an alternative approach, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals recorded non-invasively from the brain have been utilized to decode the LMIs of humans. However, most of the existing EEG based limb movement decoding methods primarily focus on identifying limited classes of upper limb movements. In addition, investigation on EEG feature extraction methods for the decoding of multiple classes of LMIs has rarely been considered. Therefore, 32 EEG feature extraction methods (including 12 spectral domain descriptors (SDDs) and 20 time domain descriptors (TDDs)) were used to decode multiple classes of motor imagery patterns associated with different upper limb movements based on 64-channel EEG recordings. From the obtained experimental results, the best individual TDD achieved an accuracy of 67.05 +/- 3.12% as against 87.03 +/- 2.26% for the best SDD. By applying a linear feature combination technique, an optimal set of combined TDDs recorded an average accuracy of 90.68% while that of the SDDs achieved an accuracy of 99.55% which were significantly higher than those of the individual TDD and SDD at p < 0.05. Our findings suggest that optimal feature set combination would yield a relatively high decoding accuracy that may improve the clinical robustness of MDoF neuroprosthesis.","Samuel, Oluwarotimi Williams; Geng, Yanjuan; Li, Xiangxin; Li, Guanglin",2017.0,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,10.1007/s10916-017-0843-z,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-017-0843-z
Strain Modulation of Selectively and/or Globally Grown Ge Layers,"This article presents a novel method to grow a high-quality compressive-strain Ge epilayer on Si using the selective epitaxial growth (SEG) applying the RPCVD technique. The procedures are composed of a global growth of Ge layer on Si followed by a planarization using CMP as initial process steps. The growth parameters of the Ge layer were carefully optimized and after cycle-annealing treatments, the threading dislocation density (TDD) was reduced to 3 x 10(7) cm(-2). As a result of this process, a tensile strain of 0.25% was induced, whereas the RMS value was as low as 0.81 nm. Later, these substrates were covered by an oxide layer and patterned to create trenches for selective epitaxy growth (SEG) of the Ge layer. In these structures, a type of compressive strain was formed in the SEG Ge top layer. The strain amount was -0.34%; meanwhile, the TDD and RMS surface roughness were 2 x 10(6) cm(-2) and 0.68 nm, respectively. HRXRD and TEM results also verified the existence of compressive strain in selectively grown Ge layer. In contrast to the tensile strained Ge layer (globally grown), enhanced PL intensity by a factor of more than 2 is partially due to the improved material quality. The significantly high PL intensity is attributed to the improved crystalline quality of the selectively grown Ge layer. The change in direct bandgap energy of PL was observed, owing to the compressive strain introduced. Hall measurement shows that a selectively grown Ge layer possesses room temperature hole mobility up to 375 cm(2)/Vs, which is approximately 3 times larger than that of the Ge (132 cm(2)/Vs). Our work offers fundamental guidance for the growth of high-quality and compressive strain Ge epilayer on Si for future Ge-based optoelectronics integration applications.","Du, Yong; Wang, Guilei; Miao, Yuanhao; Xu, Buqing; Li, Ben; Kong, Zhenzhen; Yu, Jiahan; Zhao, Xuewei; Lin, Hongxiao; Su, Jiale; Han, Jianghao; Liu, Jinbiao; Dong, Yan; Wang, Wenwu; Radamson, Henry H.",2021.0,NANOMATERIALS,10.3390/nano11061421,https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11061421
Queueing Stability and CSI Probing of a TDD Wireless Network With Interference Alignment,"This paper characterizes the performance in terms of queueing stability of a network composed of multiple MIMO transmitter-receiver pairs taking into account the dynamic traffic pattern and the probing/feedback cost. We adopt a centralized scheduling scheme that selects a number of active pairs in each time-slot. We consider that the transmitters apply interference alignment (IA) technique if two or more pairs are active, whereas in the special case where one pair is active point-to-point MIMO singular value decomposition (SVD) is used. We consider a time-division duplex (TDD) system where transmitters acquire their channel state information (CSI) by decoding the pilot sequences sent by the receivers. Since global CSI knowledge is required for IA, the transmitters have also to exchange their estimated CSIs over a backhaul of limited capacity (i.e. imperfect case). Under this setting, we characterize in this paper the stability region of the system under both the imperfect and perfect (i.e. unlimited backhaul) cases, then we examine the gap between these two resulting regions. Further, under each case we provide a centralized probing policy that achieves the max stability region. These stability regions and scheduling policies are given for the symmetric system, where all the path loss coefficients are equal to each other, as well as for the general system. For the symmetric system, we provide the conditions under which IA yields a queueing stability gain compared to SVD. Under the general system, the adopted scheduling policy is of a high computational complexity for moderate numbers of pairs, consequently we propose an approximate policy that has a reduced complexity but that achieves only a fraction of the system stability region. A characterization of this fraction is provided.","Deghel, Matha; Assaad, Mohamad; Debbah, Merouane; Ephremides, Anthony",2018.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY,10.1109/TIT.2017.2748518,https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2748518

Coordinated Resource Allocation in Centralized Radio Access Networks with Dynamic Downlink/Uplink Reconfiguration,"We propose and evaluate a novel coordinated resource allocation scheme in T ime Division Duplex (TDD) systems where the downlink/uplink (DL/UL) resources are allocated dynamically for asymmetric traffic adaptation. To eliminate the cross-subframe co-channel interference (CCI), we first formulate the dynamic reconfiguration problem as the cooperative control that operates on disjoint cell clusters. With this setup, the DL/UL configurations are no longer determined with respect to an individual cell, but are chosen in form of the cluster-specific configuration patterns (CPs) with optimized performance metrics. Additionally, a novel CCI cancelation (CCIC) method, termed cross-subframe coordinated schedulinglbeamforming (CCS/CCB) is incorporated in the proposed reconfiguration approach. By jointly designing and optimizing the beamforming vectors and the traffic scheduling, the residual intra-cluster CCI can be mitigated.","Zhu, Dalin; Lei, Ming; Goldsmith, Andrea",2013.0,2013 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM),,https://doi.org/

In this paper, we propose an antenna grouping based feedback reduction technique for FDD-based massive MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm, dubbed antenna group beamforming (AGB), groups antenna elements using pre-designed patterns. The proposed method introduces the concept of using a header of overall feedback resources to select a suitable group pattern and the payload to quantize the effective channel vector. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves significant feedback overhead reduction over conventional approach.","Lee, Byungju; Choi, Junil; Seol, Ji-yun; Love, David J.; Shim, Byonghyo",2014.0,2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC),,https://doi.org/
Synchronizability of general periodic pattern signals,"In this paper(1) an optimum and sub-optimum maximum likelihood (ML) rule for joint frame and carrier frequency offset estimation are derived, which rely on the transmission of a periodic pattern signal with an arbitrary number of periods and period length, embedded in the random data signal of a single user. Ad-hoc modification of the ML rule yields a robust metric for pattern search in a multi-user signal in a time division multiple access and time division duplex (TDMA/TDD) system, and a receiver with automatic gain control keeping constant average signal power at the synchronizer input. The mean, variance and Cramer-Rao Bound of the frequency offset estimate as well as the mean and variance of the frame estimate are theoretically evaluated and verified by simulation. The presented material proposes a unified framework for synchronization by periodic pattern signals and provides some new results, which are compared to known references.","Stantchev, B; Fettweis, G",2000.0,"ICC 2000: IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-3: GLOBAL CONVERGENCE THROUGH COMMUNICATIONS",,https://doi.org/
"Dual-band Compact Monopole Antenna for Bluetooth, LTE, WLAN and Ultra-wideband Applications","This paper presents a dual-band compact monopole antenna for Bluetooth, LTE, WLAN and ultra-wideband applications. The proposed dual-band monopole antenna system operates over 2.3-2.9 GHz (TDD-LTE/Bluetooth) and 4.2-10.6 GHz which covers WLAN and upper UWB frequency bands. The antenna is designed using 1.6 mm FR-4 dielectric substrate having a dielectric constant of 4.4 and loss tangent of 0.02. S-l1 < 10 dB over 2.3-2.9 GHz and 4.2-10.6 GHz is obtained. The antenna offers stable gain with gain variation < 3 dB over the desired bands and has nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns. The antenna has nearly constant group delay characteristic and has good transient response in the working band. The proposed antenna is fabricated and tested. The measured results agree with simulation results.","Kohirkar, Ashwini; Jadhav, Vidya; Gupta, Rajiv Kumar",2016.0,2016 ASIA-PACIFIC MICROWAVE CONFERENCE (APMC2016),,https://doi.org/
Selective deposition and micropatterning of titanium dioxide thin film on self-assembled monolayers,"We succeeded in fabricating micropatterns of titanium dioxide thin films on SAMs (self-assembled monolayers). SAMs of OTS (octadecyltrichloro-silane) were formed on Si wafers, and were modified by UV irradiation using a photomask to generate methyl/silanol-pattem. They were used as templates to deposit titanium dioxide thin films by the use of TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide). Amorphous films with approximate compositions Ti/O/CI/C = 1:2.2:0.17:0.37 were selectively deposited on silanol regions. Line width variation of the pattern of an as-deposited film was improved to be well below the electronics design rule, 5%. Annealing the films at high temperatures (400-600 degreesC) gave rise to an anatase phase, while the resolution of a micropattern remained unchanged. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Improved turbo-coded UMTS systems with Unequal Error Protection of compressed video sequences transmitted over frequency-selective channels,A novel Unequal Error Protection technique is presented for the transmission of H263 compressed and turbo-coded video sequences over it UMTS/TDD wireless system. The overall redundancy added to the compressed stream is non-uniformly distributed between the succeeding video frames in order to minimize the mean distortion over the transmitted sequence. The repartition of the redundancy on the video stream is optimized using an analytical approach which aims to alleviate the error propagation along the sequence. Different puncturing patterns of the rate 1/3 turbo-coder were considered in our simulations. Experimental results show that the gain (in terms of the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) over the classical Equal Error Protection scheme can reach 1.5 dB without any increase in the transmission rate or the receiver complexity.,"Marx, F; Farah, J",2004.0,"2004 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-7",10.1109/ICC.2004.1313100,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2004.1313100
Characterization and comparison of Re-Du-Ning aerosol particles generated by different jet nebulizers,"Inhalation therapy is the first-line therapy for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Re-Du-Ning inhalation solution (RIS) is an aerosol derivative from the Re-Du-Ning injection and has been clinically used to treat respiratory diseases like pneumonia for more than twenty years in China. However, the aerosolization and inhalation performances of RIS using different nebulizers have not been characterized, which may affect the therapeutic effects of RIS on respiratory diseases. We investigated the inhalation performances of RIS using five different nebulizers utilizing Spraytec, breath simulator of BRS 2000 and NGI techniques. We tested 5 different types of jet nebulizer, using RIS and an adult breathing pattern, to determine the difference in aerosol delivery over time. The particle size distribution of RIS was monitored by a Spraytec laser particle sizer. Fine particle fraction (FPF) and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) for RIS were measured using NGI. Aerosol deposited on the filter was analysed using HPLC. Nebulization time was much longer for the Pari Boy SX (red) nebulizer than for the other nebulizers, with the minimum delivery rate (DR) and the maximum total delivered dose (TDD) and total exhalation dose (TED). Nebulization time for Pari Boy SX (blue) was the lowest, with the highest DR and the lowest TDD and TED. Furthermore, the aerodynamic particle size of RIS was much larger for the Pari blue and Pari LC Plus than other nebulizers. Pari red produced the smallest aerodynamic particle size of RIS in these five nebulizers. In addition, a good linear relationship was found between MMAD and D-50 in these five nebulizers. The results demonstrated that Pari Boy SX (red) delivered most slowly and produced the smallest aerodynamic particle size of the RIS aerosols, which may be applied to manage lower respiratory diseases. Moreover, Pari LC Plus and Pari Boy SX (blue) emitted quickly and generated larger aerodynamic particle size of RIS aerosols, which could be used to treat upper respiratory diseases. A good linear relationship between MMAD and D-50 showed Spraytec could be a reliable technique for the development, evaluation and quality control of aerosol particles of inhalation solution preparations.","Zhang, Yi; Cheng, Brian Chi-Yan; Li, Cui; Tao, Yonghua; Yu, Chanjuan; Liu, Xinyue; Gao, Xiaoyan; Luo, Gan",2019.0,RSC ADVANCES,10.1039/c9ra06177k,https://doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06177k
Crystalline quality improvement of GaN coalesced using nano-PSS with void-embedded nanostructure by MOVPE,"The nanoscale patterned sapphire substrates (NPSS) were prepared combining nanoimprint lithography and dry/wet etching technology. The NPSS was patterned with 300 nm diameter, 330 nm depth, 550 nm periodicity hexagonal close packed pillars. Coalescence of GaN has been achieved on the NPSS using MOVPE. The growth mode and conditions were discussed in detail, which was different from that of GaN epitaxial on planar sapphire. The AFM images showed the GaN on NPSS had a smoother surface, and the XRD results showed that the crystal quality had been improved by the NPSS. The threading dislocation density (TDD) suppression was observed in transmission electron microscopy. Depth-resolved CL measurements were used to quantify the redshift in terms of bandgap renormalization and strain effects. It was supposed that the compressive stress in the GaN layers was changed gradually towards the growth surface. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

High Quality Epitaxial Germanium on Si (100) for low - cost III-V Solar-Cells,"Integration of high quality germanium on silicon is prerequisite for fabricating high efficiency low-cost III-V solar cells on silicon. In this work, we present a method of monolithic integration of epitaxial germanium on crystalline silicon wafers where a single-step anneal in hydrogen ambient is used to recrystallize PECVD-deposited amorphous germanium into crystalline germanium. The re-crystallization progresses via liquid phase epitaxy by heating the germanium layer in inert ambient to just above its melting temperature of 937 degrees C. On cooling, the Ge layer gets oriented by the underlying Si (100) wafer, yielding an epitaxial Ge film on Si. SEM show that the films are continuous and void free. XRD pattern indicates highly oriented films. Symmetric Rocking curve measurements showed a thickness dependence with 1 mu m thick film showing the lowest threading dislocation density (TDD) of the order of 108cm(-2). AFM measurements indicate surface measurements similar to 10 nm. Quality of epitaxy depends on thickness of film.","Chaurasia, Saloni; Raghavan, Srinivasan; Avasthi, Sushobhan",2017.0,2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC),,https://doi.org/
HVPE growth of thick AlN on trench-patterned substrate,"We have fabricated low threading dislocation density (TDD) and crack-free thick AlN films on trench-patterned AlN templates for application to deep-ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by employing an epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) process. Using AlN templates with various stripe structures formed along the < 10-10 > direction, We systematically investigated mechanism of void structure formed by the ELO process. It was found that the height of void-tops was proportional to the groove width and the growth rate ratio of vertical to lateral. And, the height of void-bottoms was proportional to the parameter defined as the square of groove-width divided by the groove-depth. Furthermore, the growth rate ratio of vertical to lateral lowered with increasing growth temperature, and heightened with decreasing V/III ratio. [GRAPHICS] (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Real-world data reveal unmet clinical needs in insulin treatment in Asian people with type 2 diabetes: the Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register,"Aims To explore the pattern of insulin use and glycaemic control in Asian people with type 2 diabetes, stratified by gender, young-onset diabetes (YOD; diagnosed before age 40 years), and diabetic kidney disease (DKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73m(2)). Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 97 852 patients from 11 Asian countries/regions (2007-2017) included in the prospective Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation (JADE) Register. Results Among 18 998 insulin users (47% women, mean +/- SD age 59.2 +/- 11.7 years, diabetes duration 13.2 +/- 8.3 years, glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 72 +/- 21.4 mmol/mol [8.74 +/- 1.95%], median total daily insulin dose [TDD] 0.27-0.82 units/kg), 25% and 29.5% had YOD and DKD, respectively. Premixed (44%) and basal-only (42%) insulin were the most common regimens. Despite being more commonly treated with these two regimens with higher insulin dosages, patients with YOD had worse HbA1c levels than their late-onset peers (73 +/- 20.5 vs. 71 +/- 21.2 mmol/mol [8.82 +/- 1.87% vs. 8.66 +/- 1.94%]; P < 0.001). Fewer women than men attained an HbA1c level < 53 mmol/mol (7%; 15.7% vs 17.1%; P = 0.018). Adjusting for age, diabetes duration, TDD, HbA1c, eGFR, and use of oral glucose-lowering drugs at baseline, the odds of self-reported hypoglycaemia were higher in women (vs. men: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.28) and in patients with DKD treated with a premixed regimen (1.81 [95% CI 1.54-2.13] vs. 1.34 [95% CI 1.16-1.54] in non-DKD; P-interaction < 0.001). Compared to basal-only regimens, premixed and basal-bolus regimens had similar HbA1c reductions but were independently associated with increased odds of hypoglycaemia (1.65 [95% CI 1.45-1.88] and 1.88 [95% CI 1.58-2.23], respectively). Conclusions In this Asian population, there were varying patterns of insulin regimens with suboptimal glycaemic control, despite relatively high TDDs, which were influenced by gender, DKD, and YOD status.","Kong, Alice P.

Down-link performance of interference canceller combining path pre-selecting adaptive array and cascaded equalizer,"In order to improve the capacity and quality of high-speed mobile communication systems, we proposed an interference canceller that combines a path pre-selecting adaptive array and a cascaded equalizer [1]. The role of the adaptive array in the canceller is to reduce co-channel interference (CCI) and long-delayed inter-symbol interference (ISI). Thus, the cascaded equalizer needs less complexity. In this paper, we propose to apply the canceller to the base station (BS) of a TDMA/TDD system and to reuse the receiving beam pattern in transmission. Then, in the down-link, the BS emits only the desired signal and short-delayed ISI for a desired mobile station (MS). As a result, with a simple equalizer in the MS, we can get a sufficient path diversity gain also in the down-link. The average bit error rate (BER) performance of the system in a Rayleigh fading channel is calculated by computer simulation. The results show that a sufficient path diversity gain is obtained in the down-link as well as in the up-link.","Doi, Y; Ohgane, T; Karasawa, Y",1998.0,"48TH IEEE VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3",,https://doi.org/
Semantic similarity in geographic information retrieval for decision making,"People use the similarity to store and retrieve information comparing new situations with similar experiences occurred in the past also for learning and concept formation. While equality comparison between two objects can be calculated by computers quickly and accurately similarity is a complex problem to calculate. Even still difficult to determine similarity plays a fundamental role in many applications such as decision-making systems, data mining and pattern recognition. The same applies to the spatial similarity in the processes of recovery and integration of spatial information. In this paper a methodology based on the semantic processing of geospatial information is proposed. It consists of five stages: conceptualization, synthesis, application processing, retrieval and management. It uses ontology of New Genetic Soil Classification of Cuba and applying the measure of semantic similarity Conceptual Distance (DIS-C) combined with an implementation model TDD (Topology-Direction-Distance) to restore and support the user in the selection of spatial scenes.

Outer loop power control using channel-adaptive processing for 3G WCDMA,"In power control systems for wide-band code division multiple-access (WCDMA), the outer loop power control (OLPC) algorithm initially sets a target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) based on the required target Block Error Rate (BLER), assuming a particular channel condition. A mismatch between the BLER and the target SIR usually results since the actual and assumed channel conditions are rarely the same. This mismatch tends to be especially large at very low BLERs. The OLPC depends on cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) and often takes a long time to converge to the required target SIR for low target BLERs. In this paper a channel-adaptive algorithm is presented that controls the target SIR for downlink transmission in WCDMA TDD. The proposed algorithm characterizes the multipalh channel profile using predefined multipath channel patterns and compensates for the channel/mapping errors. Link level simulations are conducted in various channel conditions defined by 3GPP and the ITU. The comparison in performance between the channel-adaptive algorithm and the generic jump algorithm is illustrated and conclusions are drawn.","Koo, CS; Shin, SH; DiFazio, RA; Grieco, D; Zeira, A",2003.0,"57TH IEEE VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, VTC 2003-SPRING, VOLS 1-4, PROCEEDINGS",,https://doi.org/
Improved Single-Stream Beamforming Algorithm in TD-LTE System,"Beamforming (BF) is a pre-signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. It produces directional BF by adjusting the weighted coefficient of each array element to obtain obvious array gain. At present, the most common BF algorithms are eigen-based Beamfirming (EBB) algorithm and grid of beam (GOB) algorithm, but these two algorithms still have some defects. Therefore, this paper thoroughly illustrates EBB and GOB algorithms and respectively presents the corresponding improvements. On the one hand, this article proposes a modified EBB algorithm which only adaptively changes phase pattern to reduce the impact on the amplitude of the original signal, thus decreases the power loss. On the other hand, this paper puts forward an improved GOB algorithm which adds the correlation factors of the antennas with different polarization at the same physical position to increase BF gain. The performances of improved and original BF algorithms are simulated in a platform of TD-LTE. The simulation result shows that BLER performances of two enhanced BF algorithms are better than corresponding traditional algorithms.","Liu, Yanan; Liu, Hao; Jia, Tianxiang; Wang, Teng",2014.0,2014 IEEE 17th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE),10.1109/CSE.2014.95,https://doi.org/10.1109/CSE.2014.95
A traffic aware joint CQI feedback and scheduling scheme for multichannel downlink systems in TDD feedback mode,"In this work we study the problem of channel state feedback and user scheduling in a single cell downlink wireless network employing multiple orthogonal parallel channels. The aspect of the system we are focusing on is stability. For user scheduling for stability as a performance measure, both the queue and channel states need to be known by the base station. However channel states can be known only via feedback from the receivers. In order to collect CQI feedback from each user at one channel, a fraction of the available time for transmission is used. This means that the time left to transmit is getting smaller. We present a joint feedback and scheduling algorithm which can guarantee an expansion of the stability region with respect to prior works. We also provide expressions regarding the distribution of the time needed to be devoted for feedback at each channel in some special cases. The proposed algorithm does not need knowledge of the statistics of the channels and traffic patterns. Simulations illustrate the operation of the proposed scheme.","Destounis, Apostolos; Assaad, Mohamad; Debbah, Merouane; Sayadi, Bessem",2013.0,"2013 IEEE 24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERSONAL, INDOOR, AND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS (PIMRC)",,https://doi.org/
Can the use of reconfigurable antennas overcome the CSI bottleneck for FDD Massive MIMO?,"Massive MIMO has been proposed as a means of achieving huge spectral efficiency in cellular networks. However, its implementation is usually based on linear precoding schemes based on Channel State Information (CSI). For this reason, the use of the Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode is typically assumed since it removes the dependence on the number of antennas at the transmitter to acquire CSI. Unfortunately, most of the cellular network operate in the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode in which the acquisition of CSI depends proportionally on the number of transmit antennas. For this reason, the implementation of Massive MIMO is handicapped to few transmit antennas for the current cellular networks. In this paper we study the use of reconfigurable antennas that can switch among a set of preset modes, i.e., radiation patterns, through Blind Interference Alignment schemes. We show that it is a solution to exploit a very large number of antennas at the transmitter side, overcoming the bottleneck that today constitutes the acquisition of CSI in Massive MIMO systems operating in FDD mode.","Cespedes, Maximo Morales; Plata-Chaves, Jorge; Armada, Ana Garcia; Moonen, Marc; Vandendorpe, Luc",2017.0,2017 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (WCNC),,https://doi.org/

A novel approach to achieve unequal error protection for video transmission over 3G wireless networks,"In this paper, we present a novel unequal error protection technique that enhances the video transmission quality over wireless networks.

Two Frequency Reuse Schemes in OFDMA-TDD Based Two-hop Relay Networks,"Frequency reuse scheme is extremely important in multi-hop relay networks (MRNs), because some extra frequency resource should be elaborately allocated to Relay Stations (RSs). However the time and spatial reuse characteristics of RS should be taken into account in order to mitigate the co-channel interference. This paper presents two adaptive frequency reuse schemes for MRN by using different reuse patterns in different time zones of the same frame. In our schemes, reuse pattern of 1x3x1 is applied in the Relay Zone (RZ), and 1x3x3 is applied in the Access Zone (AZ). The former allows only the two RSs which are located farthest apart in one cell to share the same frequency portion; while in the latter two adjacent RSs may share the same resources. Analysis and simulation results show that both schemes improve the system throughput greatly. The comparison of coverage and throughput between the two schemes indicates that the latter scheme has better performance and an aggressive full reuse scheme could be utilized to all RSs.","Zhao, Zhengguang; Fang, Xuming; Zhu, Ying; Long, Yan",2010.0,2010 IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (WCNC 2010),,https://doi.org/

Defect reduction of laterally regrown GaN on GaN/patterned sapphire substrates,"Structural properties of GaN epilayers on wet-etched protruding and recess-patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs) have been investigated in detail using high-resolution double-crystal X-ray diffraction (DCXRD) and etch-pit density methods. The DCXRD results reveal various dislocation configurations on both types of PSSs. The etch pits of GaN on the recess PSS exhibit a regular distribution, i.e. less etch pits or threading dislocation density (TDD) onto the recess area than those onto the sapphire mesas. On the contrary, an irregular distribution is observed for the etch pits of GaN on the protruding PSS. A higher crystal quality of the GaN epilayer grown onto the recess PSS can be achieved as compared with that onto the protruding PSS. These data reflect that the GaN epilayer on the recess PSS could be a better template for the second epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) of GaN. As a result, the GaN epilayers after the ELOG process display the TDDs of around similar to 10(6) cm(-2). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating TDD Communication and Radar Sensing in Co-Located Planar Array: A Genetic Algorithm Enabled Aperture Design,"In this paper, we design interleaved transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) apertures co-located in one planar array for enabling joint communication and sensing. A fixed number of antennas in a rectangular configuration is allocable for the apertures, and we use a genetic algorithm to determine the allocation. We assume that the Tx aperture transmits one beam to an active communication user (downlink communication of time division duplex) and another beam for sensing the passive target, and the Rx aperture receives backscattered sensing signals simultaneously (full duplex). The array apertures' design criteria are based on the effect of interference mitigation when using linear beamforming. The optimal solution is determined when the side lobes for the beams are minimized at different scanning angles in the field of view. Our numerical results indicate that the near-optimal antenna allocation for the apertures does not perform uniformly for all desired beam directions, but yet, we could conclude a near-optimal solution based on the least discrepancy between the sidelobe suppression effects for the aperture patterns.","Alidoustaghdam, Hadi; Miao, Yang; Kokkeler, Andre",2022.0,2022 2ND IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON JOINT COMMUNICATIONS & SENSING (JC&S),10.1109/JCS54387.2022.9743500,https://doi.org/10.1109/JCS54387.2022.9743500
Beamspace Aware Adaptive Channel Estimation for Single-Carrier Time-varying Massive MIMO Channels,"In this paper, the problem of sequential beam construction and adaptive channel estimation based on reduced rank (RR) Kalman filtering for frequency-selective massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing single-carrier (SC) in time division duplex (TDD) mode are considered. In two-stage beamforming, a new algorithm for statistical pre-beamformer design is proposed for spatially correlated time-varying wideband MIMO channels under the assumption that the channel is a stationary Gauss-Markov random process. The proposed algorithm yields a nearly optimal pre-beamformer whose beam pattern is designed sequentially with low complexity by taking the user-grouping into account, and exploiting the properties of Kalman filtering and associated prediction error covariance matrices. The resulting design, based on the second order statistical properties of the channel, generates beamspace on which the RR Kalman estimator can be realized as accurately as possible. It is observed that the adaptive channel estimation technique together with the proposed sequential beamspace construction shows remarkable robustness to the pilot interference. This comes with significant reduction in both pilot overhead and dimension of the pre-beamformer lowering both hardware complexity and power consumption.","Guvensen, Gokhan M.; Ayanoglu, Ender",2017.0,2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC),,https://doi.org/
SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT BY BASE STATION ANTENNA PATTERN CONTROL FOR LAND MOBILE CELLULAR-SYSTEMS,"This paper proposes using an adaptive array in a base station for signal reception and transmission in order to increase the spectral efficiency without decreasing the cell radius. The adaptive array controls the directivity pattern of the base station to reduce co-channel interference during reception; the same array pattern is applied during transmission to prevent unnecessary illumination. Computer simulation results show that the cluster size can be reduced to one with time division duplexing (TDD), indicating that we can reuse the same frequency group at all cells, Thus, the improvement in spectral efficiency is as much as 16 fold that of an omni-antenna. Moreover, load sharing, which is expected to improve the channel utilization for unbalanced load situations, is available by cell overlapping. Frequency division duplexing (FDD) requires a weight adjust function to be applied for transmission since the difference in frequency between signal reception and transmission causes null positioning error. However, simple LMS-adjusting can provide a cluster size of one as well as cell overlapping when the frequency deference is 5%.","OHGANE, T",1994.0,IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS,,https://doi.org/

Downlink Training Codebook Design and Hybrid Precoding in FDD Massive MIMO Systems,"Interest in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is growing because of their potential ability to improve spectral and energy efficiency. Most prior work on massive AMMO considers TDD operation that relies on channel reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels, whereas most current cellular systems adopt FDD without channel reciprocity. In an FDD mode, downlink channel estimation becomes a challenging issue due to the substantial training overhead that. scales with the number of antennas, which can limit the potential gain of massive MIMO systems. To tackle the issue of channel estimation, we consider the design of a training codebook that has a suitable mapping for the training signal patterns in block transmissions under the assumption of a Kalman filtering framework. We focus on a reduced dimensionality training codebook and transmit precoding design to enable low-complexity system configuration. We discuss how this framework can extend to hybrid analog-digital precoding using a limited number of active RF chains for transmit beamforming by applying the Toeplitz distribution theorem to large-scale linear antenna arrays. A practical guideline for training codebook parameters is presented, and numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","Noh, Song; Zoltowski, Michael D.; Love, David J.",2014.0,2014 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM 2014),,https://doi.org/
Gradient-Based Predictive Pulse Pattern Control of Medium-Voltage DrivesuPart II: Performance Assessment,"In this article, the performance of gradient-based predictive pulse pattern control (GP<^>{3}C) is evaluated for a medium-voltage variable-speed drive consisting of a three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter and a medium-voltage induction machine. To this end, real-time tests are performed in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) environment, which, along with extensive simulation studies, elucidate the potential of performance gains achieved with GP<^>{3}C. As shown, by manipulating offline-computed optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) in real time such that the stator current of the machine follows a precalculated optimal current trajectory, superior steady-state and transient performance can be achieved. Specifically, the current total demand distortion (TDD) is significantly reduced compared with established control methods, such as field-oriented control (FOC) with space vector modulation (SVM), while shorter settling times during transients are achieved. Finally, to complete the assessment of the control method of interest, real-time implementation aspects are discussed in detail.","Begh, Mirza Abdul Waris; Karamanakos, Petros; Geyer, Tobias; Yang, Qifan",2022.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS,10.1109/TPEL.2022.3190713,https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2022.3190713
Interfacial reaction-controlled deposition and micropatterning of oxide thin films for gate dielectrics,"We have succeeded in fabricating micropatterns of TiO2 thin films on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). SAMs of OTS (octadecyltrichlorosilane) were formed on Si wafers and modified by UV irradiation using a photomask to generate octadecyl/silanol-pattern. They were used as templates to deposit TiO2 thin films by the use of TDD (titanium dichloride diethoxide) dissolved in toluene. Amorphous films were selectively deposited on silanol regions. Line width variation of the pattern was improved to be well below the current electronics design rule, 5%. Dielectric constant of an as-deposited TiO2 thin film, dielectric properties of TiO2/Si interface and leakage current density were evaluated by measuring I-V and C-V charactersitics of the MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) device. Very low leakage current was observed under high electric fields and the TiO2 thin films with various thicknesses showed dielectric constant of 25-30, which is more than 6 times as large as that of a usual SiO2 dielectric layer. This result indicates that TiO2 thin films synthesized at room temperature can replace with SiO2 layers currently employed for gate dielectrics of MOSFETs (MOS field-effect transistors).","Koumoto, K; Masuda, Y; Wang, DJ",2003.0,CERAMIC INTERFACES: PROPERTIES AND APPLICATIONS V,10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.253.139,https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.253.139
Light Output Enhancement of GaN-Based Light-Emitting Diodes by Optimizing SiO2 Nanorod-Array Depth Patterned Sapphire Substrate,"In this study, we investigated high-efficiency InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) grown on sapphire substrates with SiO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) of different heights. The GaN film showed an improved crystal quality through X-ray diffraction (XRD) full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), photoluminescence (PL), and cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. The light output power and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the fabricated LEDs were increased when compared with those of conventional LEDs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images suggested that the voids between SiO2 nanorods and the stacking faults introduced during the nanoscale epitaxial lateral overgrowth (NELOG) of GaN can effectively reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD). We believe that the improvements could be attributed to both the enhanced light extraction by utilizing SiO2 NRAs and the improved crystal quality through the NELOG method. We found that the sample with SiO2 NRA structures of 200 nm height can increase the LED output power by more than 70% in our study.

Antenna Grouping Based Feedback Compression for FDD-Based Massive MIMO Systems,"Recent works on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) have shown that a potential breakthrough in capacity gains can be achieved by deploying a very large number of antennas at the base station. In order to achieve the performance that massive MIMO systems promise, accurate transmit-side channel state information (CSI) should be available at the base station. While transmit-side CSI can be obtained by employing channel reciprocity in time division duplexing (TDD) systems, explicit feedback of CSI from the user terminal to the base station is needed for frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. In this paper, we propose an antenna grouping based feedback reduction technique for FDD-based massive MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm, dubbed antenna group beamforming (AGB), maps multiple correlated antenna elements to a single representative value using predesigned patterns. The proposed method modifies the feedback packet by introducing the concept of a header to select a suitable group pattern and a payload to quantize the reduced dimension channel vector. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves significant feedback overhead reduction over conventional approach performing the vector quantization of whole channel vector under the same target sumrate requirement.","Lee, Byungju; Choi, Junil; Seol, Ji-Yun; Love, David J.; Shim, Byonghyo",2015.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS,10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2460743,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2460743
Efficiency improvement of GaN-based ultraviolet light-emitting diodes with reactive plasma deposited AlN nucleation layer on patterned sapphire substrate,"The flip chip ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (FC UV-LEDs) with a wavelength of 365 nm are developed with the ex situ reactive plasma deposited (RPD) AlN nucleation layer on patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) by an atmospheric pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (AP MOCVD). The ex situ RPD AlN nucleation layer can significantly reduce dislocation density and thus improve the crystal quality of the GaN epitaxial layers. Utilizing high-resolution X-ray diffraction, the full width at half maximum of the rocking curve shows that the crystalline quality of the epitaxial layer with the (RPD) AlN nucleation layer is better than that with the low-temperature GaN (LT-GaN) nucleation layer. The threading dislocation density (TDD) is estimated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which shows the reduction from 6.8 x 10(7) cm(-2) to 2.6 x 10(7) cm(-2). Furthermore, the light output power (LOP) of the LEDs with the RPD AlN nucleation layer has been improved up to 30 % at a forward current of 350 mA compared to that of the LEDs grown on PSS with conventional LT-GaN nucleation layer.","Lee, Chia-Yu; Tzou, An-Jye; Lin, Bing-Cheng; Lan, Yu-Pin; Chiu, Ching-Hsueh; Chi, Gou-Chung; Chen, Chi-Hsiang; Kuo, Hao-Chung; Lin, Ray-Ming; Chang, Chun-Yen",2014.0,NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS,10.1186/1556-276X-9-505,https://doi.org/10.1186/1556-276X-9-505
Isotropic air-interface in TD-SCDMA: Uplink synchronization control and its environment-dependent performance analysis,"This paper addresses the issues on implementation of an isotropic air-link technology for future 4G wireless. One straightforward way is to use open-loop and closed-loop uplink synchronization (ULS) control techniques to turn asynchronous uplink back to synchronous operation mode. The use of ULS control can greatly enhance bilateral data transmission throughput in both uplink and downlink channels of a mobile cellular as a direct result from improved transmission imparity between them. This is especially important for some applications where the traffic in the both links should be made equally high, such as video conferencing. This paper will also introduce a modeling method to analyze performance of ULS control in a mobile cellular system. It should be noted that, although this paper's study is carried out under the TD-SCDMA framework, the method can be equally applicable to any TDD-based 3G and 4C wireless systems that choose ULS control as the means to achieve isotropic air-link transmission. A numerical analysis based on propagation delay estimation will be used to derive probability of successful ULS control under consideration of the impact of different channel environments, such as reflection coefficients, propagation patterns, attenuation gradient and cell size, etc.","Chen, HH; Yeh, YC; Chao, CY; Tsai, CH; Chang, WH",2003.0,"2003 IEEE 58TH VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE, VOLS1-5, PROCEEDINGS",10.1109/VETECF.2003.1285983,https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.2003.1285983
Quantitative description and model of molecule transport through skin,"The illustration of the electrical properties of skin and quantitative relations provides the theory and method for transdermal drug delivery by electroporation. The paper puts forward an electrical model of skin including conductance of appendageal, lipid, lipid-corneocyte matrix pathway and Nernst potential of charged drug molecule.

Training Sequence Design for Feedback Assisted Hybrid Beamforming in Massive MIMO Systems,"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication is an emerging technology that uses an excess of transmit antennas to realize high spectral efficiency. Achieving potential gains with large-scale antenna arrays hinges on sufficient channel estimation accuracy. Much prior work focuses on time-division duplex (TDD)-based networks, relying on reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels. However, most currently deployed commercial wireless systems are frequency-division duplex (FDD)-based, making it difficult to exploit channel reciprocity. In massive MIMO FDD systems, the problem of channel estimation becomes even more challenging due to the substantial training resources and feedback requirements which scale with the number of antennas. In this paper, we consider the problem of training sequence design and the mapping of training signals to training periods. We focus on reduced-dimension training sequence designs, along with transmit precoder designs, aimed at reducing both hardware complexity and power consumption. The resulting designs are extended to hybrid analog-digital beamforming systems, which employ a limited number of active RF chains for transmit precoding, by applying the Toeplitz distribution theorem to large-scale linear antenna systems.

Radioelectric compatibility of the Future Aeronautical Communication System,"The aeronautical community has recently decided to develop a new digital aeronautical communication system, named L-DACS, in order to fulfill the new air traffic requirements. This system, which will operate in the L frequency band (960 to 1164 MHz), would be internationally deployed from 2020. Many technologies were considered for this new aeronautical system but only two among them were preselected by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO): candidate one, named L-DACS1, is based on a FDD-OFDM technology and candidate two, named L-DACS2, is based on a TDD-GMSK technology. One of the most important issues for both candidates is the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with the legacy systems operating in the same band or/and in adjacent bands. Different scenarios have to be evaluated due to the fact that these systems will be implanted either in the airplanes (on board) or in ground stations. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the air-air scenario, where we focus on the signals generated by onboard L-DACS transmitters on onboard victim receivers, taking into account the L-DACS antenna radiation pattern and the frequency mask. The study emphasizes that the interference phenomenon can be one of the main limitations for the L-DACS development.","Neji, Najett; De Lacerda, Raul; Azoulay, Alain; Letertre, Thierry; Outtier, Olivier",2009.0,ITST: 2009 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS TELECOMMUNICATIONS,10.1109/ITST.2009.5399349,https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2009.5399349
Multi-Beam Multiple Access Scheme for Uplink Traffic of Wireless Virtual Reality with Millimeter-Wave Analog Beamforming,"Wireless Virtual Reality (VR) is a new-arising technology to enable the untethered connection between VR server and VR client, whose traffic characteristics include both ultrahigh data rate in downlink and periodic small-size data packets in uplink. The downlink requires ultra-wide bandwidth and hence leads to the usage of millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum with analog beamforming; however, this causes difficulty for the uplink: the efficient multiple access of small-packet users in the same mmWave carrier by time-division duplex (TDD). Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-beam multi-access scheme for the uplink traffic of multiple VR users with mmWave analog beamforming. Specifically, this scheme contains an analog beamforming weight determination function and a frequency-division user scheduling function, which are executed iteratively with the increasing number of selected users. Therein, the proposed multi-beam analog beamforming pattern generation method is able to generate arbitrary number of beams with flexible beam directions, beam widths and beamforming gain ratios, by the constant-modulus weights with one radio-frequency chain. It is demonstrated by the simulation results that the proposed multibeam multi-access scheme increases 200% for the maximum number of simultaneously served VR uplink users than the traditional single-beam multi-access scheme in 5G systems with mmWave analog beamforming.","Huang, Min; Wang, Jianfeng; Zhang, Xu",2018.0,2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS WORKSHOPS (ICC WORKSHOPS),,https://doi.org/
Epitaxial lateral overgrowth of AlN on self-assembled patterned nanorods,"We report an inexpensive nanoscale patterning process for epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) in AlN layers grown by metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on sapphire. The pattern was produced by an inductively coupled plasma etch using a self-assembled monolayer of silica spheres on AlN as the lithographic mask. The resulting uniform 1 mm length rod structure across a wafer showed a massive reduction in threading dislocations (TDs) when annealed at 1100 degrees C. Overgrowing homoepitaxial AlN on top of the nanorods, at a temperature of 1100 degrees C, produced a crack free coalesced film with approximately 4 mm of growth, which is formed at a much lower temperature compared to that typically required for microscale ELOG. The improved crystal quality, in terms of TD reduction, of the AlN above the rods was determined by detailed weak beam (WB) electron microscopy studies and showed that the threading dislocation density (TDD) was greatly reduced, by approximately two orders of magnitude in the case for edge-type dislocations. In situ reflectance measurements during the overgrowth allowed for thickness coalescence to be estimated along with wafer curvature changes. The in situ measurements also confirmed that tensile strain built up at a much slower rate in the ELOG AlN layer compared to that of AlN prepared directly on sapphire.","Conroy, Michele; Zubialevich, Vitaly Z.; Li, Haoning; Petkov, Nikolay; Holmes, Justin D.; Parbrook, Peter J.",2015.0,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C,10.1039/c4tc01536c,https://doi.org/10.1039/c4tc01536c
Performance optimization of cell-free massive MIMO system with power control approach,"The cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system involves a large number of access points serving a smaller number of mobile users (MUs) over identical time/frequency resource. By providing large number of service antennas closer to the MUs, the cell-free massive MIMO can offer great spectral efficiency, better macro-diversity and minimal path loss. Despite several advantages, the cell-free massive MIMO suffers from energy overloading caused by uncontrolled backhaul power consumption for large number of distributed access points (APs) and pilot contamination during channel estimation. In this paper, we have taken into consideration a cell-free massive MIMO system with APs equipped with multiple antennas performing time-division-duplex (TDD) operation. Here, all the APs coordinate through a constrained backhaul network for joint transmission of signals to all the users simultaneously by multiplying the received signal with the normalized conjugate of the estimated channel state information (CSI) and send back a rounded off version of the weighted pattern to the central processing unit (CPU). Finally, an effective user defined algorithm is presented involving selection and grouping of various APs based on their individual contributions for a particular MU to improve the overall performance of the system.

Effect of MOVPE growth conditions on AlN films on annealed sputtered AlN templates with nano-striped patterns,"The metalorganic vapor phase epitaxial (MOVPE) growth of AlN films was performed on face-to-face annealed sputtered AlN templates (FFA Sp-AlN) having a nano-striped pattern with a period of 300 nm and depth of 120 nm. Then, the effect of MOVPE growth conditions on the crystallinity was elucidated. The faceted structure clearly changed with the growth temperature (T-g), following the same trend as the epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN film on micro-patterned GaN. High T-g levels enhanced the lateral growth, and thus with a high T-g of 1300 degrees C, the coalescence in the early growth stage resulted in AlN films with coalesced surfaces and a thickness of 1 mu m. For the AlN film grown at a T-g of 1300 degrees C, the threading dislocation density (TDD) was estimated to be 6.0 x 10(8) cm(-2). This value proved that coalesced AlN films on nano-patterned FFA Sp-AlN templates with low TDDs could be achieved with the appropriate MOVPE growth conditions. The compressive strain in the AlN film on nano-patterned FFA Sp-AlN was lower than that of the film grown on FFA Sp-AlN without a pattern.","Iba, Yukino; Shojiki, Kanako; Kuboya, Shigeyuki; Uesugi, Kenjiro; Xiao, Shiyu; Miyake, Hideto",2021.0,JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH,10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2021.126237,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2021.126237
Physical Layer Security Design for Polar Code Construction,"In contrast to the network security that relies on upper-layer encryption for the confidentiality and authenticity of communications, physical layer security (PLS) exploits the uniqueness and randomness of the physical channel to encrypt information and enhance the security of the system. In this paper, we study the PLS of a polar-coded wireless communication system. To be more specific, we leverage the unique properties in polar code construction and propose a channel quality indicator (CQI)-based frozen-bit pattern generation scheme. The transmitter employs the Gaussian approximation algorithm to generate the corresponding frozen bit pattern according to the instantaneous CQI of the legitimate link. At the receiver, by leveraging the full channel reciprocity in the time-division duplex (TDD) mode, we can map the CQI to the corresponding frozen bit pattern and correctly decode the received bits. By contrast, the eavesdropper was unable to have the knowledge of the legal channel, and hence cannot determine the frozen bit pattern of the polar-coded bit sequence. Our simulation results demonstrate that by adopting the proposed PLS key generation scheme, Eve was hardly able to correctly decode a complete frame, leading to a high block error rate (BLER), while Bob was able to attain a 10(-5) BLER.","Zeng, Yao; Tang, Yuxi; Xiang, Luping",2022.0,CRYPTOGRAPHY,10.3390/cryptography6030035,https://doi.org/10.3390/cryptography6030035
Analytical Evaluation of Saturation Throughput of a Cognitive WLAN Overlaid on a Time-Scheduled OFDMA Network,"In this paper, we analyze the saturation throughput of a cognitive WLAN overlaid on a primary OFDMA TDD network (e.g., LTE or WiMAX). In this scenario, after the contention among the secondary nodes, the winner node transmits its data packet in the empty resource blocks (RBs) of downlink and uplink subframes of the primary network. Regarding the OFDMA structure as well as time-scheduled resources in the primary network, the time duration of opportunities for the secondary network does not follow simple exponential on-off pattern. To model the dynamic behavior of opportunities for secondary nodes as well as contentions to exploit the opportunities, we propose an analytical model comprised of a discrete-time Markov chain and two inter-related open multi-class queueing networks (QNs). The effects of the random number of empty resource blocks at different frames as the result of randomamount of download and upload data, random packet transmission time at WLAN, the dependency of the number of empty RBs at consecutive frames, and the details of 802.11 MAC protocol are included in our analytical approach. We include different resource allocations in the primary network in our analysis. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of our analytical approach in different conditions.","Rahimzadeh, Parisa; Ashtiani, Farid",2017.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING,10.1109/TMC.2016.2567387,https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2016.2567387
Security-Oriented Polar Coding Based on Channel-Gain-Mapped Frozen Bits,"In this paper, a novel design named security-oriented polar coding (SOPC) is proposed to enhance the physical layer security (PLS), where the active pattern of frozen bits in a transmission is determined by random channel gain of the legitimate link. Since the channel gain value is not exchanged between the legitimate transmitter and the desired receiver, eavesdroppers cannot ascertain the frozen bit pattern engaged in the legitimate polar coding. When the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, eavesdroppers are unable to appropriately decode the confidential information delivered over the legitimate link. As the SNR increases, eavesdroppers may have chance to sort out the correct frozen bit pattern through a brute-force search. However, this chance is significantly reduced by our SOPC. We design the SOPC for both single-input-single-output single-antenna eavesdropper (SISOSE) and multiple-input-multiple-output multi-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) channels. Its PLS functioning is assessed in terms of the error rate difference between the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Illustrative simulation results substantiate that the SOPC design guarantees degraded decoding performance at eavesdroppers, for both SISOSE and MIMOME channels, even in the presence of a powerful eavesdropper possessing infinite computational resources.","Yang, Yuli; Li, Wenyao",2022.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS,10.1109/TWC.2022.3151188,https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2022.3151188
Downlink Resource Allocation in Multiuser Cell-Free MIMO Networks With User-Centric Clustering,"In this paper, we optimize user scheduling, power allocation and beamforming in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks implementing user-centric clustering. We study both the coherent and non-coherent transmission modes, formulating a weighted sum rate maximization problem for each; finding the optimal solution to these problems is known to be NP-hard. We use tools from fractional programming, block coordinate descent, and compressive sensing to construct an algorithm that optimizes the beamforming weights and user scheduling and converges in a smooth non-decreasing pattern. Channel state information (CSI) being crucial for optimization, we highlight the importance of employing a low-overhead pilot assignment policy for scheduling problems. In this regard, we use a variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering, which provides a suboptimal, but feasible, pilot assignment scheme; for our cell-free case, we formulate an area-based pilot reuse factor. Our results show that our scheme provides large gains in the long-term network sum spectral efficiency compared to benchmark schemes such as zero-forcing and conjugate beamforming (with round-robin scheduling) respectively. Furthermore, the results show the superiority of coherent transmission compared to the non-coherent mode under ideal and imperfect CSI for the area-based pilot-reuse factors we consider.","Ammar, Hussein A.; Adve, Raviraj; Shahbazpanahi, Shahram; Boudreau, Gary; Srinivas, Kothapalli Venkata",2022.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS,10.1109/TWC.2021.3104456,https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2021.3104456
Application of patterned sapphire substrate for III-nitride light-emitting diodes,"Recent decades have witnessed flourishing prosperity of III-nitride emitters in solid-state lighting and high-resolution displays. As one of the widely used substrates, sapphire shows superiority for heteroepitaxial growth of III-nitride light-emitting diode (LED) structure, due to the advantages of stability, low cost, high mechanical strength, as well as mature fabrication technology. However, realization of efficient LEDs grown on sapphire substrate is impeded by high density of defects in epilayers and low light extraction efficiency. The emergence of patterned sapphire substrate (PSS) turns out to be a promising and effective technology to overcome these problems and enhance the LED performances. In this review, we first introduce the background and recent advances of PSS applied in III-nitride visible and ultraviolet LEDs are. Then, we summarize the fabrication methods of PSS, together with novel methods to define nanometre-scale patterned structures. We further demonstrate the effect of PSS that contributes to reduce the threading dislocation density (TDD) of epilayers in detail. Meanwhile, mechanism of light extraction efficiency enhancement by adopting PSS is presented based on numerical analysis. Next, we explore the influence of PSS structural parameters (e.g. pattern size, pattern shape and aspect ratio) on LED performances, spanning from visible to deep ultraviolet UV emission region. Finally, challenges and potential prospects in PSS for future LED development are proposed and forecasted as well.","Zhou, Shengjun; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Du, Peng; Zhang, Ziqi; Liu, Xu; Liu, Sheng; Guo, L.

Belief Propagation Pattern-Coupled Sparse Bayesian Learning for Non-Stationary Uplink Channel Estimation Over Massive-MIMO Based 5G Mobile Wireless Networks,"In this paper, we develop a novel sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) scheme for recovery of block-sparse uplink channels in time-division duplex (TDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) based SG mobile wireless networks. We first introduce a pattern-coupled hierarchical Gaussian prior to characterize the sparse channel dependency among neighboring antennas, where the dependency coefficient is modeled by birth-death process. Then, to derive hyperparameters, which are employed to control the sparsity of channel coefficients, we exploit an expectation-maximization (EM) formulation to iteratively maximize a lower bound on the posterior probability. In the M-step, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to maximize the lower bound efficiently. Finally, we develop a belief propagation (BP)-based pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning (PC-SBL) algorithm, referred to as the BP-PC-SBL, to recover block-sparse uplink channels. Based on the factor graph of block-sparse uplink channels, we show that messages in BP satisfy complex Gaussian probability distribution. Therefore, we only need to update their means and variances when updating the messages. BP-PC-SBL algorithm provides precise approximations of matrix inversion as computed by the conventional SBL algorithm, which results in significantly improved computational efficiency. Our numerical analyses validate and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes and algorithms.","Chen, Jianqiao; Zhang, Xi",2020.0,2020 54TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SCIENCES AND SYSTEMS (CISS),10.1109/CISS48834.2020.1570617107,https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS48834.2020.1570617107
Secure Single-Input-Multiple-Output Media-Based Modulation,"The media-based modulation (MBM) system, which varies its channel state by controlling the on/off status of the radio frequency (RF) mirrors, and embeds additional information bits into the mirror activation pattern, is capable of achieving significant throughput and desirable bit-error-rate (BER) performance. Hence, it has attracted increasing attention from researchers of wireless communication community. In this paper1, the information secrecy issue for MBM is investigated, and a secure single-input-multiple-output MBM (SIMO-MBM) system is proposed utilizing physical-layer security techniques. By considering the time-division duplexing (TDD) mode with channel reciprocity property, the legitimate channel state information (CSI) is applied to secure the data transmission of SIMO-MBM. More specifically, on one hand, adaptive phase rotation is imposed on the transmitted signals, where the rotation angle is determined by the phase of legitimate CSI; on the other hand, the mapping rule between the mirror activation pattern and binary bits is changed according to the amplitude of legitimate CSI. The BER performance of the eavesdropper is investigated via theoretical derivations, and the system secrecy mutual information is also derived, based on which the optimal design of the adaptive phase rotation strategy is provided. Theoretical and simulative results demonstrate that the proposed secure SIMO-MBM system is capable of enhancing the data confidentiality whilst keeping reliable data transmission.","Mao, Tianqi; Wang, Qi; Wen, Miaowen; Wang, Zhaocheng",2020.0,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY,10.1109/TVT.2020.2975303,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2020.2975303
A Threshold-Based Approach for Joint Active User Selection and Feedback in MISO Downlink Systems,"In this paper we study the downlink of a TDD (Time Division Duplex) single cell system where the Base Station (BS) employs multiple antennas to serve the users taking into account the traffic patterns. The BS chooses each slot the users to be active, and serves them using Zero Forcing (ZF) precoding. This requires the knowledge of the users' channels which is assumed to be performed e.g. via uplink training. Due to the channel acquisition overhead, only a subset of users must be active at each timeslot (depending on traffic patterns and channel states). In this paper, we develop an active user selection strategy where the base station sets a given threshold for the channel gain of the users. Then, only the users that have their channel gain higher than the threshold send their training sequence and are then considered to be served. The base station estimates the channel states of these users and, due to channel reciprocity, uses these channel states to transmit data via ZF precoding. With appropriate signaling and threshold selection, which adapt to the queuing behavior of the users, we prove that our proposed method achieves a larger stability region than the baseline centralized policy where the BS selects the users based on channel statistics and queue lengths. The performance of the threshold-based method is illustrated via simulations, where we can observe a tradeoff between the expansion of the stability region and delay performance.","Destounis, Apostolos; Assaad, Mohamad; Debbah, Merouane; Sayadi, Bessem",2015.0,2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC),,https://doi.org/
Human population structure and its effects on sampling Y chromosome sequence variation,"The excess of rare variants in global sequencing studies of the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome (NRY) has been interpreted as evidence for the effects of human demographic expansion. However, many NRY polymorphisms are geographically localized and the effect of different geographical sampling on patterns of NRY variation is unknown. We use two sampling designs to detect population structure and its effects on patterns of human NRY polymorphism. First, we sequence 26.5 kb of noncoding Y chromosome DNA from 92 globally distributed males representing 35 populations. We find that the number of polymorphisms with singleton variants is positively correlated with the number of populations sampled and that there is a significant negative correlation of Tajima's D (TDD) and Fu and Li's D (FD) statistics with the number of pooled populations. We then sequence the same region in a total of 73 males sampled from 3 distinct populations and find that TD and FD values for the 3 pooled and individual population samples were much less negative than those of TD seen in our pooled samples. These empirical and simulation results suggest that observed levels of NRY population structure may lead to an upward bias in the number of singleton variants in global surveys and call into question inferences of population expansion based on global sampling strategies.","Hammer, MF; Blackmer, F; Garrigan, D; Nachman, MW; Wilder, JA",2003.0,GENETICS,,https://doi.org/
Enhancement of light output power on GaN-based light-emitting diodes using two-direction stripe-patterned sapphire substrate,"To achieve both the reduction of threading dislocation density (TDD) and the enhancement of light extraction efficiency (LEE) of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), a two-directional stripe-patterned sapphire substrate (TPSS) was fabricated. First, a stripe pattern parallel to the a-axis of Al2O3 was formed on an as-received c-sapphire wafer and then a second stripe pattern rotated around 3 degrees from the m-axis of Al2O3 was formed on the first stripe PSS. The light output power of TPSS LEDs was around 1.25 times higher than that of LEDs on a flat sapphire substrate. This enhancement is caused by the increase of both the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and the LEE. On the other hand, although the LED on TPSS with the second stripe just parallel to the m-axis of Al2O3 showed a similar enhancement ratio of the light output power, the current leakage of this LED increased with the concentration of threading dislocations on the surface of LEDs. Stripes rotated 3 degrees from the m-axis of Al2O3 changed the growth mode and realized GaN films with a smooth surface without pit formation. Therefore, the misalignment of the stripe from the m-axis of Al2O3 will become a new design parameter for realizing high-efficiency reliable LEDs. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Cost/Revenue Tradeoff in the Optimization of Fixed WiMAX Deployment With Relays,"In fixed Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), the contribution from each transmission mode can be incorporated into an implicit formulation to obtain the supported throughput as a function of the carrier-to-interference ratio. This is done by weighting the physical throughput in each concentric coverage ring by the size of the ring. In this paper, multihop cells are formed by a central coverage zone and three outer coverage zones, which are served by cheaper low-complexity relays. Although the reuse distance in this case is augmented by a factor of root 3, we show that, with the use of relays in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) mode with an adapted time-division duplexing (TDD) uplink (UL) subframe structure to accommodate communication from/to the relay station (RS) to/from subscriber station (SS), only the consideration of trisectored base stations (BSs) with a reuse pattern of K = 3 enables attainment of values for the cell per sector throughput that is comparable with cases without the use of relays. Cost/revenue optimization results show that trisectored BSs in topologies with relays enable us to achieve more profitable reuse configurations than with omnidirectional BSs and no relays. Under the same total bandwidth and with the coverage distance set at R similar to 500 m, we show that it is preferable to consider K = 1 with three carriers per sector instead of K = 3 with one carrier per sector, whereby the profit in this case is increased from similar to 1000% to similar to 1450%. Furthermore, if the price [(sic)/MB)] is increased from 0.0025 to 0.005, the achievable profit more than doubles.","Velez, Fernando J.; Nazir, Muhammad Kashif; Aghvami, A.

Simulation Platform Development for Diabetes and Technology Self-Management,"Background: Specialized education is critical for optimal insulin pump use but is not widely utilized or accessible. We aimed to (1) test the usability and acceptability of A1Control, a simulation platform supporting insulin pump education, and (2) determine predictors of performance. Method: Rural adult insulin pump users with type 1 diabetes (T1D) participated in a mixed methods usability study in 2 separate rounds. Participants navigated 3 simulations (ie, infusion site occlusion, hypoglycemia, exercise). Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Systems Usability Scale (SUS) were administered. Semi-structured interviews and direct observation were used to assess perceived usability, acceptability and performance. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique was used to fit predictive models for visualization of patterns leading to good or poor A1Control performance. Results: Participants (N=13) were 28-70years old, 10 used automated insulin delivery and 12 used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Mean NPS was 9.5 (range 9-10) and positive sentiment during interviews indicated very high acceptability. SUS (mean 88.5, range 70-100) indicted a high perceived usability. CGM percent wear >= 94%, time spent in hypoglycemia <= 54mg/dl of <0.01%, and <70mg/dl of 0.5% predicted successful site-occlusion scenario performance with 100% accuracy. BOLUS score >= 2, TDD >= 34, and technology brand predicted exercise scenario success with 100% accuracy. There were an insufficient number of failed hypoglycemia scenarios to assess predictors. Conclusion: A1Control shows potential to increase access and frequency of self-management and technology education. Additional study is needed to determine sustained engagement and benefit.","Faulds, Eileen R.; Rayo, Michael; Lewis, Claudia; Noble, Carl W.; Gifford, Ryan; Happ, Mary Beth; Joyce, Lilly; Dungan, Kathleen",2022.0,JOURNAL OF DIABETES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,10.1177/19322968211029303,https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968211029303
Secure Quadrature Channel Modulation,"In this paper, a physical layer security (PLS) scheme based on quadrature channel modulation (QCM) called secure QCM (SQCM) is proposed for time division duplex (TDD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) media based modulation (MBM) systems to resist eavesdropping. By exploiting the abundant legitimate channel realizations generated by the radio frequency (RF) mirrors, secure mappings between the original information bits and the transmit patterns are designed, where the transmit patterns include the transmit antenna activation pattern (AAP), mirror activation pattern (MAP) and symbol modulation pattern. The secure mappings used by the transmitter change for each transmission and are unavailable at the eavesdropper due to the independent fading of the legitimate link and the eavesdropping link. Based on the secure mappings, the proposed SQCM conveys the source information bits securely through the complex modulation symbol and instantaneous channel realizations by using a single RF chain. The ergodic secrecy rate is analyzed and a closed-form approximation is derived. Simulation results show that the closed-form approximation coincides with the experimental ergodic secrecy rate, and the achievable ergodic secrecy rate is not influenced by the number of eavesdropping antennas or the channel advantage of the eavesdropping link. Compared to the secure MBM scheme using the traditional artificial noise (AN) technique, the proposed SQCM scheme shows significant performance gain without consuming jamming power when the eavesdropper has more antennas than the legitimate receiver. Compared to the precoded MBM and probabilistic optimized MBM schemes exploiting the eavesdroppers CSI, the proposed SQCM scheme has better secrecy performance in all SNR region and medium-to-high SNR regions respectively without requiring the eavesdroppers CSI.","Gao, Zhenzhen; Bai, Shaozhuang; Liao, Xuewen; Leung, Victor C.

Characterization of defects in Mg doped GaN epitaxial layers using conductance measurements,"Mg-doped GaN films have been grown on sapphire by metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. Two different buffer layer schemes between the film and the sapphire substrate were used, giving rise to differing threading dislocation densities (TDDs) in the GaN. Frequency-dependent capacitance and conductance measurements have been used to study the electronic states associated with the Mg doping, and to determine how these are affected by the TDD. Current-voltage and admittance spectroscopy measurements were carried out using Al/Au Schottky contacts and Ni/Au Ohmic contacts fabricated in a dot-and-ring pattern. Frequency-dependent measurements on these devices were corrected to remove the series resistance effects arising from the well known high resistivity of Mg-doped GaN using formulae derived from the equivalent parallel circuit model. Thermal admittance spectroscopy, in which the conductance is monitored as a function of temperature, verified the existence of a single impurity-related acceptor level in samples with different TDDs at 165 +/- 10 meV. For all of the samples the extrapolated capture cross-section values were very small, in the range of similar to 10(-20) cm(-2), suggesting that the acceptor level could be very repulsive. Since admittance spectroscopy detects only majority carrier traps, we believe these defect signature values are most probably associated with the Mg acceptor state as they are very close to the results previously reported by other research groups using different techniques.

Statistical analysis on the bandwidth of a dual frequency textile antenna,"A novel dual frequency, wide band textile antenna has been proposed. A slot cut out of a regular rectangular patch revealing a vertical dumbbell-shaped conducting region resonates at global positioning system (L1 and L3) and time division duplex long term evolution fourth generation bands. The radiation efficiencies of the antenna at the lower and upper resonant frequencies are 96 and 88%, respectively. The antenna is fabricated using double side silver coated conductive fabric on a denim substrate and experimentally validated. The textile antenna resonates from 1.435 to 1.81 GHz and from 2.755 to 3.19 GHz. The antenna has a bandwidth of 375 and 435 MHz, that is, fractional bandwidth of 25.08 and 12.6% at the lower and upper bands, respectively. The fabricated antenna is then subjected to bending, shear, stretching deformations and their effects on the bandwidth of the antenna are analysed using analysis of variance method. The significant factors and their percentage contribution on the bandwidth are also determined using the F-test. Finally, an empirical equation is derived for the designed antenna to compute the bandwidth and the results are validated.","Sundarsingh, Esther Florence; Ramalingam, Vimal Samsingh; Kanagasabai, Malathi",2015.0,IET MICROWAVES ANTENNAS & PROPAGATION,10.1049/iet-map.2015.0223,https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-map.2015.0223
Optical properties of InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates with low threading dislocation densities,"We have grown blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with low threading dislocation densities (TDDs) by using SiN interlayers on Si (111) substrates. Our growth technique using SiN layers makes it possible to decrease twist components (edge-type threading dislocation components). The edge-type TDDs are almost the same values as those of LEDs grown on Al2O3 (0001) substrates. EQE of LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates increases with decreasing edge-type dislocation in the low-current-density region, and the EQE of the sample with low TDD is almost as high as that of the LED grown on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate at room temperature. It is found that the hot/cold factors (HCFs) of LEDs grown on Si (111) substrates increase with decreasing edge-type dislocations in the low-current-density region, but are less than those of an LED grown on an Al2O3 (0001) substrate. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) shows that the dominant origin of the thermal quenching is edge-type dislocations in our samples, but other defects such as screw-type dislocations also contribute to it. We also found the fluctuated emission patterns consisting of bright and dark areas originated from the difference of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) type defect densities in the multi-quantum wells (MQWs) grown on Si (111) substrates. The bright areas spread, and the configurations of the bright areas change into ring-like patterns with reducing edge-type TDDs. We suggest that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of dark areas should be promoted to improve the performance of the MQWs grown on Si (111) substrates.","Kimura, Shigeya; Tajima, Jumpei; Nago, Hajime; Hikosaka, Toshiki; Yoshida, Hisashi; Uesugi, Kenjiro; Nunoue, Shinya",2014.0,GALLIUM NITRIDE MATERIALS AND DEVICES IX,10.1117/12.2038714,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2038714
Novel channel and polarization assignment schemes for 2-11 GHz fixed-broadband wireless access networks,"The scarcity of available spectrum in the 2-11 GHz frequency range and the continuously increasing number of users that require broadband communication services suggest that emerging fixed-broadband wireless access (F-BWA) networks will be deployed with aggressive frequency re-use to cope with capacity demands. In this context, co-channel interference may arise in high levels compromising the system's capacity and robust operation. Interference is further increased when limited directionality terminal antennas are employed to support non line-of-sight operation and in the case where an adaptive-time division duplex is selected for efficient radio resource management in asymmetric and time-varying traffic conditions. In this paper frequency channel assignment (CA) and antenna polarization assignment (PA) are considered as a means of mitigating interference. Two novel CA schemes that consider the distinct characteristics of F-BWA are proposed; the rotated-interleaved channel assignment and the non-uniform channel assignment. According to statistical interference simulation analysis the proposed schemes are more efficient in suppressing interference, achieving higher capacity compared to existing schemes while incurring no further complexity. In addition, instead of exploiting the performance of CA and PA schemes independently a framework for a joint CA-PA consideration is presented, where for a particular CA scheme an optimized PA pattern is developed. Results show that this approach improves the CA-PA interoperability increasing the overall performance. The efficiency of the proposed schemes is investigated for both FDD and adaptive-TDD schemes and is verified for various sectorization, frequency re-use and terminal antenna directivity configurations to ensure compatibility with different deployment scenarios.","Ntagkounakis, Konstantinos; Sharif, Bayan; Dallas, Panagiotis",2006.0,WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS,10.1007/s11277-005-9004-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11277-005-9004-7
Fabrication of large flat gallium nitride templates with extremely low dislocation densities in the 10(6) cm(-2) range by novel two-side hydride vapor-phase epitaxial growth,"Large GaN templates with high flatness (i.e., negligible wafer bowing and smooth as-grown surfaces) and low threading dislocation densities (TTDs) were fabricated by a novel two-side hydride vapor-phase epitaxial (HVPE) growth, beginning with deposition of polycrystalline GaN on the rear side of the wafer. Appropriate gas-flow management realized by our homemade HVPE system permitted the growth of a GaN layer with a smooth as-grown surface and excellent thickness uniformity on the front surfaces of 4- or 6-inch patterned sapphire substrates (PSSs). However, when the grown thickness exceeded 20 mu m, single-side HVPE-growth induced fractures in GaN crystals. The fracture resistance of the GaN increased markedly when it was in a cleavage-resistant polycrystalline form (poly-GaN), permitting its growth to a thickness of 100 mu m. In the presence of a back-side poly-GaN layer, extremely thick GaN crystal layers could be grown on the front side without fractures. An 80-mu m-thick GaN template fabricated by two-side growth on a 4-inch PSS had a device-quality surface, negligible bowing, and low TDD (7 x 10(6) cm(2)). Issues of high fabrication costs, unavailability of large-size wafers, and large off-angle variations associated with native GaN wafers could be overcome by using our high-quality GaN templates as alternative substrates.

Phenological and growth responses of Papaver radicatum along altitudinal gradients in the Canadian High Arctic,"Phenology and growth of Papaver radicatum Rottb. was monitored over four summers (1990-1993) at 12 sites, along a dolomitic and a granitic altitudinal gradient (330 m a.s.l.-770 m a.s.l.) at Sverdrup Pass, central Ellesmere Island, Canada. The gradients provided substantial differences in environmental characteristics. Three of the four seasons (1990, 1991 and 1993) had more than 400 thawing degree-days (TDD) in the valley, while the 1992 season had less than 300. The granitic sites had consistently higher temperatures than the dolomitic sites, despite their northerly aspect. Increasing elevation reduced total degree-day accumulation (c. 40 degree-days/100 m) and length of potential growing season. The proportion of the population producing flower buds was similar at all sites in any given year, but there were differences among years. Production of flowers and fruits per site, decreased with altitude along the dolomitic gradient in 1991 and 1992. There was no difference in the number of buds or flowers produced per plant with increasing altitude, although larger plants with multiple flowers were found only on low elevation granitic sites. Plants from the dolomitic sites were smaller and flowered, on average, after the site accumulated 150 degree-days, while plants on the granitic sites were larger and bloomed after 200 degree-days. Papaver is able to grow and reproduce over a wide range of environmental conditions and moderate climate warming would likely promote its growth and establishment, unless other factors, especially snow-free periods and water availability, become limiting.","Levesque, E; Henry, GHR; Svoboda, J",1997.0,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,10.1111/j.1365-2486.1997.gcb145.x,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.1997.gcb145.x
Quantitative measurement feasibility for 3D distributions of hydrodynamic quantities in the turbulent mixing zone of two gases,"In doing research on the turbulent mixing (TM) of two gases different in density, it is of great interest to study experimentally the 3D density distribution pattern of chemically nonreactive gases in the TM zone. For this purpose, noncontact and, particularly, optical techniques to obtain experimental data may be attractive. This article discusses the possibility of using pulsed laser interferometry in this application. Based on this technique, the experiment should result in the mixture density distribution integrated along the light path. Requirements for high-quality interference patterns have been analyzed in application to typical experimental conditions, to show that they may be produced with specific restrictions set on the mixture constitution. Generally, the TM zone has no symmetry. Therefore, the problem of reconstructing 3D density distributions (TDD) of gases can be solved by sufficiently providing many TM zone integral projections (or aspects). It is technically difficult and expensive to achieve this large number of aspects (N>10). Therefore, it is essential that a reconstruction method be selected to allow the solution of the problem with the least possible number of aspects. Given that the experiment data are incomplete, the reconstruction methods that are based on the concept of maximum data entropy did well. Information a priori about the solution to be sought for an isobaric gas mixture is that its each constituent has invariable density. Thus, a functional data entropy can be defined that is similar to Fermi gas in statistical physics. An algorithm has been suggested for reconstruction as a modified maximum-bounded entropy procedure (Bashurin et al. 1995). This makes reasonable good reconstruction achievable even with as few aspects as N=4. Experiments on the study of TM of a propane jet in air using a four-aspects laser interferometer were provided and reconstruction of propane concentration distribution was conducted. The results allow determination of the TM zone spectral characteristics.","Bashurin, VP; Bashurov, VV; Bogunenko, YD; Bondarenko, GA; Pletenev, FA; Starodubtsev, VA",1997.0,LASER AND PARTICLE BEAMS,10.1017/S0263034600010764,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0263034600010764
Recent Advances in Fabricating Wurtzite AlN Film on (0001)-Plane Sapphire Substrate,"Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor materials, with bandgaps far wider than the 3.4 eV of GaN, have attracted great attention recently. As a typical representative, wurtzite aluminum nitride (AlN) material has many advantages including high electron mobility, high breakdown voltage, high piezoelectric coefficient, high thermal conductivity, high hardness, high corrosion resistance, high chemical and thermal stability, high bulk acoustic wave velocity, prominent second-order optical nonlinearity, as well as excellent UV transparency. Therefore, it has wide application prospects in next-generation power electronic devices, energy-harvesting devices, acoustic devices, optical frequency comb, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and laser diodes. Due to the lack of low-cost, large-size, and high-ultraviolet-transparency native AlN substrate, however, heteroepitaxial AlN film grown on sapphire substrate is usually adopted to fabricate various devices. To realize high-performance AlN-based devices, we must first know how to obtain high-crystalline-quality and controllable AlN/sapphire templates. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in fabricating wurtzite AlN film on (0001)-plane sapphire substrate. First, we discuss the control principles of AlN polarity, which greatly affects the surface morphology and crystalline quality of AlN, as well as the electronic and optoelectronic properties of AlN-based devices. Then, we introduce how to control threading dislocations and strain. The physical thoughts of some inspirational growth techniques are discussed in detail, and the threading dislocation density (TDD) values of AlN/sapphire grown by various growth techniques are compiled. We also introduce how to achieve high thermal conductivities in AlN films, which are comparable with those in bulk AlN. Finally, we summarize the future challenge of AlN films acting as templates and semiconductors. Due to the fast development of growth techniques and equipment, as well as the superior material properties, AlN will have wider industrial applications in the future.","Wu, Hualong; Zhang, Kang; He, Chenguang; He, Longfei; Wang, Qiao; Zhao, Wei; Chen, Zhitao",2022.0,CRYSTALS,10.3390/cryst12010038,https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst12010038
Field investigations on the survival of Escherichia coli and presence of other enteric micro-organisms in biosolids-amended agricultural soil,"Aims: To measure the survival of enteric micro-organisms in agricultural soil amended with conventional and enhanced treated biosolids in relation to environmental and edaphic conditions. Methoda and Results: Escherichia coli, Salmonella and F-specific RNA bacteriophage were enumerated in sludge and amended soil. Salmonella was not detected and only small numbers of bacteriophages were found in conventional, dewatered mesophilic anaerobically digested biosolids (DMAD). Neither organism was detected in soil. Escherichia coli numbers in soil increased with DMAD application compared with the unamended control, or soil receiving enhanced treated, thermally dried digested (TDD) and composted (CPT) biosolids. Empirical statistical models were developed summarizing the relationship between soil temperature, moisture content and time and E. coli populations. Background numbers of E. coli declined with increasing soil temperature and decreasing soil moisture responding to seasonal patterns in environmental conditions. Time following application was the only significant explanatory variable of E. coli numbers and decay in DMAD-amended soil. Conclusions: E. coli are an indigenous component of the microbial community in field soil and populations increased in cool, moist soil during autumn-winter and declined in warm, dryer soil during spring-summer. Enhanced treated biosolids were not a source of E. coli, but reduced the size of the indigenous population possibly by stimulating the activity of predatory and competing soil flora because of the organic substrate input from sludge. Conventionally treated biosolids increased E. coli numbers in soil. However, introduced bacteria declined rapidly and survival was limited to 3 months, irrespective of the timing of sludge application or environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results provide assurance that residual numbers of pathogens applied to soil in treated biosolids decay to background values well within cropping and harvesting restrictions imposed when sewage sludge is spread on farmland.","Lang, N.

Groundwater discharge in high-mountain watersheds: A valuable resource for downstream semi-arid zones. The case of the Berchules River in Sierra Nevada (Southern Spain),"Aquifers in permeable formations developed in high-mountain watersheds slow down the transfer of snowmelt to rivers, modifying rivers' flow pattern. To gain insight into the processes that control the hydrologic response of such systems the role played by groundwater in an alpine basin located at the southeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula is investigated. As data in these environments is generally scarce and its variability is high, simple lumped parameter hydrological models that consider the groundwater component and snow accumulation and melting are needed. Instead of using existing models that use many parameters, the Temez lumped hydrological model of common use in Spain and Ibero-American countries is selected and modified to consider snow to get a simplified tool to separate hydrograph components. The result is the TDD model (Temez-Degree Day) which is applied in a high mountain watershed with seasonal snow cover in Southern Spain to help in quantifying groundwater recharge and determining the groundwater contribution to the outflow. Average groundwater recharge is about 23% of the precipitation, and groundwater contribution to total outflow ranges between 70 and 97%. Direct surface runoff is 1% of precipitation. These values depend on the existence of snow. Results are consistent with those obtained with chloride atmospheric deposition mass balances by other authors. They highlight the important role of groundwater in high mountain areas, which is enhanced by seasonal snow cover. Results compare well with other areas.

A Methodology to Characterize Power Control Systems for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields Generated by Massive MIMO Antennas,"The fifth-generation (5G) New Radio (NR) cellular network has been launched recently. The assignment of new spectrum bands and the widespread use of Massive MIMO (MaMIMO) and beamforming techniques for better radio coverage are two major features of the new architecture. They imply both opportunities and challenges, one of the most daring one among the latter ones is the research for methods to assess human exposure to electromagnetic fields radiated by the base stations. The long-term time-varying behavior and spatial multiplexing feature of the MaMIMO antennas, along with the radio resource utilization and adoption of Time-Division Duplexing (TDD), requires that the assessment of exposure to electromagnetic fields radiated by 5G systems is based on a statistical approach that relies on the space and time distribution of the radiated power. That, in turn, is determined through simulations based on the actual maximum transmitted power - defined as the 95(th) percentile of the empirical distribution obtained from historical data of radiated power - rather than on the nominal one. To ensure that exposure limits are never exceeded, a monitoring and control system (usually referred to as Power Lock (PL)) that limits the transmitted power can be used. In this paper we propose a methodology, independent from the specific technical solution implemented by the manufacturer, to characterize such control systems and determine their capability to limit the average power transmitted over a given time interval to a value that keeps the corresponding average exposure to electromagnetic fields below a specified value. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the methodology and that it can also be used to identify when the PL interacts with the higher levels of the MaMIMO system architecture.","Adda, Sara; Aureli, Tommaso; Coltellacci, Stefano; D'Elia, Stefano; Franci, Daniele; Grillo, Enrico; Pasquino, Nicola; Pavoncello, Settimio; Suman, Riccardo; Vaccarono, Mattia",2020.0,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024764,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3024764
Mineralization of biogenic materials in the water masses of the South Atlantic Ocean. I: Assessment and results of an optimum multiparameter analysis,"This is the first of two manuscripts dealing with the circulation, mixing, ventilation and organic matter mineralization of the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO). The present work quantifies the complex mixing of water masses in the SAO using a constrained, least-squares regression, Optimum MultiParameter (OMP) analysis. The OMP based on temperature, salinity, silicate and the conservative parameter NO, was applied on two World Ocean Circulation (WOCE) lines, A17 and A14, in the western and eastern SAO, respectively. The constrained OMP sensitivity to sources of error in the end-member characteristics, measured parameters, equation weights and oxygen to nitrogen mineralization ratio (RN) was carefully assessed using perturbation tests. Perturbation of RN was the only test that changed significantly the mixing proportions although by less than 5%. The constrained OMP method allowed defining the realm and identifying the core-of-flow of each water mass to study its circulation, the evolution of its chemical composition and, eventually, to separate the contribution of physical and biogeochemical processes. Relevant specific outputs of this first manuscript are: (1) north of the South Equatorial Current, the silicate maximum is primarily composed of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) rather than Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW); (2) the two degree discontinuity (TDD) experiences a dramatic meridional change of water masses composition, being dominated by North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) north of the Vema Channel and by CDW southwards; (3) the 50% proportion horizon of Weddell Sea Deep Water (WDSW), with a 0 of -0.3 degrees C at the entry of the SAO, defines the upper limit of the WSDW realm more properly than the classical isopycnals of 46.04 or 46.06 sigma(4), where the proportion of WSDW is around 75%.

The design and implementation of Super Base Station side L1C system in TD-LTE pattern,"The Super Base Station project was proposed by the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The super base station of Centralized architecture can integrate multimode mobile communication system, save operator costs, reduce energy consumption, increase the transmission rate. The physical layer protocol has not explicitly stated the various states of physical layer as well as the interface with high-level in 3GPP LTE standard specification, so the physical layer control (L1C) solution was designed and implemented, mainly responsible for achieving high-level interactive information, data movement, and start physical channel. The physical layer baseband processing is based on TMS320TCI6618 multi-core DSP, where L1C system is located on core0, and core1, core2 are respectively used for processing uplink and downlink data signal. This article defines the three states of the physical layer, boot and other configuration scheduling process on the base station side is actualizes by state transition. When the subframe scheduling is going, through the multi-task scheduling and double buffering double pointer technology of the DSP, data storage and transfer is completed properly, and the startup and shutdown of different channels is completed according to different criteria. Stipulate the interface content with Protocol Stack, and communicate with it through the Ethernet port, multi-core DSP use IPC for the inner communication and regulate. Verification process is divided into two parts, numerical comparison and link level simulation. Data comparison is performed through a packet capture software omnipeek verify that no packet loss. After the deployment of the physical layer control use the manner of breakpoints debug and memory viewer to observe, data which has throughed the IPC also correct. The whole process of link is a Video transmission, through the software decoding, the base station side downstream transmission protocol stack, physical layer, and the physical layer of terminal receives, protocol stack. Finally through store, the Video can play out by original software. Entirety test correct, transfer content freedom from error, no conflict with other modules.","Peng, Boya; Chang, Jun",2016.0,2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS-CHINA (ICCE-CHINA),,https://doi.org/
"Delimiting the genus Staphylococcus through description of Macrococcus caseolyticus gen. nov., comb. nov. and Macrococcus equipercicus sp. nov., Macrococcus bovicus sp. nov. and Macrococcus carouselicus sp. nov.","Four species of the newly proposed genus Macrococcus, namely Macrococcus caseolyticus gen. nov., comb, nov. (formerly Staphylococcus caseolyticus Schleifer, Kilpper-Balz, Fischer, Faller and Endl 1982, 19(VP)), Macrococcus equipercicus sp. nov., Macrococcus bovicus sp. nov. and Macrococcus carouselicus sp. nov., are described on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis comparing 16S rRNA sequences, DNA-DNA liquid hybridization, DNA base composition, normalized ribotype patterns, macrorestriction pattern analysis and estimation of genome size using PFGE, cell wall composition, phenotypic characteristics and plasmid profiles. Compared with their closest relatives, members of the genus Staphylococcus, these organisms demonstrated significantly lower 16S rRNA sequence similarities (93.4-95.3 %), higher DNA G+C content (38-45 mol%), absence of cell wall teichoic acids (with the possible exception of M. caseolyticus), unique ribotype pattern types and macrorestriction patterns, smaller genome size (approx. 1500-1800 kb) and generally larger Gram-stained cell size (1.1-2.5 mu m in diameter). Macrococci can be distinguished from most species of staphylococci (except Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus vitulus and Staphylococcus lentus) by their oxidase activity. The four Macrococcus species can be distinguished from one another on the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization, ribotype pattern types, macrorestriction patterns and their phenotypic properties, including colony morphology, cell morphology, haemolysins, Staph Latex agglutination, acid production from a variety of carbohydrates, acetoin production, nitrate reduction, aesculin hydrolysis, and DNase and urease activities. The type species is M. equipercicus. The type strains of M. equipercicus, M. caseolyticus, M. bovicus and M. carouselicus are ATCC 51831(T) (= DD 9350(T)), ATCC 13548(T) (= TDD 4508(T)) (Schleifer et al. 1982), ATCC 51825(T) (= DD 4516(T)) and ATCC 51828(T) (= DD 9348(T)), respectively.","Kloos, WE; Ballard, DN; George, CG; Webster, JA; Hubner, RJ; Ludwig, W; Schleifer, KH; Fiedler, F; Schubert, K",1998.0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC BACTERIOLOGY,10.1099/00207713-48-3-859,https://doi.org/10.1099/00207713-48-3-859
"Dryness/wetness pattern over the Three-River Headwater Region: Variation characteristic, causes, and drought risks","The dryness/wetness patterns are a significant reference for stakeholders in developing reasonable strategies in regard to water resource management, prediction, prevention of extreme events, and management of agricultural activities; however, no attempts have been made to systematically quantify the dryness/wetness patterns and drought conditions over the Three-River Headwater Region (TRHR) of China, where the ecosystem is highly sensitive to climate change. The spatio-temporal characteristics of dryness/wetness for TRHR, as well as the reference evapotranspiration (ETr), precipitation (Pre), and drought risk, were all investigated for the period of 1961-2015. Using the methods of FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the Manner-Kendall (M-K) test, Pettitt test, factor contribution rate, and correlation analysis, the variation in the patterns of dryness/wetness, ETr, and Pre, and the causes behind dryness/wetness were discussed. Results indicated that the TRHR underwent a wetting tendency, which was characterized by decreasing ETr and increasing Pre based on the SPEI-12M during 1961-2015. Moreover, 1971-1980 was the driest period, while 2001-2015 was the wettest period. A significant difference between seasons was detected in the dryness/wetness patterns during all study periods, as well as in extreme droughts. The TRHR underwent an overall wetting trend with 85% of the stations' SPEI-3M showing increased variation during spring, in contrast with the north-south distribution pattern of the dryness/wetness with variation in the SPEI during summer. Moreover, it can be seen that droughts with higher longest drought duration (LDD) and total drought duration (TDD) were mostly located on the edge of the eastern and northern TRHR. The influencing factors demonstrate the vital roles of Pre and ETr in generating variation in the dryness/wetness patterns of the southern and northern parts of the TRHR, respectively. There is evidence indicating that Nino3.4, North Atlantic oscillation, and Arctic oscillation played more important roles in the variation of dryness/wetness patterns and Pre in TRHR.","Li, Sisi; Yao, Zhijun; Wang, Rui; Liu, Zhaofei",2020.0,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,10.1002/joc.6413,https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.6413
