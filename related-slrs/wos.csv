Consequently, numerous tools, techniques, paradigms, and strategies that facilitate the quality assurance of the developed applications have emerged. Test-driven development (TDD) is one of those strategies. In contrast to the traditional approach, it places testing ahead of the actual implementation, which, in turn, also heavily influences the system's design. With the approach being rather complex, naturally, guidance on its correct application is one of the most relevant aspects for many practitioners. To provide assistance to them, but also to researchers concerned with the domain, the publication at hand identifies twenty guidelines for the practical application of TDD in software engineering, by conducting a structured literature review. In doing so, it provides a solid foundation for the implementation of corresponding endeavors as well as a starting point for further discussion.","[Staegemann, Daniel; Volk, Matthias; Pohl, Matthias; Haertel, Christian; Hintsch, Johannes; Turowski, Klaus] Otto von Guericke Univ, Univ Pl 2, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany","Otto von Guericke University","Staegemann, D (corresponding author), Otto von Guericke Univ, Univ Pl 2, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.","daniel.staegemann@ovgu.de; matthias.volk@ovgu.de; matthias.pohl@ovgu.de; christian.haertel@ovgu.de; johannes.hintsch@ovgu.de; klaus.turowski@ovgu.de",,"Volk, Matthias/0000-0002-4835-919X; Staegemann, Daniel/0000-0001-9957-1003; Pohl, Matthias/0000-0002-6241-7675",,,,,42,0,0,1,3,"SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2367-3370","2367-3389","978-981-19-2397-5; 978-981-19-2396-8","LECT NOTE NETW SYST",,,2023,465,,,,,,327,336,,"10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-2397-5_30",,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Telecommunications","BU3ZT",,,,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000894285700030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Existing literature reviews show varying results for TDD. Objective: This study investigates how the conclusions of existing literature reviews change when taking two study quality dimension into account, namely rigor and relevance. Method: In this study a systematic literature review has been conducted and the results of the identified primary studies have been analyzed with respect to rigor and relevance scores using the assessment rubric proposed by Ivarsson and Gorschek 2011. Rigor and relevance are rated on a scale, which is explained in this paper. Four categories of studies were defined based on high/low rigor and relevance. Results: We found that studies in the four categories come to different conclusions. In particular, studies with a high rigor and relevance scores show clear results for improvement in external quality, which seem to come with a loss of productivity. At the same time high rigor and relevance studies only investigate a small set of variables. Other categories contain many studies showing no difference, hence biasing the results negatively for the overall set of primary studies. Given the classification differences to previous literature reviews could be highlighted. Conclusion: Strong indications are obtained that external quality is positively influenced, which has to be further substantiated by industry experiments and longitudinal case studies. Future studies in the high rigor and relevance category would contribute largely by focusing on a wider set of outcome variables (e.g. internal code quality). We also conclude that considering rigor and relevance in TDD evaluation is important given the differences in results between categories and in comparison to previous reviews. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is no consensus in the literature about the impact of TDD on the productivity of development teams. Furthermore, no studies were found that analyzed the productivity impact of TDD practitioners in relation to the variations of total project term and complexity of product. Based on three case studies, organized in 18 scenarios, this work used modeling and discrete-event simulation to investigate the impact of TDD on team productivity. The results showed that both factors, total project duration and product complexity, do influence the productivity of the software development team that adopts TDD practice and the most advantageous scenarios were identified. A Fuzzy Logical System was also implemented that recommends TDD based on these two variables.","[Sambinelli, Fernando; Ursini, Edson L.; Borges, Marcos A.

Method: In this study, a systematic literature review has been conducted considering articles published between 1999 and 2014. Results: In about 57% of the analyzed studies, the results were validated through experiments and in 32% of them, validation was performed through a case study. The results of this analysis show that 76% of the studies have identified a significant increase in internal software quality while 88% of the studies identified a meaningful increase in external software quality. There was an increase in productivity in the academic environment, while in the industrial scenario there was a decrease in productivity. Overall, about 44% of the studies indicated lower productivity when using TDD compared to TLD. Conclusion: According to our findings, TDD yields more benefits than TLD for internal and external software quality, but it results in lower developer productivity than TLD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) are techniques that have been recently adopted by the software industry and have evolved from agile practices. These techniques aim at improving both the quality of the delivered software and the developers' productivity. They are several studies that have been conducted on TDD in both academic and industry settings with however only a few on BDD. While TDD and BDD have both become popular, many organizations and developers still do not understand the differences between these concepts or where they overlap. The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of these two approaches in terms of external code quality, internal code quality and developers' productivity. To understand the weaknesses and strengths of each of these methods, a literature review was first performed. An experiment was then carried out in an industry setting to observe the effectiveness of TDD and BDD on a number of subjects. Our results showed that both techniques indeed increased the external quality of the delivered product. However, a decrease in productivity and internal quality were noted when BDD was used compared to TDD which might be due to the additional steps involved in BDD.","[Dookhun, Avishek Sharma; Nagowah, Leckraj] Univ Mauritius, Software & Informat Syst, Reduit, Mauritius","University of Mauritius","Dookhun, AS (corresponding author), Univ Mauritius, Software & Informat Syst, Reduit, Mauritius.","avishek.dookhunl@umail.uom.ac.mu; l.nagowah@.uom.ac.mu",,"Nagowah, Leckraj/0000-0003-2932-8096",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,"978-1-7281-3778-0",,,,2019,,,,,,,366,371,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BP3BX",,,,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000546185300071","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Therefore, massive MIMO is an attractive technology for next generation wireless conununication systems and for green communications. There are two operation modes: time-division duplex (TDD) and frequency-division duplex (FDD) for massive MIMO systems, and the debate on the two modes is still discussed in the literature. The originator of massive MIMO systems, Marzetta, has presented the basic frame structures for both the TDD and the FDD modes. However, the basic frame structures do not carefully take the hardware impairments such as phase noise (PN) into account. In this paper, by taking the PN as the key hardware impairment into account, we recommend new and efficient frame structures for both the TDD and the EDI) modes. The corresponding performance comparison between the two modes is also provided by using the data transmission efficiency (DTE) as the performance measurement. The comparison may help determine which mode should he used for massive MIMO systems.","[Wang, Yi-Fan] Airoha Technol Corp, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Lee, Ju-Hong] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Commun Engn, Taipei, Taiwan","National Taiwan University","Wang, YF (corresponding author), Airoha Technol Corp, Hsinchu, Taiwan.","yfw.ieee@gmail.com; jhlee@ntu.edu.tw","Lee, Ju-Hong/IST-5062-2023",,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST103-2221-E002-123-MY3, MOST106-2221-E-002-062]","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was also supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under Grants MOST103-2221-E002-123-MY3 and MOST106-2221-E-002-062.",,30,0,0,0,0,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1525-3511",,"978-1-5386-1734-2","IEEE WCNC",,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BK3SU",,,,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000435542402076","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is considered as one technique to be used in next generation wireless networks. Utilizing time division duplexing (TDD) aids the management of resources and providing effective QoS. In the literature, common approaches in assessing effectiveness attempt to capture performance using single indicators that reflect one aspect of the network's operation. consequently, multi-objective evaluations are not easy and require intuitively considering isolated descriptions, plots, visualizations, and holistically performing multiple comparisons. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework that aims to classify the effectiveness of joint scheduling algorithms over TDD-OFDMA networks per combined heterogeneous properties. In the suggested framework, a designer benefits from a bouquet of carefully customized indicators that can lead to quality evaluations, performance classifications beyond traditional approaches, and accurate improvements. Validation includes exhaustive simulations and the assessment of different scheduling and performance classification schemes. The obtained results confirm the validity of the framework and confirms its effectiveness in application.","[Damaj, Issam W.; El Hajj, Ahmad M.] Beirut Arab Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Debbieh 11072809, Lebanon; [Mouftah, Hussein T.] Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Beirut Arab University; University of Ottawa","Damaj, IW (corresponding author), Beirut Arab Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Debbieh 11072809, Lebanon.","i.damaj@bau.edu.lb",,"El-Hajj, Ahmad/0000-0002-5434-3821",,,,,27,6,6,0,2,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536",,,"IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access",,2019,7,,,,,,144214,144229,,"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945849","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945849",,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","VJ6SZ",,"gold",,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000617339900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this paper, we argue that user association policies are strongly coupled with the allocation of resources between UL and DL. We propose an algorithm that decomposes the problem into separate subproblems that can each be solved efficiently and in a distributed manner, and prove convergence to the global optimum.

The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of a new factor, the chosen task, and the development approach on external quality in an industrial experimental setting with 17 professionals. The participants are junior to senior developers in programming with Java, beginner to novice in unit testing, JUnit, and they have no prior experience in TDD. The experimental design is a 2 x 2 cross-over, i.e., we use two tasks for each of the two approaches, namely TDD and incremental test-last development (ITLD). Our results reveal that both development approach and task are significant factors with regards to the external quality achieved by the participants. More specifically, the participants produce higher quality code during ITLD in which splitting user stories into subtasks, coding, and testing activities are followed, compared to TDD. The results also indicate that the participants produce higher quality code during the implementation of Bowling Score Keeper, compared to that of Mars Rover API, although they perceived both tasks as of similar complexity. An interaction between the development approach and task could not be observed in this experiment. We conclude that variables that have not been explored so often, such as the extent to which the task is specified in terms of smaller subtasks, and developers' unit testing experience might be critical factors in TDD experiments. The real-world appliance of TDD and its implications on external quality still remain to be challenging unless these uncontrolled and unconsidered factors are further investigated by researchers in both academic and industrial settings.","[Tosun, Ayse] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Engn, TR-34467 Sariyer, Turkey; [Dieste, Oscar; Vegas, Sira; Juristo, Natalia] Univ Politecnica Madrid, Escuela Tecn Super Ingenieros Informat, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Pfahl, Dietmar] Univ Tartu, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia; [Rungi, Kerli] Testlio OY, Tartu, Estonia","Istanbul Technical University; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; University of Tartu","Tosun, A (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Engn, TR-34467 Sariyer, Turkey.","tosunay@itu.edu.tr; odieste@fi.upm.es; svegas@fi.upm.es; dietmar.pfahl@ut.ee; kerli.rungi@gmail.com; natalia@fi.upm.es","Tosun, Ayse/B-4794-2014; Dieste, Oscar/K-6193-2014; Pfahl, Dietmar Alfred Paul Kurt/H-3084-2015; VEGAS, SIRA/R-6742-2018","Tosun, Ayse/0000-0003-1859-7872; Dieste, Oscar/0000-0002-3060-7853; Pfahl, Dietmar Alfred Paul Kurt/0000-0003-2400-501X; VEGAS, SIRA/0000-0001-8535-9386","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities [PGC2018-097265-B-I00]; Estonian Centre of Excellence in ICT Research (EXCITE)","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities; Estonian Centre of Excellence in ICT Research (EXCITE)","This work was supported in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities under research under Grant PGC2018-097265-B-I00, and by the Estonian Centre of Excellence in ICT Research (EXCITE).",,53,1,1,0,2,"IEEE COMPUTER SOC","LOS ALAMITOS","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA","0098-5589","1939-3520",,"IEEE T SOFTWARE ENG","IEEE Trans.

Two patterns of frequency reuse (FR) per category are used. The simulation results showed that by increasing the number of BS antennas with a fixed number of symbols dedicated to the UL phase and vice versa, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the LS and MMSE estimators using the superimposed pilot (SuP) or StP is asymptotically approaches the NMSE of the LS and MMSE estimators using the RP, respectively.

The full-duplex (FD) schemes of in-band FD (IBFD), as well as multicarrier division duplex (MDD), may overcome this drawback while retaining the key benefits of both TDD and FDD. Moreover, the MDD exhibits the exclusive benefits of the reduced peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) for signal transmission as well as the SI-free signal detection.

Although promising, each base station needs accurate estimation of the channel state information (CSI), either through feedback or channel reciprocity schemes in order to achieve the benefits of massive MIMO in practice. Time division duplex (TDD) has been suggested as a better mode to acquire timely CSI in massive MIMO systems. The use of non-orthogonal pilot schemes, proposed for channel estimation in multi-cell TDD networks, is considered as a major source of pilot contamination in the literature due to the limitations of coherence time. Given the importance of pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems, we provide an extensive survey on pilot contamination, and identify other possible sources of pilot contamination, which include hardware impairment and non-reciprocal transceivers. We review established theories that have analyzed the effect of pilot contamination on the performance of massive MIMO systems, particularly on achievable rates. Next, we categorize the different proposed mitigation techniques for pilot contamination using the following taxonomy: pilot-based approach and subspace-based approach. Finally, we highlight the open issues, such as training overhead, deployment scenario, computational complexity, use of channel reciprocity, and conclude with broader perspective and a look at future trends in pilot contamination in massive MIMO systems.","[Elijah, Olakunle; Leow, Chee Yen; Rahman, Tharek Abdul] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Wireless Commun Ctr, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Nunoo, Solomon] Univ Mines & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Tarkwa, Ghana; [Iliya, Solomon Zakwoi] Natl Space Res & Dev Agcy NASRDA, CSTD, Abuja, Nigeria","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","Elijah, O (corresponding author), Univ Teknol Malaysia, Wireless Commun Ctr, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.","elij_olak@yahoo.com; bruceleow@fke.utm.my; tharek@fke.utm.my; snunoo@ieee.org; solozakwoi@gmail.com","LEOW, CHEE YEN/J-9206-2018; Nunoo, Solomon/G-5205-2013","LEOW, CHEE YEN/0000-0001-6418-0184; Nunoo, Solomon/0000-0003-3494-9313","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia (MOSTI); Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia [4S079, 4F261, 05H39, 07085]","Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia (MOSTI)(Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change (MESTECC), Malaysia); Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE); Universiti Teknologi Malaysia","This research was supported by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation Malaysia (MOSTI), the Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE), and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under Project Vote No. 4S079, 4F261, 05H39, and 07085.",,138,256,262,2,68,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",,"1553-877X",,"IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT","IEEE Commun.

To improve the low diversity order, we propose X-and Y-Codes, prior to SVD precoding, to pair subchannels having different diversity orders. Specifically, a pair of channels is jointly encoded using a 2 x 2 real matrix, which is fixed a priori and does not change with each channel realization. Moreover, we propose X-, Y-Precoders with the same encoding matrices as X-, Y-Codes, which adapt to each channel realization. The optimal encoding matrices for X-and Y-Codes/Precoders are derived analytically to minimize the average error probability. Finally, we see that X-, Y-Codes/Precoders indeed achieve higher diversity gains at very low encoding/decoding complexity for both well-and ill-conditioned channels, respectively, when compared to other precoding schemes in the literature.

The I/Q linear phase imbalance (LPI) is the key of the I/Q imbalance, which consists of the time delay deviation (TDD) and the local oscillator (LO) phase offset. TDD is negligible in most literature, but it degrades system performance largely for wideband communication systems. This paper proposes a method based on the cross-power spectrum between the I/Q signal to address the estimation problem of LPI. Compared with other conventional methods, the proposed approach calculates LPI parameters simultaneously without any additional hardware. The MATLAB simulation is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the presented method. Moreover, the experimental platform of detailed design demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed estimation method, and IRR of the system before and after compensation shows that LPI has been accurately estimated and eliminated with the help of an appropriate compensation structure.

The protocol employs contention -based reservation mechanisms in a topology-dependent way and executes in a fully-distributed manner It explicitly takes into account vagaries of radio propagation and co-channel interference, often oversimplified in the literature. A computer simulator is created that implements realistic large-scale radio propagation and considers all co-channel interferers in the network.

In this tertiary study, 13 secondary studies were included for detailed analysis. Given the heterogeneity of the data, we were unable to perform a rigorous synthesis. Instead, we mapped the identified Agile and Lean practices, and their impacts on the project constraints described in PMBOK. From 13 secondary studies, we identified 13 Agile and Lean practices. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is studied in ten secondary studies, meanwhile other practices are studied in only one or two secondary studies. This tertiary study provides a consolidated view of the impacts of Agile and Lean practices. The result of this tertiary study indicates that TDD has a positive impact on external quality.

The proposed work is to construct an expert advisory system of hybrid architecture, which is to determine the optimistic disease growth because of the thyroid gland. A string matching system (SMS) was at the outset developed, which can predict the actual TDD based on the knowledge available. If the SMS fails, an individual approaches using artificial bee colony optimization and particle swarm optimization are developed to achieve the accuracy of results appreciating the measure values as 65 and 93 %, but the results obtained using the above said approaches are calculated using some missed attribute values which are not included in the knowledge likewise left blank and hence the proposed work continues to first generate the missing attribute value in the knowledge by using rough data sets theory and the obtained data (missed attribute values) is given to predict optimistic disease along with its prevention and its curing methods.

The suffix tree is a versatile data structure that can be used to evaluate a wide variety of queries on sequence datasets, including evaluating exact and approximate string matches, and finding repeat patterns. However, methods for constructing suffix trees are often very time-consuming, especially for suffix trees that are large and do not fit in the available main memory. Even when the suffix tree fits in memory, it turns out that the processor cache behavior of theoretically optimal suffix tree construction methods is poor, resulting in poor performance. Currently, there are a large number of algorithms for constructing suffix trees, but the practical tradeoffs in using these algorithms for different scenarios are not well characterized. In this paper, we explore suffix tree construction algorithms over a wide spectrum of data sources and sizes. First, we show that on modern processors, a cache-efficient algorithm with O(n(2)p) worst-case complexity outperforms popular linear time algorithms like Ukkonen and McCreight, even for in-memory construction. For larger datasets, the disk I/O requirement quickly becomes the bottleneck in each algorithm's performance. To address this problem, we describe two approaches. First, we present a buffer management strategy for the O(n(2)) algorithm. The resulting new algorithm, which we call Top Down Disk-based (TDD), scales to sizes much larger than have been previously described in literature. This approach far outperforms the best known disk-based construction methods. Second, we present a new disk-based suffix tree construction algorithm that is based on a sort-merge paradigm, and show that for constructing very large suffix trees with very little resources, this algorithm is more efficient than TDD.","Intel Corp, Microarchitecture Res Lab, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Intel Corporation; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Hankins, RA (corresponding author), Intel Corp, Microarchitecture Res Lab, 2200 Mission Coll Blvd, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA.","ytian@eecs.umich.edu; tatas@eecs.umich.edu; richard.a.hankins@intel.com; jignesh@eecs.umich.edu",,"Tian, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-6835-8434",,,,,49,34,41,0,4,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","1066-8888","0949-877X",,"VLDB J","VLDB J.","SEP",2005,14,3,,,,,281,299,,"10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00778-005-0154-8",,,19,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science","968LS",,"Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000232164600002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We show that the signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) used in previous work suffers from significant drawbacks that limit its potential use in WSR maximization. We address this by proposing a new performance measure, the signal-to-leakage-plus-interference-plus-noise ratio (SLINR), which incorporates intra-cell interference and inter-cell leakage. The SLINR exploits the benefits of the SLNR approach, but by explicitly including interference, avoids many of its flaws. We derive an iterative and decentralized resource allocation approach under imperfect CSI, and our simulation results show that, despite BSs using only local information, the proposed algorithm comes within 3.8% of the throughput achieved by centralized schemes.","[Gamvrelis, Tyler; Li, Zehua; Khan, Ahmad Ali; Adve, Raviraj S.] Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada","University of Toronto","Gamvrelis, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada.","ty.gamvrelis@mail.utoronto.ca",,"Adve, Raviraj S./0000-0003-0224-2209",,,,,24,0,0,1,1,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536",,,"IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access",,2022,10,,,,,,123956,123970,,"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3224197","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3224197",,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","7V3FL",,"gold",,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000912702700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

An AAS is typically subject to hardware impairments that negatively impact network capacity. Hence, this article focuses on impairments that cause phase and magnitude errors between radio frequency (RF) chains and shows why they are particularly difficult to avoid in practical AAS. Although previous investigations show these impairments to degrade performance, they are not useful in deriving measurable impairment margins for practical FD-MIMO deployments. Knowing impairment limits are critical for system designers to make hardware design tradeoffs such as AAS configuration, component selection, implementation complexity, and cost. Moreover, it also helps set conformance limits for critical lab verification. Therefore, the paper first investigates the impact of the impairments and derives their practical limits for FD-MIMO by explicitly considering the cumulative effects of the channel model, inter-cell interference, link adaptation, and channel aging due to feedback delays. It is shown that a lower number of digitized RF chains can be a better choice under lower impairments. Next, the sources of impairments are investigated by using measurements carried out in the lab and the field during live operation in a commercial LTE network. Phase drift from local oscillators (LO) and internal temperature variations are identified as two significant sources. The tradeoffs and shortcomings of some of the existing solutions in massive MIMO literature are discussed. Finally, in order to address the shortcomings, a novel and practical coherent LO distribution architecture and array calibration mechanism are proposed. This solution is shown to be applicable to both TDD and FDD FD-MIMO. Measurement results are provided to prove the high degree of coherency and stability achieved on a unique array architecture called high definition active antenna system (HDAAS).","[Vaghefi, Reza Monir; Palat, Ramesh Chembil; Marzin, Giovanni; Feng, Yiping; Banu, Mihai] Blue Danube Syst Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; [Basavaraju, Kiran] Motorola Mobil, Chicago, IL 60654 USA","Legend Holdings; Lenovo","Vaghefi, RM (corresponding author), Blue Danube Syst Inc, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA.","vaghefi@vt.edu","Feng, Yiping/T-3653-2019",,,,,,62,2,2,0,3,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536",,,"IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access",,2020,8,,,,,,152680,152696,,"10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018393","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018393",,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","NG8DU",,"gold, Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000564211000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Two common features, i.e., the hand-crafted and the deep-learned ones are usually adopted for video representation and have been proven to be effective in many famous datasets in the literature. However, the hand-crafted feature lacks the ability to detect the discriminative and semantic features and the deep-learned one fails to outperform previous hand-crafted feature. This paper propose a novel symmelet-based classification approach to improve the accuracy of the state-of-the-art frameworks. Symmelet is a symmetrical pair including a SURF point and its corresponding symmetrical point in the same frame. Many symmetrical properties often exist in various video scenes. With symmelets, various redundant (or background) features can be filtered out so that action contents can be more accurately represented. The new approach takes advantages of symmelets, improved dense trajectories (IDT), and trajectory-pooled deep-convolutional descriptor (TDD) to learn useful deep features for represent video contents deeply. Performance evaluation on two challenging datasets, i.e., HMDB51 and UCF101 shows that the proposed solution is superior and can achieve quite higher recognition accuracy than other state-of-art frameworks.","[Alghyaline, Salah; Hsieh, Jun-Wei] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 2 Beining Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan; [Chuang, Chi-Hung] Fo Guang Univ, Dept Learning & Digital Technol, Yilan, Taiwan","National Taiwan Ocean University; Fo Guang University","Alghyaline, S (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 2 Beining Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,0,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1062-922X",,"978-1-5386-1645-1","IEEE SYS MAN CYBERN",,,2017,,,,,,,414,419,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BJ7RJ",,,,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000427598700073","View Full Record in Web of Science"

MIMO is an established standard in the WIMAX family, however practical literature on the exploitation of MIMO in WIMAX networks focused on treating the paradoxical situation of demand for Line Of Sight (LOS) in microwave communications against the essential MIMO prerequisite, i.e., the Non LOS (NLOS) and multi fade paths. This framework proposes a novel approach to exploit potentials of MIMO in WIMAX networks. This is achieved by exploiting spatial diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites (MAS) to create artificial NLOS environment, whereby, MAS(s) are encapsulated as antennas in a large scale frame. This presents a significant enhancement of the existing schemes, which highlighted the exploitation of the combination of Time Division Duplexing (TDD), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and MIMO for Multiple Access Points (MAP(s)) in a Single Frequency Network (SFN). In this paper, the network is divided into layers and the above exploitation of MIMO is realised between these layers in a network-to-network communication scenario. The resulting network is characterized by high capacities at distribution access points and ease of design by virtue of combination of SFN and spatial techniques.","Omdurman Alahlia Univ, Omdurman, Sudan",,"El Sanousi, GTA (corresponding author), Omdurman Alahlia Univ, Omdurman, Sudan.","geilielsanousi@hotmail.com",,,,,,,28,1,1,0,1,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,"978-1-4244-4307-9",,,,2009,,,,,,,79,84,,,,,,6,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Theory & Methods","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science","BNL30",,,,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000274849100014","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To fully exploit these advantages, an accurate estimation of the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) between each transmit-receive antenna pair is crucial. In literature, it has been demonstrated that wireless communication tends to have a sparse structured CIR in delay and/or spatial domains. Several channel estimation strategies have exploited the sparsity in the massive MIMO channel based on additional assumptions on shared common support between uplink channels. In this paper, we propose a general approach which highlights the individual sparsity in the different uplink channels without any other additional assumption. To achieve this purpose, a training sequence, also known as pilot sequence and compressed sensing based CIR estimation techniques have been proposed for the massive MIMO sparse uplink channels. In order to underline the performance of proposed techniques, a comparison in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) is performed with other CS algorithms. The simulation results have shown that proposed algorithm presents a performance gain between 5 dB and 10 dB in terms of NMSE, and a gain of 1dB to 9dB in terms of BER.","[Lahbib, Noura Derria; Cherif, Maha; Hizem, Moez; Bouallegue, Ridha] Carthage Univ, Sup Com, Innov Com, Tunis, Tunisia","Universite de Carthage","Lahbib, ND (corresponding author), Carthage Univ, Sup Com, Innov Com, Tunis, Tunisia.","nouraderria.lahbib@supcom.tn","Hizem, Moez/GNP-4889-2022",,,,,,25,2,2,0,1,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","2376-6492",,"978-1-5386-7747-6","INT WIREL COMMUN",,,2019,,,,,,,1680,1684,,,,,,5,"Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BO0MP",,,,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000492150100286","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Under these initiatives, substantial savings can be realized by carefully incorporating all outbound shipment strategy with inventory replenishment decisions. The impact is particularly tangible when the shipment strategy calls for a consolidation program where several smaller deliveries are dispatched as a single combined load, thereby realizing the scale economies inherent in transportation. Recognizing a need for analytical research in the field, this chapter concentrates on two central areas in shipment consolidation: i) analysis of pure consolidation policies where a shipment consolidation program is implemented on its own without coordination, and ii) analysis of integrated policies where outbound consolidation and inventory control decisions are coordinated under recent supply-chain initiatives. The chapter presents a research agenda, as well as a review of the related literature, in these two areas.

Based on the nature of transmitting common message to groups of users simultaneously, there exists a rich literature discussing the resource allocation under various constraints. However, the practical acquisition of CSI has not been fully explored when the number of multi-groups is large and the band is narrow. The insufficient sounding reference signal resources lead to the limited Channel Estimation Capacity (CEC). Under this case, even with Multi-User (MU) channel estimation techniques, some users still cannot be estimated in-timely, which introduces degradation. Aiming at this problem, in this paper we provide a preliminary exploration on CEC enhancement. Based on Denoising Convolutional Neuron Network (DnCNN), which is recently proposed and has succeeded in image denoising, we propose MU-DnCNN Channel Estimation (M-DnCNN CE). M-DnCNN CE includes three parts. First, we modify the utilization of SRS sequences. Then we establish the feature maps and propose M-DnCNN to denoise the signals. Finally, a matched channel restoration method is provided. The practical 3-D MIMO channel model is utilized to evaluate the performance. Compared with DFT-based and conjugated separation methods, results show that the performance of M-DnCNN CE is robust and superior, and the CEC is remarkably improved on the premise of satisfying latency constraint.","[Zeng, Tianyi; Wang, Yafeng; Li, Junyao; Hou, Shuai] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Minist Educ, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China","Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications","Wang, YF (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Minist Educ, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.","wangyf@bupt.edu.cn",,"Zeng, Tianyi/0000-0002-5644-1601","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61871049]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61871049.",,40,2,2,2,7,"IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC","PISCATAWAY","445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA","2169-3536",,,"IEEE ACCESS","IEEE Access",,2019,7,,,,,,177616,177627,,"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958060","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958060",,,12,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","KF8JT",,"gold",,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000509483800023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

There are little empirical evidences supporting or refuting the utility of these techniques in an industrial context. Just a few case studies can be found in literature within the industrial environment and they show conflicting results (positive, negative and neutral). In this report, we present a successful application of UTDD in combination with ATDD in a commercial project. By successful we mean that the project goals are reached without an extra economic cost. All the UTDD and ATDD implementations are based on the same basic concepts, but they may differ in specific adaptations to each project or team. In the implementation presented here, the business requirements are specified by means of executable acceptance tests, which then are the input of a development process where the functional code is written in response to specific unit tests. Our goal is to share our successful experience in a specific project from an empirical point of view. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of adopting UTDD and ATDD and identify some conditions that facilitate success. The main conclusions we draw from this project are that ATDD contributes to clearly capture and validate the business requirements, but it requires an extensive cooperation from the customer; and that UTDD has not a significant impact neither on productivity nor on software quality. These results cannot be generalized, but they point out that under some circumstances a test-driven development strategy can be a possible option to take into account by software professionals.","[Latorre, Roberto] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Escuela Politecn Super, Dpto Ingn Informat, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Latorre, Roberto] NeuroLog Soluc Informat, Madrid 28037, Spain","CIVIS; Autonomous University of Madrid","Latorre, R (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Escuela Politecn Super, Dpto Ingn Informat, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.","roberto.latorre@uam.es","Latorre, Roberto/F-9436-2012","Latorre, Roberto/0000-0003-3835-7905",,,,,49,9,9,0,23,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1382-3256","1573-7616",,"EMPIR SOFTW ENG","Empir.

While most papers in maMIMO literature assume orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), current standards such as long-term evolution (LTE) employ single-carrier (SC) waveform in the UL because of several benefits. We, thus, perform a systemic comparison between two fundamental schemes: the time-reversal MRC (TR-MRC) operating under SC, and the frequency-domain MRC (FD-MRC) employed with OFDM. On the one hand, it was recently shown that the TR-MRC outperforms the FD-MRC in terms of achievable rates, since SC systems do not require the cyclic prefix of OFDM. On the other hand, the computational complexity of the TR-MRC algorithm is higher than that of the FD-MRC algorithm, even when efficient solutions are employed (e.g., fast convolution with the overlap-andadd method). Hence, the best scheme for the UL maMIMO systems still remains an open question. The main contribution of this paper is the comparison of the total energy efficiency of both the TR-MRC and FD-MRC algorithms when used in the UL of maMIMO systems. Our results show that, for current typical system parameters, the FD-MRC/OFDM scheme achieves higher total energy efficiency than that achieved by the TR-MRC/SC scheme. However, if the cell radius is less than 300 m and/or the computational efficiency increases by 30% regarding the current processors, the TR-MRC algorithm under SC waveform becomes a much more attractive alternative for the UL of maMIMO systems.","[Marinello Filho, Jose Carlos; Abrao, Taufik] Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Elect Engn, BR-86057970 Londrina, Brazil; [Panazio, Cristiano] Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Commun & Signals, Polytech Sch, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Tomasin, Stefano] Univ Padua, Dept Informat Engn, I-35131 Padua, Italy","Universidade Estadual de Londrina; Universidade de Sao Paulo; ARQUS; University of Padua","Abrao, T (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Londrina, Dept Elect Engn, BR-86057970 Londrina, Brazil.","zecarlos.ee@gmail.com; cpanazio@lcs.poli.usp.br; taufik@uel.br; tomasin@dei.unipd.it","Abrao, Taufik/G-2347-2012; Tomasin, Stefano/AAZ-5198-2021; Panazio, Cristiano M/D-6277-2012; Panazio, Cristiano/X-8643-2019; Marinello, José Carlos/ABI-7425-2020; Tomasin, Stefano/AAF-6122-2020","Abrao, Taufik/0000-0001-8678-2805; Tomasin, Stefano/0000-0003-3253-6793; Panazio, Cristiano/0000-0003-3905-6338; Marinello, José Carlos/0000-0002-0980-8220; Tomasin, Stefano/0000-0003-3253-6793","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) of Brazil [304066/2015-0, 404079/2016-4]; Londrina State University, Paran State Government (UEL)","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) of Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Londrina State University, Paran State Government (UEL)","This work was supported in part by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) of Brazil under Grants 304066/2015-0 and 404079/2016-4, in part by Londrina State University, Paran State Government (UEL), and in part by Escola Politcnica of the University of So Paulo (EPUSP).

In order to support massive MIMO, i.e., a very large number of antennas at the base station (BS) side, the overhead incurred by conventional DL probing and UL feedback schemes scales linearly with the number of BS antennas and, therefore, may be very large. In this paper, we present a new approach to achieve a very competitive trade-off between spatial multiplexing gain and probing-feedback overhead in such systems. Our approach is based on two novel methods: (i) an efficient regularization technique based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that learns the Angular Spread Function (ASF) of users channels and permits to estimate the DL covariance matrix from the noisy i.i.d. channel observations obtained freely via UL pilots (UL-DL covariance transformation), (ii) a novel sparsifying precoding technique that uses the estimated DL covariance matrix from (i) and imposes a controlled sparsity on the DL channel such that given any assigned DL pilot dimension, it is able to find an optimal sparsity level and a corresponding sparsifying precoder for which the effective channel vectors after sparsification can be estimated at the BS with a low mean-square error. We compare our proposed DNN-based method in (i) with other methods in the literature via numerical simulations and show that it yields a very competitive performance. We also compare our sparsifying precoder in (ii) with the state-of-the-art statistical beamforming methods under the assumption that those methods also have access to the covariance knowledge in the DL and show that our method yields higher spectral efficiency since it uses in addition the instantaneous channel information after sparsification.","[Khalilsarai, Mandi Barzegar; Song, Yi; Yang, Tianyu; Haghighatshoar, Saeid; Caire, Giuseppe] Tech Univ Berlin, Commun & Informat Theory Grp CommIT, Berlin, Germany","Technical University of Berlin","Khalilsarai, MB (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Commun & Informat Theory Grp CommIT, Berlin, Germany.","m.barzegarkhalilsarai@tu-berlin.de; yi.song@tu-berlin.de; tianyu.yang@tu-berlin.de; saeid.haghighatshoar@tu-berlin.de; caire@tu-berlin.de","Caire, Giuseppe/Q-7275-2018","Caire, Giuseppe/0000-0002-7749-1333",,,,,26,1,1,0,0,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","1058-6393",,"978-1-7281-4300-2","CONF REC ASILOMAR C",,,2019,,,,,,,199,206,,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications","BP2PR",,"Green Submitted",,,"2023-08-01","WOS:000544249200040","View Full Record in Web of Science"
